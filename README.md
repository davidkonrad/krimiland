## Motivation
This [report](https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/Contents.htm), made by the german '*Group of Experts*' (as they call themselves) are by many people considered as one of the most comprehensive and thorough expert analysis of the [MS Estonia ferry disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Estonia), 1994.

However, while the report is online and available for anyone to read, it is convoluted inside a 20 year old website layout, hard to navigate and overview.  To read the report you need to click back and forth hundreds of times, and will for sure at some point loose context and orientation. 

That is really a shame. This is why I have collected the report and most of the enclosures, and compiled them into more reader friendly PDF's.
