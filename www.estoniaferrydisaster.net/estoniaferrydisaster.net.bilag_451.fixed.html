    Hamburg/Date WH/PH/hz July 22nd, 1996 "ESTONIA"</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2">Dear Börje,</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"> Several months have passed since our last contact in writing &#13;
    and although we have recently spoken a few times on the phone, we would like &#13;
    to put down on paper a number of items which we consider to be of relevance &#13;
    before your respective investigations are finalised and the Final Report is &#13;
    completed.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"> <b>I.</b> Our letter dated 22.01.96 in reply to your letter &#13;
    of 21.12.95 has not been commented on by you at all. Consequently, we do assume &#13;
    that all the items raised in your letter have been answered respectively commented &#13;
    by us to your satisfaction, as has been confirmed by you recently during one &#13;
    of our telephone conversations. Nevertheless, we shall revert to some of the &#13;
    items further down as new information/evidence has been obtained in the meantime.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"> <b>II.</b> We have read the interview which Olof Forsberg &#13;
    gave the magazine "Stern" some weeks ago with interest, in particular his &#13;
    remarks concerning the quality of our work found our attention. In order to &#13;
    clarify our position with regard to the so-called FELIX Report please accept &#13;
    the following explanations: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2">1. We had received a translation of 5 pages (out of 85) &#13;
      of the FELIX Report from Spiegel TV with the request to find out whether &#13;
      the results of our investigation would confirm or disprove the allegation &#13;
      of the FELIX Report "that crew members had attempted to open the visor at &#13;
      sea". Before doing so we have cross-checked certain other allegations made &#13;
      in this Report in Tallinn and found them to be basically confirmed.<br/></font><font size="2">2. When reviewing our information/documentation it &#13;
      became obvious to us that certain observations of survivors - all of which &#13;
      were told to the criminal police during the interrogations on the first &#13;
      days after the casualty - but also particular circumstances which, so far, &#13;
      remained unexplained, could make sense if indeed crew members had tried &#13;
      to open the visor some time before the casualty sequence.<br/>&#13;
      3. We conveyed our findings to Spiegel TV and "Der Spiegel" where they were &#13;
      published in distorted form. <br/>&#13;
      4. In anticipation of the reaction of the media following the publication &#13;
      of Spiegel TV/Spiegel Magazine on 14th/15th April, we had prepared a press &#13;
      release (enclosure no. 1) which, we believe, makes our position quite clear, &#13;
      i.e. we have never said or written that we believe the allegations of the &#13;
      FELIX Report in connection with "Estonia" to be true, but that <i>assuming</i> &#13;
      that they should be true the stated observations of survivors and particular &#13;
      circumstances - as lined out in our press release - could make sense. So &#13;
      much for the FELIX Report. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"><b>III. Evidence from the Wreck <br/></b></font><font size="2">We were most surprised to learn from the Swedish &#13;
    media that your Commission has stated it needed no more evidence from the &#13;
    wreck. During our last meeting in Stockholm you had told us that you would &#13;
    make sure that the interesting items would be brought up respectively taken &#13;
    on video film before the covering commences. How is this discrepancy to be &#13;
    understood? Why are you no longer interested in bringing light into certain &#13;
    matters which do need clarification, if for no other reason than to avoid &#13;
    the creation of legends? We have been requested from various sides during &#13;
    the last weeks to state what we consider necessary to be brought up respectively &#13;
    to be examined/filmed on site and have summarised this in a letter, which &#13;
    is attached as enclosure no. 2. The letter was initially written upon request &#13;
    of Henning Witte, the lawyer representing the DIS-Group of Relatives (Bendreus) &#13;
    in their efforts to persuade the Swedish Government to postpone the covering &#13;
    until at least your final report has been published. The letter was subsequently &#13;
    also sent to Swedish TV stations, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter (Anders &#13;
    Hellberg). It has recently been amended by the necessity to have the condition &#13;
    of the watertight doors examined, which certainly had influenced the sinking &#13;
    speed! We have read your interview in Dagens Nyheter in this respect and might &#13;
    remark that the control light arrangement for the WT doors on the bridge must &#13;
    have been changed after the vessel was renamed "Estonia", because as long &#13;
    as she was sailing under Finnish flag the lights were "green" when the doors &#13;
    were "open" (which was the normal situation) and "red" when the doors were &#13;
    "closed". To sum it up, in our opinion, it is mandatory to have the accessible &#13;
    objects brought up and to examine the other items on site respectively tape &#13;
    them on video. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"><b>IV. The book "Katastrofen Kurs" by Anders Jörle and Anders &#13;
    Hellberg </b><br/>&#13;
    We have read this book with great interest. We gather therefrom that it is &#13;
    now public and undisputed knowledge in Sweden that the ramp was untight and &#13;
    that the technical managers and part owners of the vessel knew this positively. &#13;
    After they had allowed the visor to become untight they also allowed the vessel &#13;
    to sail with the only forward closure of the cardeck being untight as well. &#13;
    As will be shown later this is the root of the catastrophe. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2"><b>V.</b> Finally, we would like to bring to your attention &#13;
    further investigation results in addition to those reported to you already &#13;
    in our previous letters. These are: </font></p>&#13;

      1.1. Hinge plates Examination of the remains of the visor hinge plates at &#13;
      KTH, Stockholm revealed a/o that - the starboard hinge plates have deep &#13;
      burning marks from which numerous cracks (fatigue) had started and penetrated &#13;
      the material to varying extent. - the port hinge plates have a smooth surface &#13;
      with slight indications of burning marks in some restricted areas only. &#13;
      - measurements of the closest distances between the vertical plates to which &#13;
      the hinge plates are welded and the hinge plates revealed that this distance &#13;
      is 10-12 mm smaller at Starboard side compared to port side. This leads &#13;
      to the conclusion that the burning action has destroyed 10-12 mm of the &#13;
      hinge plate material of the Starboard hinges which, however, remained at &#13;
      the port side hinge plates. Consequently the visor was misaligned by the &#13;
      distance of 10-12 mm. Evidence: Report of Prof. Hoffmeister, Photos. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">1.2. Stempost The stempost was originally the strongest &#13;
      part of the visor - 200 mm wide and 60 mm thick - and formed the forward &#13;
      lower support, taking the major part of the design load of 55 ts, thereby &#13;
      resting on the upper extension of the ice-stem being the forward part of &#13;
      A-Deck, thus there was steel to steel contact. According to the initial &#13;
      design the stempost was supposed to carry at least 80% of the weight, whilst &#13;
      the 2 compression bars fitted on A-Deck and the (intact) rubber packings &#13;
      took the remaining weight. Due to this distribution the bottom of the visor &#13;
      was pressed into the rubber packings some 8-10 mm - as long as they were &#13;
      in place - thereby assuring watertightness. Between the top of pyramid on &#13;
      A-Deck and the pocket into which it fitted there was a design play of 50 &#13;
      mm, to the side just of 3 mm. As long as the visor had its original shape &#13;
      and geometry there was not steel to steel contact between the inside of &#13;
      pocket/pyramid nor between bottom of visor/A-Deck. Upon investigation in &#13;
      Hangö it was noted that the stempost was broken practically in 4 parts the &#13;
      lowest of which had disappeared well before the casualty, leaving a gap &#13;
      in the bottom of the visor. Due to the missing part of the stempost as well &#13;
      as the cracks sustained therein the stempost could no longer carry the main &#13;
      weight of the visor which was now taken up by the pyramid/pocket and the &#13;
      forepart of the visor bottom, which in turn led to cracks in the welding &#13;
      seams already some time before the casualty. Furthermore, the changed weight &#13;
      distribution caused additional stress on hinges and locking devices and &#13;
      added to the misalignment of the visor as a whole.<i><b> <br/>&#13;
      Evidence:</b></i> Report Prof. Hoffmeister, Photos. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">1.3. Missing rubber packings It is evident from the underwater &#13;
      videos and demonstrated by several photos that the rubber packings on A-Deck &#13;
      were either missing or damaged with very few exceptions, whilst the flat &#13;
      bar and holding bolts, between which the rubber packings were fitted, are &#13;
      obviously undamaged and in place. The same refers to the holding bolts fitted &#13;
      by the crew when the vessel was still "Viking Sally". Consequently, there &#13;
      was nothing to prevent seawater from entering the visor inside once the &#13;
      outboard level was rising above A-Deck. The rubber packings were not just &#13;
      gone on the A-Deck but also in the most crucial areas in front of the 2 &#13;
      bulkheads at both sides of the ramp opening, i.e. of the vessel, where they &#13;
      are missing about 2 m upwards of the bulkheads. This is exactly the area &#13;
      where they are most required, i.e. on A-Deck in front and about 1 m up the &#13;
      bulkheads, because intact rubber packings, in particular in the above-mentioned &#13;
      locations, not only seal the visor inside against water ingress but are &#13;
      also a relevant part of the visor's closing system, because only the counter &#13;
      pressure of intact rubber packings against the closed locking devices assures &#13;
      a firm connection between visor/vessel and prevents vibration of the visor &#13;
      at sea. The lack of rubber packings in most relevant areas did not permit &#13;
      this firm connection between visor and vessel and the visor therefore vibrated &#13;
      within the existing play, which created the 'banging noises' heard by many &#13;

      say that these movements of the visor created undue further stress on the &#13;
      locking and holding devices. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">1.4. Old Damages There are 2 severe damages having existed &#13;
      before the casualty, viz. - in front of the visor between bottom and up &#13;
      the 2nd stringer level, and - in way of the 3rd stringer port side, which &#13;
      is bent upwards with bent and buckled frames/brackets. These damages have &#13;
      doubtlessly affected the geometry of the visor and led - in addition to &#13;
      all the other explained circumstances - to additional misalignment. Details &#13;
      have been explained in previous letters. <i><b><br/>&#13;

      capacity reduced respectively. The starboard lug with the support bracket &#13;

      a mok-up was built by Meyer Werft with original dimensions, except for the &#13;

      found at the lugs recovered from the vessel (original 7-8 mm) - upon request &#13;
      of Klaus Rahka/VTT. The breaking test performed by the Institut für Schiffbau &#13;
      of the University, Hamburg - Professor Petershagen - in the presence of &#13;
      Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka/VTT-Helsinki revealed that the visor lug &#13;
      broke at a load of 210 ts. Subsequent examination by Prof. Hoffmeister revealed &#13;
      that the bolt (ST 52 steel) was slightly bent, that Starboard and centre &#13;
      lugs were slightly bent apart but the welding seams - although just 3 mm &#13;
      - showed no cracks at all. <i><b><br/>&#13;

      These additional securings - called "heavy weather securings" by Bureau &#13;
      Veritas - were not - as we all know - engaged. We are aware of the statement &#13;
      of Ulf Hobro at our first joint meeting on 16.2.95, namely that these locks &#13;
      were only engaged when other parts, e.g. the hydraulic cylinders, would &#13;
      be repaired in port. Therefore it might be helpful to draw your attention &#13;
      to the statement of the 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür taken on 3.10.94 by the &#13;
      Tallinn police, in which he testifies that he was the responsible engineer &#13;
      for watertight doors and the hydraulic arrangements of the visor. He further &#13;
      stated that the visor has 5 fixing points and that there were 2 manual bolts &#13;
      which the boatswain has to engage. Evidently Peeter Tüür knew that these &#13;
      bolts had to be engaged, thus it follows logic to assume that at least the &#13;
      nautical offiers and the boatswain - if not the technical inspector - knew &#13;
      it. <br/><i><b>Evidence:</b></i> Statement of Peeter Tüür taken on 3.10.94 by Tallinn &#13;

    <p><font size="2">(a) Examination of the recovered steel bushing with part &#13;
      of the visor hinge plate still attached to it revealed a/o that - the gap &#13;
      between bushing and hinge plate is some cm wide; - the material accumulated &#13;
      at one side and extending into the gap is apparently welding material; - &#13;
      in the remains of the welding seams between bushing/visor hinge plate small &#13;
      burning marks can be seen. This leads to the conclusion that the gap must &#13;
      have existed prior to the casualty as otherwise the material could not have &#13;
      gotten into it. <br/>&#13;
      (b) A video film made a couple of days before the casualty by a passenger &#13;
      shows the Starboard hinge in detail. It is obvious that - there is a wide &#13;
      gap between the outer hinge plates of vessel/visor in a location where normally &#13;
      the inner part of the steel bushing and the distance ring should be; - the &#13;
      outer securing plate is missing, although 3 bolts can be seen sticking out &#13;
      of the bushing; - the outer part of the bushing appears to be disproportionately &#13;
      large; - the lower part of the bushing at the outer side appears to be missing &#13;
      completely. <i><b>Note</b></i>: The relevant part of the video film will &#13;
      be analysed by a professional analyst and the result will be submitted to &#13;
      you in due course. <br/>&#13;
      (d) Examination of the remains of the 4 visor hinge plates at KTH, Stockholm &#13;
      revealed a/o that - the 2 Starboard and the inner port hinge plates are &#13;
      straight; - the lower part of the port outer hinge plate is bent to port &#13;
      . According to Prof. Hoffmeister this leads to the conclusion that the port &#13;
      outer hinge broke last when the visor was in a position to the port side &#13;
      of the centre line of the vessel. <br/><i><b>Evidence</b></i>: Report of Prof. Hoffmeister Report of Brian Roberts &#13;

    <p><font size="2"> After the failure of the hinges the visor moved forward &#13;
      and the lugs underneath the visor arms were cutting through the 8 mm deck &#13;
      plating, but only for 120 mm, then they hit the rather strong transverse &#13;
      deck-beam. According to the estimate of metallurgists it took any time up &#13;
      to 10 minutes for the lugs to cut through this strong beam. The condition &#13;
      can best be demonstrated by the photo below showing the void space on B-Deck &#13;

      When the lugs were working their way through deck and deck beam whilst the &#13;

      lugs. Assuming that the vessel was still in an upright condition - which &#13;
      is part of your scenario - these scoring marks would be more or less of &#13;
      similar intensity at the outer as well as at the inner lug plates. This, &#13;

      of the starboard lug - practically the counterpart of the severely scored &#13;

      starboard side, though apparently not as heavy as at the port lug inner &#13;
      side. The cut area through the green painted forecastle deck is clearly &#13;
      visible and straight as if drawn with a ruler.</font></p>&#13;

    <p align="left"><font size="2">The above pictures lead to the following conclusions:</font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> - The scorings at the lugs can only have been &#13;
      caused when the lugs were cutting through deck/deck beams.<br/>&#13;
      - Contact between lugs and deck/deck beams is only possible after the hinges &#13;
      have failed.<br/>&#13;
      - The much deeper scorings at the port inner side respectively starboard &#13;
      outer side compared to the port outer side and the starboard inner side &#13;
      indicate severe pressure from port to starboard. <br/>&#13;
      - This leads to the conclusion that the vessel listed already to starboard &#13;
      when the hinges broke and the lugs commenced their cutting work.<br/>&#13;
      - Since it took some 10 mintues for the lugs to cut through the deck beam &#13;
      and thereafter another 360 mm of deck plating had to be cut before the aft &#13;
      side of the ramp-house could have come into contact with the ramp, however, &#13;
      there are only very minor scratches at the outer side of the port lug plate, &#13;
      it has to be concluded that the vessel must have already had a considerable &#13;
      starboard list while this cutting work was in progress.<br/>&#13;
      - Furthermore, bearing in mind that there had obviously only been sufficient &#13;
      contact between these frames (at port side of the inner ramp house in way &#13;
      of the first 4 frames) and the port side of the ramp to overcome the ca. &#13;
      40 ts holding power of the port ramp hook, the question arises what force &#13;
      opened the starboard ramp hook (if it had ever been closed), because the &#13;
      minor indentation and mainly only light scorings decreasing from port to &#13;
      starboard at the inside of the ramp house do demonstrate </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2">a.) that there was only very minor contact between the &#13;
        larger part of the upper ramp and the ramp-house between the 5th frame &#13;
        counting from port side and then decreasing to the starboard side, and<br/>&#13;
        b.) that the visor at the time of contact, i.e. when the port frames were &#13;
        bent and the starboard ones only scored, must have been in a condition &#13;
        shifted to port as it had already been when the last hinge plate, i.e. &#13;
        the port outer hinge plate, broke. </font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">- In other words, it can be concluded that when the ramp-house &#13;
      finally came into contact with the upper part of the ramp the vessel had &#13;
      had a very substantial starboard list for some time already and the visor &#13;
      had been in a condition shifted to port of vessel's centre line.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b>5. Inner Bulkheads </b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">The same as can be observed from the lugs underneath the &#13;
      visor arms is confirmed by the damage/scorings to the port inner bulkhead, &#13;
      whilst the opposite starboard side is completely untouched with absolutely &#13;
      no contact marks. The 2 pictures below show the inner side of the visor &#13;
      bulkhead with deep scorings/indentation and the holes partly torn. </font></p>&#13;
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><b><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/f.jpg" width="471" height="306"/></b></font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2">The ramp is at that stage already partly pushed open whilst &#13;
      the visor is resting in way of the obvious contact area on the ramp. The &#13;
      partly open ramp is thus preventing the visor from falling off to starboard. &#13;
      The sketch below shows the approximate situation at this particular moment. &#13;
      The foundation of the port actuator is still inside of the vessel's front &#13;
      bulkhead, although already broken loose from B-Deck. </font></p>&#13;

    <p align="left"><font size="2">Of course, the side view cannot demonstrate &#13;

    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>6. Conclusion </b></font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2">1-5 In summary of item A.1-5 the following &#13;
      further conclusions can be drawn:</font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> - The visor was also misaligned due to improper &#13;
      burning at the starboard hinge plates.<br/>&#13;
      - The stempost was severely damaged and had lost its main weight carrying &#13;
      function nearly totally. This led to additional misalignment of the visor &#13;
      in combination with additional stress on hinges/locking devices. The gap &#13;
      in the stempost area in connection with cracked welding seams has led to &#13;
      flooding of the visor inside up to outboard level.<br/>&#13;
      - The missing rubber packings had, in addition to the a/m gap in the stempost &#13;
      and cracked open welding seams, also resulted in a rapid flooding of the &#13;
      visor inside due to the so-called pumping effect.<br/>&#13;
      - The firm connection between visor/hull of vessel normally established &#13;
      by the combination rubber packings/visor weight/tension of locking devices &#13;
      was lost due to the missing rubber packings in relevant locations which &#13;
      led to movements of the visor at sea within the existing play and additional &#13;
      stress on hinges/locking devices. The movements of the visor created the &#13;
      low banging noises heard by passengers on previous voyages as well as on &#13;
      the casualty voyage.<br/>&#13;
      - At least the 2 most severe old damages in the visor had led to additional &#13;
      deformation and misalignment.<br/>&#13;
      - The Atlantic Lock arrangement at vessel's side was weakened due to improper &#13;
      repair and fatique cracks in the welds between lugs/ bushings of up to 90% &#13;
      of its initial load carrying capacity.<br/>&#13;
      - The 1st breaking test performed by the "Institut für Schiffbau", Hamburg &#13;
      revealed that the visor lug broke at 210 ts load whilst deformations of &#13;
      the bolt and the starboard and centre lugs were minor. The welds, however, &#13;
      showed no cracks at all, although just 3 mm strong. This leads to the following &#13;
      conclusions: </font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2">(a) The arrangement failed at 210 ts which &#13;
      is more than double the design load of 100 ts. <br/>&#13;
      (b) The arrangement at vessel's side with even weaker welds than having &#13;
      existed at the initially installed Atlantic Lock - withstood 210 ts, i.e. &#13;
      is able to carry more than 210 ts. <br/>&#13;
      (c) According to the damage picture found on "Estonia" the lugs at vessel's &#13;
      side broke, whilst the visor lug withstood, although stretched and bent. &#13;
      This leads to the conclusion that the Atlantic Lock arrangement at vessel's &#13;
      side must have been substantially weakened - as found by Prof. Hoffmeister &#13;
      - and thus failed at some load below 210 ts. <br/>&#13;
      (d) The Atlantic Lock arrangement which was installed on "Estonia" at the &#13;
      time of its failure can in no way be compared with what had been installed &#13;
      by Meyer Werft on the newbuilding "Viking Sally". Its load carrying capacity &#13;
      was substantially reduced.</font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2">(a) bushings/lugs at vessel's side without any welding connection &#13;
      at all = <i><b>result : 100 ts; </b></i><br/>&#13;
      (b) bushings/lugs at vessel's side connected with spot welds only (in order &#13;
      to simulate as closely as possible the condition existing at time of casualty) &#13;
      =<i><b> result : 142 ts;</b></i><br/>&#13;
      (c) bushing/lugs at vessel's side with 3 mm welds connected as found at &#13;

    <p><font size="2">As the breaking occurred with no <i><b>welds at all at 100 &#13;
      ts</b></i> and with<i><b> 3 mm welds at 220 ts</b></i> it can be concluded &#13;
      that <i><b>1 mm welding seams corresponds to a load carrying capacity of &#13;
      40 ts</b></i>, i.e. the initially installed lugs/bushing with 7-8 mm welds &#13;
      had an LCC of 7 x 40 ts = 280 ts + 100 ts = <i><b>380 ts</b></i>. Based &#13;
      on the test results of VTT, Helsinki the break-load of the starboard side &#13;
      lock was found to be <i><b>178 ts</b></i>, whilst the port one was found &#13;
      to be only<i><b> 131 ts. </b></i>In addition, the <i><b>2 manual sidelocks</b></i> &#13;
      would have produced about <i><b>50 ts each</b></i>, i.e. 100 ts. In summary &#13;
      it has to be concluded that at the time the vessel was delivered to her &#13;
      owners there was an LCC of in total<i><b> 789 ts~800 ts</b></i> available &#13;
      which fulfilled all requirements having then been in force.</font> </p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">- The manual side locks were not engaged, although they &#13;
      should have been according to 2nd Engineer Peeter Tüür and Bureau Veritas. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - The starboard visor hinges were substantially predamaged. This is not &#13;
      only demonstrated by the remaining parts available at KTH, Stockholm, but &#13;
      also by the video film made by a Swedish passenger a couple of days before &#13;
      the catastrophe.<br/>&#13;
      - The different damage pictures of the lug plates underneath the visor arms, &#13;
      i.e. the scratches/scorings at the inner and outer sides can only have been &#13;
      developed when those lug plates were cutting through deck-plating/deck-beams. &#13;
      Such cutting was only possible when the hinges were broken and the visor &#13;
      moved forward. The port outerside plate just shows some minor scratches &#13;
      whilst the port innerside plate is very deeply scored, indicating load from &#13;
      port to starboard. A similar picture is shown on the starboard lug plates &#13;
      where the outerside is much more deeply scored than the inner side. This &#13;
      is clear evidence that the visor's weight was lasting from port to starboard &#13;
      and this cannot be explained with the waves coming from port, because when &#13;
      the hinges broke wind/sea were already coming from straight ahead (statement &#13;
      V.Kikuts), whilst the vessel was turning further to port (statements Hillerström &#13;
      and Jonsson). The deep indentations/scorings at the port inner longitudinal &#13;
      bulkhead of the visor which were created when the visor was resting on the &#13;
      ramp, support this assumption as at the opposite side - the starboard inner &#13;
      longitudinal bulkhead - there is not even a scratch. There are more marks/indentations/ &#13;
      scorings and scratches pointing in the same direction, but the a/m should &#13;
      be enough for now. From the above it has to be concluded that the hinges &#13;
      broke when the vessel already had a considerable starboard list which triggered &#13;
      off the catastrophe sequence-of-events and must have been caused by something &#13;
      other than the bow ramp being pulled open by the visor. As will be explained &#13;
      in the following water entered the cardeck not only from the full visor &#13;
      through the damaged bow ramp, but also through the ventilation openings &#13;
      and subsequently through the scuppers with non-functioning non-return valves. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - At the time of the hinges breaking and contact between ramp/ramp-house &#13;
      the visor was in a condition shifted to port of vessel's centre line. </font></p>&#13;

      that got inside the ferry made it very unstable, and the wind and the size &#13;
      of the waves (according to the reports as high as 10 metres) were enough &#13;
      to push the ship to its side." <br/>&#13;
      (c) On 29.9.94 Reuter published the following: "The cause of the accident &#13;
      has not been determined. Henrik Sillaste, a surviving member of the crew, &#13;
      said he saw water pouring in through the bow gate shortly before the vessel &#13;
      capsized off the Finnish coast Wednesday morning. When the water was knee-high &#13;
      on the cardeck the engines stopped. The boat listed to its side and sank. &#13;
      Sillaste said he thought it was rain and wave water entering the ship because &#13;
      one of the two bow gates was not properly locked." </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">As the above statements were made only a few hours after &#13;
      the crew members had survived the catastrophe and were still under the impression &#13;
      of what they had gone through during that night, and as they were made totally &#13;
      without the later influence from shore people, these statements have to &#13;
      be considered true, no matter what the respective person might have stated &#13;
      subsequently. As a matter of fact, there is more evidence in respect of &#13;
      "the front gate was defective and had let in water" and "the gate of the &#13;
      cardeck was for some reason left slightly open and water came to the deck &#13;
      through it", because 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür stated on 3rd October 1994 &#13;
      to the Tallinn Police among other things, "... behind the visor there is &#13;
      the ramp. It shall also be hermetically tight! You find just a few spots &#13;
      where the ramp is not hermetically tight." Meant is certainly the gap or &#13;
      gaps created by the twisted port outer hinge with broken bearing which had &#13;
      been put by the crew repeatedly (your words) on repair lists, however, repairs &#13;
      of which were obviously deferred by the management possibly until the next &#13;
      scheduled time in shipyard. In the book "Katastrofen Kurs" Anders Hellberg &#13;
      and Anders Jörle mention in this respect on page 76, top a/o: ".. But let &#13;
      us first turn to the damage to the ramp which according to N&amp;T was taken &#13;
      up in the list of repairs to be carried out. Already here a fact is found &#13;
      which no normal classification society should accept: There was practically &#13;
      a damage to which in practice was the collision bulkhead of the vessel, &#13;
      but which was just put on the list for repairs to be carried out." As stated &#13;
      above this is obviously undisputed public knowledge in Sweden! </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b>7. Deformation / Misalignment / Non-Watertightness</b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"> <i><b>7.1</b></i>. Port outer hinge/bearing It has to be &#13;
      assumed that this hinge became twisted when the vessel had a list to starboard &#13;
      in excess of 2°, which was not adjusted before the loading or discharging &#13;
      of trucks commenced and the damage occurred when one or more heavy trucks &#13;
      drove over the ramp. This seems to be a risk well known to ferry operators. &#13;
      The hinge became twisted and the bearing broke, which was most probably &#13;
      only noted by the crew when the ramp could not be closed before departure &#13;
      because the port side had sunk down somewhat. To rectify this some piece &#13;
      of steel was hammered underneath the bearing to keep the ramp closest possible &#13;
      to its upper normal position. Obviously it was thereafter possible to open/close &#13;
      the ramp, however, some gaps remained, i.e. the bow ramp = upper extension &#13;
      of collision bulkhead above freeboard deck = was not watertight anymore, &#13;
      or to use the words of 2nd Engineer Peeter Tüür: "no more hermetically tight", &#13;
      because it was deformed and misaligned. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">The temporary repairs can best be seen from the photo below &#13;
      made from one of the underwater video films. The steel piece underneath &#13;
      the bearing can be clearly seen. The ramp was kept in approximately normal &#13;
      position as far as up/down is concerned, however the forward deformation &#13;
      could not be corrected by that. </font></p>&#13;
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/j.jpg" width="290" height="396"/></font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>7.2. Locking bolt </b><br/>&#13;
      In addition to the 2 hooks at the upper part of the ramp, there are at each &#13;
      side 2 hydraulically operated and conically shaped locking bolts which moved &#13;
      from vessel's side into pockets at the ramp side, thereby increasing the &#13;
      pressure of the ramp on the rubber packings. The 2 starboard bolts and the &#13;
      upper port bolts apparently still had been able to move into their mating &#13;
      pockets, because these pockets were found to be torn open after the casualty. &#13;
      The port lower bolt, however, could not move into its pocket due to the &#13;
      deformation of the ramp in forward direction.</font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> <b>7.3. Leakages / Gaps </b><br/>&#13;
      As a result of the above there were substantial leakages around the ramp &#13;
      to the large cardeck.<br/>&#13;
      - at the port lower corner about 1,5 m upwards and about 1,5 m athwartships; &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - at some locations at the opposite starboard side of the ramp. As at sea &#13;
      there was always water inside the visor up to the outboard level - the picture &#13;
      below shows the normal height - something had to be done to avoid major &#13;
      water ingress on the cardeck. </font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><font size="2">As the owners/technical managers were obviously &#13;
      not prepared to take the vessel out of service for the required time to &#13;
      permanently repair this damage and on the other hand major water ingress &#13;
      to the cardeck had to be avoided by all means, the crew sealed the existing &#13;
      leakages both from visor side - see picture below - but also from cardeck &#13;
      side. This was frequently observed by truck drivers and other passengers. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Note:</i></b> According to a previous crew member &#13;
        it was known to those responsible since March 1994 that there were substantial &#13;
        leakages in the bow ramp and that there was always some water on the cardeck. &#13;
        </font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">Needless to say that such method to secure watertightness &#13;
      of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead of a passenger vessel is &#13;
      unacceptable and totally useless against a water column of about 6 m in &#13;
      the visor </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b>7.4. Conclusion </b><br/>&#13;
      In summary of this Section B it has to be concluded that <br/>&#13;
      - the bow ramp - being part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
      - was damaged to such an extent that there were substantial gaps/leakages &#13;
      between the inside of the visor and the cardeck; <br/>&#13;
      - the port lower securing bolt could not engange its mating pocket at the &#13;
      rampside incl. the sensor for the indicator lights (in consequence neither &#13;
      on the bridge nor on the cardeck panel could be "green" indicating ramp &#13;
      closed and secured).<br/>&#13;
      - the cardeck was open to the water quantities inside the visor which would &#13;
      have been disastrous for the stability of the vessel already long before &#13;
      the catastrophe. To avoid this the crew plugged the leakages from visor &#13;
      as well as from cardeck side, which might have been partly successful during &#13;
      normal trading, but was ineffective against the pressure built up in the &#13;
      visor on the night of 27/28.9.94. </font></p>&#13;

      C. Cardeck / 1st Deck</b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><b><font size="2"> 8. Penetration of Water </font></b></p>&#13;
    <p><b><font size="2">8.1. Scuppers </font></b><font size="2"><br/>&#13;
      We assume that there had always been some water on the cardeck since March &#13;
      1994, the quantities of which certainly depended on the height of the water &#13;
      level inside the visor, which, in turn, depended on the sea condition. In &#13;
      other words, the worse the weather and seastate were, the higher the water &#13;
      level was inside the visor (and the more violent was the water movement &#13;
      inside the visor) and the heavier was the water pressure on the "seals" &#13;
      in the leakages, the more water penetrated these "seals" onto the cardeck. &#13;
      All this was well known to a number of crew members and the technical managers. &#13;
      In order to cope with the water on cardeck which, due to the more or less &#13;
      permanent stern trim, quickly ran to the aft part, some or all scuppers &#13;
      were constantly open. We assume that the remark made by Äke Sjöblom to a &#13;
      journalist when he was interviewed on the 28th September, 1994 about his &#13;
      findings onboard the "Estonia" on the 27th September, 1994 has to be understood &#13;
      in this respect. He said: "We went down to the cardeck and experienced a &#13;
      lack of respect for loadline matters, and when we say this and we discussed &#13;
      it with the Chief mate, we said we don't understand how come that this hatch &#13;
      cover is open here? It has always to be closed and it has not been closed &#13;
      for the last 1 or 2 years, and so on. I think it was in 2 or 3 places." &#13;
      In the subsequently drawn up "Report of Inspection in Accordance with the &#13;
      Memorandum of Understandiing on Port State Control" signed by him in Tallinn &#13;
      on 27th September, 1994 Äke Sjöblom has a/o noted:<br/>&#13;
      "1250 Covers on bulkhead deck to be closed."<br/>&#13;
      Convention reference: LL66, C II-1<br/>&#13;
      Action taken: 17 = to be rectified before departure" </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">You know certainly much more from him as you have no doubt &#13;
      spoken to him in detail. In any event he certainly does not know in what &#13;
      condition the scuppers and other openings on bulkhead deck = cardeck were, &#13;
      when the vessel departed from Tallinn. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">8.2. Lifts / Doors / Sills <br/>&#13;
      There are 4 lifts inside the centre casing with openings to the cardeck &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - in the forward part a person-lift which goes via 1st Deck down to 0-Deck &#13;
      (swimming pool/sauna);<br/>&#13;
      - in the middle part a person-lift which ends on 1st Deck. Both lifts have &#13;
      only 100 mm sills on cardeck level (the cardeck doors have 230 mm sills). &#13;
      In addition there are 2 big store lifts further aft down to the provision/ &#13;
      store area on the 1st Deck which have no sills at all (suitable for forklift). &#13;
      It is thus possible for water to run from the cardeck through the lift casings &#13;
      into 0-Deck (most forward lift) and straight into the 1st Deck (deck below &#13;
      cardeck) into the accommodation area as well as in the provision area. Whilst &#13;
      we have no evidence that there was water in way of the provision area (although &#13;
      we assume that there was), there is a lot of evidence that there was water &#13;
      in the accommodation area of the deck below cardeck and on the cardeck at &#13;
      a time when the bow ramp was still only slightly open, i.e. before the major &#13;
      starboard list commenced. The quotations below are part of the statements &#13;
      of passengers having been in cabins below the cardeck. These statements &#13;
      were taken by the criminal police soon after the rescue. </font></p>&#13;

      . - she was also hearing the noise of the stabilisers which held the vessel &#13;
      steady when she suddenly heard <i><b>a murmuring noise.</b></i> The noise, &#13;
      which she had not heard before, was low in its intensity. It appeared to &#13;
      her that the <i><b>murmuring sound came from above and it appeared to her &#13;
      as if water was running very slow</b></i><br/>&#13;
      - she looked at her watch; - this was at 24h00 (Swedish time); <br/>&#13;
      - a little later she heard a heavy sound above the cabin ceiling; <br/>&#13;
      - she got the impression that something large and heavy was moving from &#13;
      one point to the other; <br/>&#13;
      - after these heavy scraping noises the vessel took the first list;<br/>&#13;
      - Daniel jumped out of the cabin and shouted<i><b> that there was water &#13;
      in the alleyway; <br/>&#13;
      - she also saw that water trickled out on the floor before her cabin. </b></i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">All cabins are located on the 1st Deck at starboard side, &#13;
      i.e. the deck below cardeck, with the exception of cabin 1056 - which is &#13;
      located at port side but directly at the midship alleyway next to the 3rd &#13;
      stairway (from forward) leading down from the cardeck - all other cabins &#13;
      are located at the starboard side. In the same connection has to be seen &#13;
      the conversation between Security Officer Ervin Rhoden and an unknown man &#13;
      in Estonian language held in Södersjukhuset Hospital on 28.9.94, which was &#13;
      overheard by Paula Liikamaa (casino employee). Paula testified to the police: &#13;
      "The watchman whose 1st name is Ervin and surname is Rhoden said that he &#13;
      had switched on his walkie-talkie when he was in his cabin, when he heard &#13;
      another watchman - Silver Linde - say over his walkie-talkie that he was &#13;
      on the cardeck and that there was a lot of water on the cardeck and that &#13;
      they must leave the vessel." As Ervin Rhoden with absolute certainty did &#13;
      not listen to any walkie-talkie communication after 01h02 when the abrupt &#13;
      and severe port listing occurred it must have been before that time, i.e. &#13;
      this is another indication that Silver Linde was on cardeck before 01h00 &#13;
      when there was already a lot of water.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"> In summary of the above quoted extracts from statements &#13;
      taken by the criminal police of Finland, Sweden or Estonia shortly after &#13;
      the casualty it can be concluded with sufficient certainty that at the time &#13;
      when the vessel took the first major starboard list, there had already been &#13;
      so much water on the cardeck that <br/>&#13;
      (a) it was able to flow over the 100 mm sills of the person-lift, run down &#13;
      the casing to the 1st Deck, fill the deepening below the lift and fill part &#13;
      of the alleyways between the cabins at starboard side, partly already penetrating &#13;
      into the cabins;<br/>&#13;
      (b) it was able to flow over the 230 mm high sills of the cardeck doors &#13;
      and was rising inside the centre casing on cardeck level, simultaneously &#13;
      flowing down the stairs to the deck below (water curtain). </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">D. Summary of Observations made by Passengers and Crew on &#13;
      different Decks</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">In order to get as close as possible to the most probably &#13;
      sequence of events we have carefully analysed the statements of passengers &#13;
      and crew members made to the police shortly after their rescue. The various &#13;
      statements of Silver Linde have not been taken into account. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">Deck 8 : In the fore part were the accommodations of Master &#13;
      and Chief engineer as well as the owners cabin, which was occupied by one &#13;
      of the Stockholm pilots with his family. The Master and Chief engineer and &#13;
      the Stockholm pilot with his family are missing. In the aft part are some &#13;
      crew cabins and the day-rooms of officers and crew. After the first heavy &#13;
      list to starboard one crew member looked out of one of the windows at starboard &#13;
      side of the dayroom and saw "another ship in the sky ".<br/>&#13;
      Note: This must have been "Silja Europa" then already abeam. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">Deck 7 : This is the main accommodation deck for the crew &#13;
      with 4 cabins in front of the superstructure which were used as follows: &#13;
      (from starboard to port) <br/>&#13;
      1st cabin starboard side: Economy superintendent Jan Bergendahl (did not &#13;
      survive) <br/>&#13;
      2nd cabin starboard side: Technical superintendent Tomas Rasmusson (not &#13;
      onboard)<br/>&#13;
      3rd cabin starboard side: Chief mate Juhan Herma (did not survive)<br/>&#13;
      4th cabin starboard side: 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik (did not survive). </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">The windows of these cabins were overlooking the foreship &#13;
      and it has to be assumed with certainty that the Chief mate and the 1st &#13;
      Engineer did look out of their windows probably already after the first &#13;
      severe bangs at 00h45/50 and at that time apparently saw nothing, therefore &#13;
      it has to be assumed that the visor hinges and locking devices were not &#13;
      yet broken at that time and that the visor was still in place, because otherwise &#13;
      they would have alarmed the bridge already at that time and would have commenced &#13;
      action much earlier. Consequently the bangs heard at 00h45/50 must be connected &#13;
      to something different breaking, e.g. the bow ramp. About 10-15 minutes &#13;
      later, i.e. shortly before 01h00 or at 01h00, also the visor hinges and &#13;
      side locks broke and the visor moved forward/aft and somewhat up and down &#13;
      within the 120 mm space between the fore part of the actuator-lugs underneath &#13;
      the visor arms and the strong athwartships deck beam at frame 159. Each &#13;
      time the visor had moved forward a gap of 100-120 mm opened athwartships &#13;
      and water from the inside of the more or less full visor splashed out in &#13;
      cascades and subsequently surged in depending on the movements of the vessel. &#13;
      This was observed by Valter Kikuts, the deck passenger sitting with his &#13;
      friend behind the windows at port side in the stairway on 7th Deck, i.e. &#13;
      directly next to the cabin of 1st Eng. Arvo Tulvik and before the cabin &#13;
      of 2nd Eng. Peeter Tüür. Kikuts has stated to have seen this gap opening/closing &#13;
      already at 00h36 which appears to be impossible, 00h56 is the more likely &#13;
      time. In any event it was obviously seen by 1st Eng. Arvo Tulvik already &#13;
      before or immediately after the 1st heavy listing to starboard, i.e. at &#13;
      about 01h02. He had apparently left his cabin and walked aft when 2nd Eng. &#13;
      Peeter Tüür opened his cabin door and Arvo Tulvik said to Peeter Tüür: "Apparently &#13;
      the visor broke up, would be good if the vessel would be beached." This &#13;
      was also heard by the Reefer engineer Andres Verro, who left his cabin at &#13;
      the same time. Based on the apparent fact (see statement Mikael Öun and &#13;
      many others) that the 1st severe starboard list occurred at 01h02, Arvo &#13;
      Tulvik must have made his observation before that time, i.e. probably at &#13;
      some minutes before or at 01h00, as it is most unlikely that the 1st Engineer &#13;
      would have stayed in his cabin much longer than a couple of minutes (to &#13;
      phone the bridge knowing that they can see only the tip of the visor and &#13;
      his boss, the Chief engineer one deck above him, who as well as the master &#13;
      can see from their cabin windows nothing at all of the visor, finally to &#13;
      get dressed and leave the cabin). That's when he met Peeter Tüür and Andres &#13;
      Verro. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b>Consequently it has to be considered an established fact &#13;
      that the visor hinges and side locks broke at 01h00 or some minutes before. &#13;
      </b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2">Next relevant observations made / noises heard by crew-members &#13;
      and passengers shall be summarised as stated below: </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>2nd Eng. Peeter Tüür:</i></b><br/>&#13;
      - woke up by things moving around in his cabin<br/>&#13;
      - had heard before metallic bangs apparently caused by objects hitting against &#13;
      each other <br/>&#13;
      - thought the noises came from badly secured lifeboat or<i><b> that the &#13;
      visor had gone loose; </b></i><br/>&#13;
      - <i><b>felt that the speed was reduced </b></i>and that there was a starboard &#13;
      list of about 30°;<br/>&#13;
      - opened the cabin door and met the 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik who said: <b><i>"Apparently &#13;
      the visor broke up, would be good if the vessel would be beached." </i></b><br/><i><b>Note</b></i>: The cabin of 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik is on 7th Deck, &#13;
      port side, in front of the accommodation. From the window he can overlook &#13;
      the foreship with visor. The above remark from Arvo Tulvik was also heard &#13;
      by the Reefer Engineer Andres Verro (see his statement). <br/>&#13;
      - Next he heard "Mr. Skylight 1 and 2", which means according to Peeter &#13;
      Tüür's understanding: "Fire Alarm", the 2 fire-fighting teams had to go &#13;
      to their stations <br/>&#13;
      - he was No. 1 of team No. 1 and his station was on the 8th Deck - port &#13;
      side;<br/>&#13;
      - he went back to his cabin, picked up walkie-talkie and flashlight, left &#13;
      via window (due to the list) and went to Deck 8; <br/>&#13;
      - at that time he was confident that there was the risk that the vessel &#13;
      might sink; <br/>&#13;
      - heard on his walkie-talkie that the Information Desk tried to reach the &#13;
      bridge, but got no answer; <br/>&#13;
      - he tried it himself but also got no answer; <br/>&#13;
      - light went out but came back (auxiliary shut off and start of emergency &#13;
      generator); <br/>&#13;
      - after 4-5 minutes also this generator stopped - vessel on the side - and &#13;
      thereafter only emergency lights fed by batteries. <br/><i><b>Note:</b></i> This was 01h31. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Andres Verro </i></b>- Reefer Engineer - cabin 710 &#13;
      - 35 years. <br/>&#13;
      - was in cabin; <br/>&#13;
      - at ca. 01h00 was in bed reading a book when the vessel suddenly listed &#13;
      to starboard; <br/>&#13;
      - heard by radio "Mr. Skylight 1 and 2" which means actually "Fire Alarm" &#13;
      spoken by a male voice; <br/>&#13;
      - believes that he heard <i><b>before the list</b></i> some strange metallic &#13;
      sounds;<br/>&#13;
      - when he left his cabin he met the 1st and 2nd Engineers, one of them said: &#13;
      "Visor went away" (or something like that); <br/>&#13;
      - he got the impression <i><b>that possibly the fastening clips of the bow &#13;
      ramp had failed and through them water came in. </b></i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Aarne Koppel</i></b> at Turku - 29.9.94 - cabin 7011: &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - 5°-10° starboard list, felt it was an unnormal situation and woke up <br/>&#13;
      - heard a low breaking sound; <br/>&#13;
      - at 01h00 - when we got dressed - the vessel suddenly listed to ca. 30°; &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - when I was still in the cabin putting on warm clothes the light went out/on &#13;
      several times, that was when the main engines stopped;<br/>&#13;
      - it took ca. 5 minutes from the moment I woke up from the 5° list to my &#13;
      leaving the cabin through the window, which was at the high port side. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Elmer Siegel</i></b> - motorman - cabin 7007 - 43 &#13;

      - was in cabin on 7th Deck aft; <br/>&#13;
      - 3-5 minutes before list started heard noise<i><b> like somebody beating &#13;
      against vessel's hull with a large hammer which came from cardeck direction. &#13;
      </b></i></font></p>&#13;

      - when he came to the boat area on 7th Deck port side<i><b> Aulis Lee and &#13;
      Aarne Koppel were already there;</b></i> <br/>&#13;
      - people were streaming up to the 7th Deck through the open doors for another &#13;
      ca. 5 minutes, thereafter it was no longer possible due to the list and &#13;
      no one escaped anymore from the inside of the vessel. <br/><i><b>Note:</b></i> This means that already after ca. 01h15 it was no longer &#13;
      possible to get out of the inside of the accommodation. </font></p>&#13;
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Summary of observations made / noises heard &#13;
      on Deck 7 and 8 </font></b><font size="2"><br/><i><b> a) Before the starboard list: </b></i>1st Engineer saw visor moving &#13;
      / loose / broken up and various crew members heard metallic noises and as &#13;
      if somebody was beating with a large hammer against vessel's hull which &#13;
      came from cardeck. <br/><i><b>b) After the starboard list: </b></i><br/>&#13;
      - there was a vessel about abeam at starboard side<br/>&#13;
      - probably "Silja Europa"; <br/>&#13;
      - speed was reduced and subsequently the engines stopped after the list &#13;
      was 30° or more; <br/>&#13;
      - the Information Desk as well as 2nd Eng. Tüür tried to reach the bridge &#13;
      by walkie-talkie - ca. 01h10/01h12 - both got no reply; <br/>&#13;
      - already after ca. 01h15 it was no longer possible for anybody to get out &#13;
      of the vessel due to the excessive list. </font></p>&#13;
