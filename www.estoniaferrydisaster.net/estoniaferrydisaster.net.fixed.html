<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">MV ESTONIA left Tallinn &#13;
    with all four main engines running. When she was clear of the breakwater full &#13;
    service speed was set. The four engines were hence set to produce 90% of their &#13;
    maximum continuous rating of 17,600 kW, corresponding to a speed of 19.5-20.0 &#13;
    kn. The wind was southerly 8-10 m/s. Visibility was good, with occasional &#13;
    rain showers. </font> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 20.00 hours the &#13;
    watch on the bridge was taken over by the second officer Peeter Kannussaar &#13;
    and the third officer Andres Tammes. The voyage proceeded normally. Sea conditions &#13;
    along the Estonian coast were moderate, but became more rough when the ship &#13;
    left the sheltered waters. The ferry was now heeling between 2°- 4° to starboard &#13;
    due to increasing wind pressure on the port side. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the voyage continued &#13;
    the wind velocity increased gradually and the wind veered to south-west. Visibility &#13;
    was generally more than 10 nautical miles. At midnight the wind had increased &#13;
    to south-westerly 15-20 m/s with a corresponding increase of the wave height &#13;
    to now 3-4 m significant. The rolling and pitching of the vessel increased &#13;
    substantially. Many passengers became seasick, but everybody on board felt &#13;
    the extremely hard pitching which caused the ferry to shake and vibrate as &#13;
    she was driven through the rough sea with full power. Low banging noises from &#13;
    the bow area were continuously heard by many passengers. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">ESTONIA followed &#13;
    her normal route along the Estonian North coast on course 262° to a waypoint &#13;
    of 59°20' N; 22°00' E which is confirmed by the observations of survivor Anders &#13;
    Ericson, the watch mate of the meeting vessel AMBER and the trainee mate Einar &#13;
    Kukk having been on the bridge until ca. 00.35 hours.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the waypoint, &#13;
    at about 00.30 hours, the bridge ordered the engine room to activate the stabiliser &#13;
    fins, however, there were again problems with the starboard fin. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 00.45/50 &#13;
    hours one or two crashes/dull bangs were heard from the forward part of the &#13;
    car deck whereafter very hard metallic banging noises were heard and felt &#13;
    in the forepart of the ferry. Shortly afterwards it was felt that the speed &#13;
    had been reduced and the vessel was now making much softer pitch movements &#13;
    and also started to roll, less to port and more to starboard. Noises of the &#13;
    racing propellers were heard and respective vibrations felt.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time &#13;
    a first - weak - "Mayday" call from ESTONIA was heard by those on the bridge &#13;
    of a Swedish ferry in the vicinity, however, no action was initiated since &#13;
    the call apparently was not repeated. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 01.00 hours &#13;
    a sharp bang was heard and a slight shock felt, the vessel's hull vibrated. &#13;
    Passengers from the 1st deck started to rush upwards, others were alarmed. &#13;
    Water was noted escaping under pressure from 0-deck to 1st deck. A little &#13;
    later, the second and much heavier impact followed by the third one occurred. &#13;
    The vessel stopped abruptly while turning to port. At 01.02 hours the ferry &#13;
    heeled - very wide - probably 50° or more - to starboard and came back to &#13;
    almost upright condition whereafter she heeled again very wide to starboard &#13;
    and came back to about 10° starboard but then heeled in steps to starboard.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was now &#13;
    on a south-easterly heading with wind and sea from starboard abeam within &#13;
    a very short time and all 4 main engines were automatically shut off, while &#13;
    the auxiliary diesels kept running/generating electricity some time longer. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Passengers started &#13;
    to rush up the staircases and panic developed in many places. Many passengers &#13;
    were apparently trapped in their cabins where they were later found by the &#13;
    divers. Lifejackets were distributed to those passengers who managed to reach &#13;
    the boat deck. They jumped or were washed into the sea. Some managed to climb &#13;
    into liferafts which had been released from the vessel. Reportedly only the &#13;
    starboard lifeboats were launched but could not be used except for the emergency &#13;
    motor boat No. 1 which was later seen by some survivors proceeding away from &#13;
    those in the water. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a heel of approximately &#13;
    40° the diesel generators also automatically shut off and the emergency generator &#13;
    took over the power supply to a limited number of consumers including illumination &#13;
    of alleyways and decks, when a weak female voice was heard calling "Häire, &#13;
    häire, laevel on häire" the Estonian words for "Alarm, alarm, there is alarm &#13;
    on the ship" over the public address system. Just a moment later the internal &#13;
    alarm code for the crew - "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" meaning "Go to fire &#13;
    stations No. 1 and No. 2" - was transmitted over the public address system &#13;
    followed by the general lifeboat alarm. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first officially &#13;
    registered Mayday call from MV ESTONIA was received at 01.22 hours. A second &#13;
    Mayday call was transmitted shortly afterwards and by 01.24 hours fourteen &#13;
    ship- and shore-based radio stations, including the Maritime Rescue Coordination &#13;
    Centre (MRCC) in Turku, had received respectively automatically recorded the &#13;
    Mayday message. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The heeling to starboard &#13;
    increased stepwise further and water continued to enter the accommodation &#13;
    decks and the car deck through the partly open bow ramp and the starboard &#13;
    stern ramp with increasing speed. The starboard side of the ship was submerged &#13;
    at about 01.30 hours, with the visor still attached to bow ramp and forepeak &#13;
    deck. During the final stage of flooding the ferry was completely upside down. &#13;
    The visor fell off the ferry at a heel of approximately 130°/140° while the &#13;
    ship sank stern first and disappeared from the radar screens of ships in the &#13;
    area at about 01.53 hours. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Rescue efforts were &#13;
    initiated by the ferries in the vicinity while MRCC Turku reacted only rather &#13;
    late. About one hour after ESTONIA had sunk, the first of the four passenger &#13;
    ferries in the vicinity - M.V. MARIELLA - arrived on the scene of the casualty. &#13;
    Rescue helicopters were activated and the first one arrived at 03.05 hours. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the night &#13;
    and early morning, helicopters and assisting ships rescued the official number &#13;
    of 138 people, of whom one later died in hospital. During the day and on the &#13;
    two following days 92 bodies were recovered, thus it has to be assumed that &#13;
    most of the missing persons are still inside the wreck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The wreck was found &#13;
    in international waters within Finland's Search and Rescue Area, resting on &#13;
    the seabed at a water depth of about 80 m on a heading of 95° and with a starboard &#13;
    list of about 120°. The visor was missing and the bow ramp as well as the &#13;
    starboard stern ramp were found to be slightly open. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The position of the &#13;
    wreck was established to be 59°22,9' N, 21°41,9' E, while the visor was allegedly &#13;
    found on position 59°23,0' N, 21°39,4' E, i.e. about 1500 m to the West of &#13;
    the wreck. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <div align="left">&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The German 'Group &#13;
      of Experts' has now - as far as possible - completed its investigation of &#13;
      the foundering of the M. V. ESTONIA, a disaster that has taken the greatest &#13;
      toll of human life in the Baltic Sea in times of peace. The German 'Group &#13;
      of Experts' has during the past five years performed a difficult investigation &#13;
      in a partly hostile and reluctant environment. The work was carried out &#13;
      during the first two years - 1995/1996 - in close co-operation with the &#13;
      Swedish leader of the Technical Group of the Joint Accident Investigation &#13;
      Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden (JAIC), Börje Stenström ( February &#13;
      1997), and also with the Finnish member of the Technical Group, Dr. Tuomo &#13;
      Karppinen and the expert Dr. Klaus Rahka. All the investigation results &#13;
      of this 'Group of Experts' were submitted either verbally in joint meetings &#13;
      with the members and the experts from Estonia, Finland and Sweden attending &#13;
      or in letters with attached photos and/or video film documentation to the &#13;
      JAIC. This documentation and information concerned the design, construction &#13;
      and building of M. V. ESTONIA in general and the locking devices of the &#13;
      bow visor in particular, including the load calculations, the co-operation &#13;
      with the Classification Society Bureau Veritas, and the Owners. Furthermore, &#13;
      detailed evaluations of all survivors' statements, statements and other &#13;
      documentation such as photos and videos showing the condition of safety &#13;
      relevant parts of the ferry before the casualty obtained from previous passengers &#13;
      and crew members were submitted. In response, the JAIC submitted information &#13;
      and documentation, and up until the end of 1996 a relatively intense exchange &#13;
      of views and technical discussions took place which died away with Börje &#13;
      Stenström. A very detailed evaluation of the condition of the visor performed &#13;
      by metallurgical experts, of the objects recovered from the wreck or cut &#13;
      off from the visor, of the video films from the wreck made by ROVs and divers, &#13;
      of the testimony of shipyard employees having participated in the design, &#13;
      construction and building of VIKING SALLY, of previous passengers and crew &#13;
      members of the ferry as well as of survivors of the disaster form the backbone &#13;
      of this Investigation Report and are the basis for its conclusions. Breaking &#13;
      tests with mock-ups of the Atlantic lock were carried out by the Institute &#13;
      for Shipbuilding of the Hamburg University in co-operation with a member &#13;
      and an expert from the Finnish part of the JAIC. During the first half of &#13;
      1997 it became evident that the JAIC would not change its first technical &#13;
      findings and conclusions published in the so-called Part-Report in April &#13;
      1995 in spite of all the evidence submitted by this 'Group of Experts' and &#13;
      others which indicate a totally different chain of causation and sequence &#13;
      of events. Therefore it was decided to demonstrate the own investigation &#13;
      results to the Swedish public in two Exhibitions in the heart of the City &#13;
      of Stockholm, because it was Sweden who had paid the highest death toll &#13;
      in the disaster and consequently the Swedish public followed our investigations &#13;
      very closely. As from the Exhibitions - especially after the second - considerable &#13;
      support was received from Swedish citizens and further contact was made &#13;
      with a number of very important witnesses of fact. This Investigation Report &#13;
      covers all the evidence available to this 'Group of Experts' until 27.11.1999. &#13;
      Whenever considered relevant the attention of the reader will be drawn to &#13;
      the findings of the JAIC in comparison to the findings of this 'Group of &#13;
      Experts'. During the course of the investigation and, in particular, during &#13;
      the two exhibitions in Stockholm, many meetings with survivors and relatives &#13;
      of the casualty victims took place, which left deep impressions. Many of &#13;
      the relatives and survivors pleaded to assist them in the finding of the &#13;
      truth. This authors of this Report have attempted to comply with this plea.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i><b>In summary &#13;
      this investigation reveals that,</b></i></font></p>&#13;

  'The General Scandinavian Practice' </font></b></font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    has also looked into the origin of the so-called 'General Scandinavian Practice' &#13;
    which is meant to be the attitude of the Scandinavian National Maritime Administrations, &#13;
    in particular of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen &#13;
    respectively the Finnish Board of Navigation (F.B.N.), in respect of the interpretation &#13;
    of and the dealing with certain SOLAS Rules. This refers, in particular, to &#13;
    the location of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead &#13;
    deck, which on the car/passenger ferries is the car deck. This is regulated &#13;
    by SOLAS 1974, Chapter II-1, Rule 9 (1979 Edition) and exemptions are only &#13;
    possible according to Rule 1 (c) if the route of the vessel does not lead &#13;
    more than 20 nm from the nearest land. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the early years &#13;
    of the Ro-Ro ferries, i.e. end of the 1950's/beginning of the 1960's, the &#13;
    ferries were rather small and sailed only short distances and hence were never &#13;
    more than 20 nm off the nearest land. In this time the maritime administrations &#13;
    accepted the bow ramp in combination with the front bulkheads as the upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, no matter where they &#13;
    were located.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In searching for &#13;
    the origin of the authorities' attitude it was found that apparently for the &#13;
    first time on the ferries PRINS BERTIL and PRINSESSAN CHRISTINA, built in &#13;
    Aarhus in 1960/61, the bow ramps had been accepted as the upper extension &#13;
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck by the National Maritime Authorities, &#13;
    most probably with the restriction not to proceed more than 20 nm from the &#13;
    nearest land. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, it has &#13;
    to be noted that at least Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N. took the view already &#13;
    in 1959 that all structural matters - including the position of the upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead - would have to be dealt with by the Classification &#13;
    Societies, no matter whether SOLAS requirements, which actually were the responsibility &#13;
    of the Maritime Administrations, were involved or not. This attitude is revealed &#13;
    in a letter dated 07.04.59 written by the then Kungl. Sjöfartsstyrelsen now &#13;
    Sjöfartsverket (attached as Enclosure 2.2.3) and in a statement which H. Valkonen &#13;
    of the F.B.N. gave at a meeting with this 'Group of Experts' on 27.10.95 (Memo &#13;
    attached as Enclosure 2.2.4). In other words, as soon as the Classification &#13;
    Society had issued the Class Certificates the National Maritime Administration &#13;
    issued the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, thereby confirming that the &#13;
    ferry complied with SOLAS, although they did not know this for sure but merely &#13;
    assumed that the Classification Society had checked the compliance of the &#13;
    relevant vessel with SOLAS. This actually was the case only after the Classification &#13;
    Societies had incorporated SOLAS 1974 into their Rules, which, however, was &#13;
    not done simultaneously by all of them; for example Det norske Veritas (DnV) &#13;
    did it quite early while Bureau Veritas did it quite late. As most of the &#13;
    Swedish and Finnish ferries were classified by DnV, both Sjöfartsverket and &#13;
    F.B.N. were accustomed to having the Classification Societies take care of &#13;
    the structural SOLAS requirements. Bureau Veritas, however, incorporated SOLAS &#13;
    1974 into its Rules only in 1981, i.e. after DIANA II and VIKING SALLY had &#13;
    been built as will be explained in the subsequent chapters, and thus did not &#13;
    feel responsible for SOLAS matters during this time. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of &#13;
    the investigation it was also discovered that the F.B.N. had issued an 'Exemption &#13;
    Certificate' to VIKING SALLY for a deviation from the SOLAS requirements in &#13;
    respect of the lifesaving appliances, however not for the wrongly placed upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead, being the bow ramp on this as well as &#13;
    on most of the car/passenger ferries trading in the Baltic in those years. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Revealing in this &#13;
    context is the correspondence in 1981 between a Swedish ferry operator, being &#13;
    in the process of taking over a foreign flag ferry, subsequently renamed KRONPRINSESSAN &#13;
    VICTORIA, and Sjöfartsverket wherefrom the following is quoted:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Owners to Sjöfartsverket:<br/><i>«With reference to the previous exchange of communication we have noted &#13;
    that the bow ramp of this vessel is placed different than required by SOLAS &#13;
    1974. We are requesting you to check this and reply by return whether the &#13;
    location of the ramp is wrong.»</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) Reply by Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    to owners:<br/><i>«The location of the inner bow ramp is in conformity with the national &#13;
    as well as international practice and is accepted by us in the present condition. &#13;
    <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    vessel has the required Swedish and international certificate which is also &#13;
    accepted by Denmark and West Germany, whilst Sweden in the same manner is &#13;
    also accepting the certificates of these countries. It is not the intention &#13;
    of Sjöfartsverket to take up these questions with the Maritime Administrations &#13;
    of said countries.»</font></i></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Copies of the respective &#13;
    telex exchange can be found as Supplement 215 to the Final Report of the JAIC. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has &#13;
    to be assumed that in the course of the years and with ever growing ferries &#13;
    three alternatives concerning the bow ramp/upper extension of the collision &#13;
    bulkhead issue developed, viz.:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a) The bow ramp &#13;
    is the upper extension and is located in accordance with SOLAS requirements &#13;
    (the ferry could sail outside 20 nm range without restrictions). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b) The bow ramp is &#13;
    not the upper extension, but at the location on the car deck, as required &#13;
    by SOLAS, a "partial collision door" is installed (also this ferry could sail &#13;
    without restrictions). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c) The bow ramp (in &#13;
    combination with the front bulkheads) is the upper extension, but is not located &#13;
    at the proper place as required by SOLAS and no "partial collision door" is &#13;
    installed. (This ferry could sail inside the 20 nm range, but the National &#13;
    Maritime Administration would have to issue an 'Exemption Certificate' which &#13;
    would have to be renewed annually together with the PSSC.) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to a)<br/>&#13;
    This version complies fully with SOLAS and from this point of view creates &#13;
    no problems, however, the commercial side is treated badly because in order &#13;
    to take as many cars on the car deck as possible the bow ramp has to be as &#13;
    far forward as possible and this leads over to either version b.) or version &#13;
    c.).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> as to b)<br/>&#13;
    This version was already being built into ferries at the end of the 1970's &#13;
    operating in the Irish Sea, North Sea and the English Channel (although not &#13;
    on all of them). It complies fully with the respective SOLAS requirements. &#13;
    This version was also part of the initial quotations/specifications for DIANA &#13;
    II and VIKING SALLY submitted by Meyer Werft to the respective owners, whereafter &#13;
    - after consultations with Sjöfartsverket - respectively F.B.N. - the "partial &#13;
    collision doors" were deleted. The result was version c.). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to c)<br/>&#13;
    This version existed on DIANA II as well as on VIKING SALLY and on dozens &#13;
    of other ferries in the Baltic and elsewhere. The acceptance of this configuration &#13;
    by the National Maritime Administrations of Sweden and Finland, no matter &#13;
    whether the ferries sailed inside or outside of the 20-nm range and without &#13;
    issuing an Exemption Certificate to cover the wrong location of the upper &#13;
    extension is understood to be the 'General Scandinavian Practice'. It was &#13;
    followed for example by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket responsible for &#13;
    the DIANA II when she was sailing between Trelleborg and Rostock, still in &#13;
    1994 when the Manager - Åke Sjöblom - signed the PSSC thereby confirming that &#13;
    she fully complied with SOLAS, which she did not, because her bow ramp (with &#13;
    the front bulkheads) was the upper extension but as such located too much &#13;
    forward. As she stayed within the 20-nm range in the course of her route the &#13;
    simple issuance of an Exemption Certificate would have put the PSSC in compliance &#13;
    with SOLAS, however, it was not issued. The same refers to VIKING SALLY and &#13;
    SILJA STAR whereas the situation as to the WASA KING and ESTONIA was quite &#13;
    different, as will be explained in subsequent chapters.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this respect &#13;
    it is remarkable to note that the predecessor of the ESTONIA in the Stockholm-Tallinn &#13;
    service, the Swedish flag NORD ESTONIA, owned by Nordström &amp; Thulin, the technical &#13;
    managers and part-owners of the ESTONIA, had sailed between Stockholm and &#13;
    Tallinn for about 2 years under the strict supervision of Sjöfartsverket without &#13;
    having the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck at &#13;
    the location required by SOLAS and without having a "partial collision door" &#13;
    at the location required by SOLAS but with an unrestricted PSSC issued and &#13;
    annually renewed by Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of &#13;
    the explanations above it can be concluded that definitely in the years 1978/80 &#13;
    it corresponded to the state-of-the-art as well as to the 'rules of the art' &#13;
    that on car/passenger ferries operating in the Baltic Sea not more than 20 &#13;
    nm from the nearest land the watertight-built bow ramps were accepted as upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, and compliance with &#13;
    the SOLAS requirements was assumed even without the issuance of an Exemption &#13;
    Certificate. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 1979 - subsequent &#13;
    to the previously described series of 6 ferries - the DIANA II (Hull No. S &#13;
    592) was delivered to the Viking Line partner, AB Slite, Stockholm. Not only &#13;
    the tonnage of 11 700 GRT but also the fitments of this vessel demonstrate &#13;
    the speedy development of ferry-shipping in this part of the world, which &#13;
    became known as the 'Baltic phenomenon'. Both DIANA II and her near-sister, &#13;
    the following newbuilding from Meyer Werft VIKING SALLY, were products of &#13;
    the 'Baltic phenomenon' and considered to be trend setters for the ever growing &#13;
    'jumbo' ferries in this trading area. (See further Chapter 4.)</font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As far as could be &#13;
    ascertained DIANA II was designed by the Stockholm consulting office Simson &#13;
    Ship in close co-operation with AB Slite and Meyer Werft as an enlarged version &#13;
    of the predecessors APPOLO and DIANA. According to the newbuilding contract &#13;
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.5.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.3.1.5</a>) &#13;
    - written in German - Meyer Werft was inter alia obliged to build the vessel &#13;
    according to SOLAS 1974. Consequently, an upper extension of the collision &#13;
    bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck at the minimum distance from the forward &#13;
    perpendicular as required by SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 9, was imperative. &#13;
    Exemptions could be granted by the National Maritime Administration of the &#13;
    flag state - in this case the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - should the vessel operate &#13;
    exclusively in "sheltered waters", i.e. not more than 20 nm from the nearest &#13;
    land (SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 1 (C) ). The position of Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    in this respect has already been explained in this report in the preceding &#13;
    Chapter 2.2. It reveals that the bow ramp was accepted by the National Maritime &#13;
    Administration as the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead &#13;
    deck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers to &#13;
    Bureau Veritas according to the memo concerning a discussion in the BV-Hamburg &#13;
    office on 23 June 1978 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.6.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.3.1.6</a>). This office is responsible for the plan approval of vessels &#13;
    built in Germany to B.V. classification rules. In this memo it is stated under &#13;
    item 1: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The collision &#13;
    bulkhead has to be extended up to the C-deck by a watertight ramp. The location &#13;
    of the ramp as to the forward perpendicular can be determined by means of &#13;

    Maritime Administration.« </i> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the &#13;
    building files reveal that the Yard subsequently endeavoured to obtain this &#13;
    agreement directly from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket. This was basically done &#13;
    verbally in discussions and/or telephone conversations, which, however, were &#13;
    recorded in the diary of the Meyer Werft project manager H.Wahnes. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the above quoted &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">a) According to &#13;
      an agreement with Bureau Veritas and Sjöfartsverket the collision bulkhead &#13;
      was to be extended above bulkhead deck to C-deck by means of a watertight &#13;
      ramp, the location of which was to be determined by the geometrical mean &#13;
      in the obliquity (freeboard-deck = car deck = A-deck).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) In the &#13;

      that the bow ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
      above bulkhead deck, i.e. as such there was a deviation from the requirements &#13;
      of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In &#13;
    hindsight the cited documentation in respect of such an important deviation &#13;
    from the SOLAS 1974 requirements appears to be meagre. The following, however, &#13;
    has to be considered:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The Yard had &#13;
      already delivered 6 vessels of similar design to the same owners trading &#13;
      in the same service for which also DIANA II was built. Upon application &#13;
      of the owners to the National Maritime Administrations of the respective &#13;
      flag states these had issued - without problems - the 'Passenger Ship Safety &#13;
      Certificates', thereby confirming that the vessels complied with 'SOLAS &#13;
      1974' requirements.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the &#13;
      same manner the National Maritime Administration had dealt with a large &#13;
      number of other car/passenger ferries in the Baltic. This was in conformity &#13;
      with the 'General Scandinavian Practice' described in the preceding Chapter &#13;
      2.2.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the &#13;
      'pre-computer age' it was uncommon to confirm every agreement in writing. &#13;
      Verbal agreements and handwritten notes or memos were accepted and honoured.</font></p>&#13;
    <p> </p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is the considered &#13;
    opinion of the members of this 'Group of Experts' that on basis of the above &#13;
    explained notes/memos in connection with own knowledge and experience the &#13;
    deviation from SOLAS 1974 in regard to the location of the upper extension &#13;
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck was approved by the competent &#13;
    Swedish Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket - already in the planning &#13;
    stage of the vessel in accordance with accepted customs.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After all, this &#13;
    is confirmed by the fact that the 'Sjöfartsverket' upon delivery of DIANA &#13;
    II issued to her owners the 'Passenger Ship Safety Certificate' (PSSC) and &#13;
    has, ever since, renewed it annually without a trading restriction and without &#13;
    issuing an Exemption Certificate. The PSSC valid at the time of the ESTONIA &#13;
    casualty was issued on 10.06.1994 by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket and &#13;
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..3.1.9.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure &#13;
    2.3.1.9.</a> The certificate was signed by chief inspector Åke Sjöblom who &#13;
    also inspected ESTONIA during her last afternoon in Tallinn (see Chapter 15). &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The locking devices &#13;
    of the visor and bow ramp were calculated by the subcontractor von Tell AB, &#13;
    Gothenburg and - most probably - also by the Yard. Although the von Tell archive &#13;
    in Gothenburg - subsequently taken over by Kvaerner Shipsequipment AB - contains &#13;
    considerable design and calculation material concerning DIANA II, the respective &#13;
    calculations relating to the locking devices of the visor and bow ramp are, &#13;
    however, missing. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.25.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.25.</a> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time when &#13;
    these calculations were made, i.e. in 1978, the B.V. Rules still did not contain &#13;
    any specific requirements for the dimensioning of the locking devices for &#13;
    visors of Ro-Ro vessels in general and also not for car/ passenger ferries &#13;
    in particular, and although B.V. classed Ro-Ro vessels had had a number of &#13;
    serious bow door incidents in previous years - see Chapter 33 - for example:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Swedish flag &#13;
    STENA SAILOR, commissioned only in 1973, broke the locking devices of her &#13;
    bow door already on 16.01.74 and called at a port of refuge. The subsequent &#13;
    investigation by Sjöfartsverket revealed that sister-vessels had had similar &#13;
    incidents before and that the locking devices were underdimensioned for the &#13;
    loads to be absorbed. Since Sjöfartsverket as well as the other maritime administrations &#13;
    of the Nordic countries were lacking technical staff and facilities to carry &#13;
    out load calculations themselves, this was delegated to a number of acknowledged &#13;
    Classification Societies, among them B.V., who had to do these calculations &#13;
    anyway, respectively had to check the calculations performed by the Yard and/or &#13;
    its subcontractor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sjöfartsverket informed &#13;
    B.V. about the results of the STENA SAILOR incident investigation, viz. that &#13;
    the locking devices of this less than one year old vessel had been too weak. &#13;
    B.V. replied at the end of July 1974 that it was their intention to increase &#13;
    the requirement for the locking devices of bow doors. Since Sjöfartsverket's &#13;
    internal system at that time did not contain a follow-up of such promises, &#13;
    it was apparently left to the respective class of a vessel, in this case B.V., &#13;
    to determine the strengthening of the locking devices and it was not cross-checked &#13;
    by Sjöfartsverket whether this had really been carried out (see Investigation &#13;
    Report of Magnus Sjöberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.3.116.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    6.3.116</a>).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was the situation &#13;
    in 1978 when DIANA II - including the locking devices of her bow visor - was &#13;
    designed and subsequently approved by B.V. </font></p>&#13;

    2.4.1.13</a>). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the Building Contract &#13;
    required the Yard to build the vessel in conformity with the requirements &#13;
    of SOLAS 1974 the initial set of drawings contained a "partial collision door" &#13;
    (upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck) &#13;
    at a location according to those requirements. Reference is made to part of &#13;
    a drawing dated 20.12.79 with the edges marked yellow at both longitudinal &#13;
    bulkheads where the "partial collision door" was planned to fit in at frame &#13;
    150 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.14.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    Enclosure 2.4.1.15</a> - shows what was actually built for the following reasons:</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already &#13;
    during the negotiations of the building contract agreement was reached concerning &#13;
    the function and location of the bow ramp. This is revealed in a telex sent &#13;
    on 30.08.79 by Peter Motikat of Meyer Werft to Alf Johansson of AB Sally - &#13;
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.16.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.1.16</a> - where it is stated under item 6:<br/><b><i>»6. Bow and stern ramp arrangements according to DIANA II.«</i></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Peter Motikat &#13;
    was negotiating the building contract on behalf of Meyer Werft, whilst Alf &#13;
    Johansson was negotiating on behalf of AB Sally, then owned by the Johansson &#13;
    family.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it was the intention &#13;
    to build the foreship of both vessels identically the location of the bow &#13;
    ramp and its relevance as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above &#13;
    bulkhead deck was consequently therewith established. This is revealed also &#13;
    from item 3123 of the specification, where it is stated: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow &#13;
      Ramp One watertight bow ramp with longitudinal stiffeners arranged to give &#13;
      a free opening of 5.5 m width and 5.0 m height. In lowered position, the &#13;
      bow ramp to reach minimum 1.5 m forward of bulbous bow's front. At the end &#13;
      of the ramp hinged flaps to be arranged. The bow ramp cannot be operated &#13;
      if the bow door is not in open position.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also during the negotiations &#13;
    with these owners the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead &#13;
    deck had been discussed. The yard management knew from the simultaneous negotiations &#13;
    concerning the conversion of VIKING 4 into EARL GRANVILLE (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.17.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.1.17</a>) that the English Maritime Authorities, DOT = Department of Trade, &#13;
    as well as Lloyd's Register demanded the installation of the upper extension &#13;
    of the collision bulkhead at the location required by SOLAS 1974 before the &#13;
    vessel was permitted to operate under English flag. During the conversion &#13;
    the upper extension was installed as "partial collision door" at the location &#13;
    required. Consequently Mr. Motikat informed Alf Johansson accordingly offering &#13;
    the installation of a similar "partial collision door" on VIKING SALLY and, &#13;
    as a matter of fact, the installation was included in the original quotation. &#13;
    Alf Johansson, however, stated to have the agreement of F.B.N. to comply also &#13;
    in the case of VIKING SALLY again with the 'General Scandinavian Practice', &#13;
    i.e. bow ramp = upper extension of collision bulkhead and no separate "partial &#13;
    collision door" required. Mr. Motikat insisted on having this agreement entered &#13;
    into the building specification, where it can be found under item 3123:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> &#13;
      »Partial Collision Door For the intended service not required by F.B.N.«</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    is therefore convinced that it had been the wish of owners, and was approved &#13;
    by the Classification Society as well as by the National Shipping Administration, &#13;
    F.B.N., already during the planning stage of the newbuilding that the bow &#13;
    ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead &#13;
    deck, although its location did not comply with the respective requirements &#13;
    of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection &#13;
    attention is drawn to the fact that the installation of a "partial collision &#13;
    door" had been included in the initial quotation with DM 45.000,--. This amount &#13;
    was subsequently credited to the owners as revealed by an entry in the 'More/Less' &#13;
    list of project manager H.Wahnes (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.18.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.1.18</a>). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: <br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the &#13;
    'More/Less' list all items differing from the quotation are listed for final &#13;
    discussion with the owners. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the position &#13;
    of the bow ramp of ESTONIA did not satisfy the SOLAS requirements for an upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead an exemption certificate should have been &#13;
    issued on the condition that the vessel in the course of its voyages did not &#13;
    proceed more than 20 nautical miles from the nearest land. This was the intention &#13;
    when the ferry was built and actually she sailed in "sheltered waters" with &#13;
    certainty for the first 101/2 years of her life. According to Germanischer &#13;
    Lloyd it was common practice in the early 1980's not to issue exemption certificates, &#13;
    but a respective remark was made in the PSSC. It was said to be only in 1985/86 &#13;
    that IMO required the issuance of exemption certificates in case the National &#13;
    Maritime Administration made use of the right given to them by Rule 1(c) respectively &#13;
    Regulation 1.4 preceding each SOLAS chapter, viz. to exempt owners from compulsory &#13;
    obligations in case the vessel did not proceed more than 20 nm from the nearest &#13;
    land in the course of her voyage, i.e. remained in "sheltered waters". Consequently &#13;
    from the point of view of the newbuilding yard, nothing more could be done.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    has also investigated the reasons why the location of the wheelhouse on VIKING &#13;
    SALLY is different in comparison to DIANA II. The General Arrangement Plan &#13;
    No. 5675/79 dated 05.09.79, and being part of the building contract, still &#13;
    shows the wheelhouse in the same location as on DIANA II, i.e. above the front &#13;
    of the superstructures. In the specification - also being part of the building &#13;
    contract, however it is already stated on page 4-16 under item 4513 - Wheelhouse &#13;
    and Chartroom - inter alia: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Yard investigates &#13;
    to arrange wheelhouse 11 m to stern.« Owners had thus already at an early &#13;
    stage considered having the bridge installed somewhat further aft. According &#13;
    to Mr. Bernard Meyer this, as well as the altered shape of the funnel, is &#13;
    to be attributed to the proposal of a Finnish architect who wanted to give &#13;
    the vessel a better silhouette with these changes. Against additional costs, &#13;
    Meyer Werft carried out both changes according to the wishes of the owners &#13;
    and with the approval of the class and the F.B.N. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the new location &#13;
    of the bridge it was no more possible to see the forecastle deck, i.e. the &#13;
    bow visor from the middle of the wheelhouse, the command centre of the vessel. &#13;
    Therefore at both sides in way of the connection between wheelhouse and closed &#13;
    wings one window was installed just above the floor of the wheelhouse. Through &#13;
    these windows the forward part of the visor was visible. In addition, at the &#13;
    top of the visor a flag pole was installed with a blue light fitted on top &#13;
    which was shining aft only. This flag pole with the blue light also acted &#13;
    as a steering aid for pilot, watch officer and helmsman. This installation &#13;
    cannot be found in the specification of the building contract as the decision &#13;
    to move the location of the bridge aft was made only after signing of the &#13;
    contract.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to &#13;
    the presence of the flag pole with aft-shining blue light on top, up-and-down &#13;
    movements of the visor would have been very well visible from the bridge in &#13;
    the darkness unless the light was defect. - See page 110. Upon inspection &#13;
    of the visor in Hangö the flag pole was found broken from the visor, but it &#13;
    is still connected to the visor by means of the cable and is hanging below &#13;
    its initial position underneath the visor. (Visor is resting on steel blocks &#13;
    in upside down position.)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The change &#13;
    of the bridge location was approved by the Classification Society as well &#13;
    as by the F.B.N., as can be seen from part of the drawing 1116 "Arrangement &#13;
    of Top Lanterns" - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.19.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.1.19</a> - which was approved by Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on 09.01.80. &#13;

    2.4.2.23</a> - telex von Tell AB, Gothenburg to BV-Hamburg dated 18.03.80) &#13;
    and finally approved. It has not been possible to establish with certainty &#13;
    whether the calculations made by the design office of the Yard were submitted &#13;
    also to B.V. for examination because these calculations were just carried &#13;
    out as a sort of internal control of what the subcontractor von Tell had calculated. &#13;
    This is part of the standard procedure at Meyer Werft. As there is no date &#13;
    on any of the 4 sheets of the Yard's calculations, it is unknown whether these &#13;
    calculations actually reflect the last stage.</font></p>&#13;

    a recent check of what is left in the old von Tell AB files has only revealed &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The von Tell detail &#13;
      drawings contain remarks about the welding seam thickness in general or &#13;
      in reference to particular parts to be welded. The Yard drawings do not &#13;
      contain such remarks as to the thickness of welding seams for the following &#13;
      reasons:</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Meyer Werft &#13;
      designers do not state the required thickness of welding seams individually &#13;
      on the respective drawings, but draw up a so-called "welding table" for &#13;
      each newbuilding. In this table the minimum thickness of welding seams for &#13;
      particular structural parts is stated. The table is approved by the Classification &#13;
      Society and available to all welders/foremen. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2.) In case &#13;
      the particular structural part to be welded does not fall under the categories &#13;
      listed in the welding table, the welder follows the Yard's general welding &#13;
      standard.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3.) The Yard's &#13;
      general welding standard requires for the welding of structural parts, accessible &#13;
      from both sides, a seam thickness of minimum fifty to seventy per cent of &#13;
      the thickness of the part to be welded. This assures that the structural &#13;
      part to be welded to another part is connected by welding seams with a thickness &#13;
      of at least 100% of its own cross-section. As to the welding seams connecting &#13;
      the bushings with the lugs of the Atlantic lock on the forepeak deck they &#13;
      were 7-8 mm thick on each side because the thickness of the lugs was 15 &#13;
      mm.</font></p>&#13;

      into the photo-electric scanner steering the cutting machine, which subsequently &#13;
      cut-out lugs for Atlantic lock, hinge plates and side locks, which thereafter &#13;
      were transported to the locksmith shop. Atlantic lock lugs were 15 mm and &#13;
      60 mm, side locks and hinge plates 60 mm. The parts of lugs and hinge plates &#13;
      subsequently to be welded to the vessel's structure were oversized.</font></p>&#13;

      supplied by von Tell was welded into the centre and port lugs, and another &#13;
      smaller bushing was welded into the starboard lug supported by a bracket. &#13;
      Both bushings were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both &#13;
      sides in accordance with Yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings &#13;
      whilst the lugs were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the &#13;
      von Tell representative G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he would &#13;
      never have accepted the 3 mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains &#13;
      of the Atlantic lugs after the casualty.</font></p>&#13;

      with the big visor lug.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Welding of &#13;
      the lugs and the supporting plates (also 15 mm) carrying the hydraulic cylinder &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the above &#13;
    it has to be concluded that the welds connecting the bushings with the lugs &#13;
    of the Atlantic lock were made full load-carrying joints by using appropriate &#13;
    manufacturing techniques, and that therefore the load carrying cross-section &#13;
    of this locking device did satisfy the applied design and was incorporated &#13;
    into the actual installation.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It furthermore has &#13;
    to be concluded that based on the above outlined evidence the ca. 3 mm welds &#13;
    visible on the remains of the Atlantic lugs do not originate from the Meyer &#13;
    Werft production and must have been laid at some later occasion.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As stated above, &#13;
    the order from Meyer Werft to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg is dated 27 September &#13;
    1979. As the relevant parts of the visor and bow ramp were meant to be identical &#13;
    to the DIANA II design, the first drawings were ready at an early stage and &#13;
    sent by von Tell AB, Gothenburg to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg and from there to &#13;
    the BV-Hamburg office for approval and to the Yard for subsequent production. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus the von Tell &#13;
    drawing 49111-330 - 'General Arrangement of Visor and Bow Ramp' - was already &#13;
    approved by B.V. on 5 November 1979, however, with the following remarks in &#13;
    red handwriting: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Arrangement of &#13;
    locking devices subject to the approval of the National Authorities." <br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(The other &#13;
    remarks will be dealt with in the following chapter.)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to this remark &#13;
    von Tell AB wrote to the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on the 14 December &#13;
    1979 informing them about the newbuilding and requesting details of the drawings &#13;
    to be submitted for approval. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.27.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.27.</a>) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">F.B.N. replied that &#13;
    they assumed that B.V. would examine the drawings of, among other things, &#13;
    the visor and bow ramp and that only in case the Classification Society should &#13;
    be in doubt about the interpretation of the SOLAS Convention details by F.B.N. &#13;
    should drawings be sent to their office. In such case the problem should be &#13;
    clearly defined.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not exactly &#13;
    known what von Tell AB did as a result of these comments from F.B.N. In any &#13;
    event, according to the F.B.N. there was no more correspondence in this respect &#13;
    in their files. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has, however, &#13;
    to be assumed that von Tell AB spoke thereafter to B.V. Hamburg, who apparently &#13;
    were prepared to do the approval of the locking devices as well as of the &#13;
    surrounding ship construction. This is confirmed by the exchange of communication &#13;

      the bolts to ST 90 the then necessary strengthening of lugs cannot be carried &#13;
      out. Your statement that the yard is using 20 mm instead of 60 mm lugs is &#13;
      not understandable. The yards states to use 60 mm lugs. In case the bolts &#13;
      should be changed to ST 90 the yard is afraid that the lugs will have to &#13;

    and it is indeed the question of what use such remarks are if they are made &#13;
    on drawings which are returned to the Yard only after the vessel has already &#13;
    left. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is slightly &#13;
    different with the von Tell drawing 49111-330 - General Arrangement of Bow &#13;
    Visor and Bow Ramp - which was approved already on 05.11.79 and subsequently &#13;
    returned to von Tell with the following remarks in red: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»1. Arrangement &#13;
      of locking devices and protection against shifting cargoes subject to the &#13;
      approval of the National Authorities. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2. &#13;
      Watertightness of the ramp and bow visor to Surveyor's satisfaction. <br/>&#13;
      3. Local reinforcement of the ship's structure in way of - locking devices &#13;
      - cylinders - hinges to Surveyor's satisfaction.<br/>&#13;
      4. High pressure flexible pipes must be approved by B.V.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V.'s explanation &#13;
    for these remarks in their letter of 10.01.95: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»By the remark &#13;
      concerning the National Authorities it was made clear that locking devices &#13;
      were considered as an item subject to the examination and approval of the &#13;
      Finnish Authorities issuing the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate of the &#13;
      vessel.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In order to obtain &#13;
    clarification how this was actually to be interpreted the official opinion &#13;
    of B.V. was requested via their Stockholm lawyer - Bengt-Åke Johnson - who &#13;
    has commented as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»With regard &#13;
      to the wording in German on the drawing 590/1103 to which you refer in your &#13;
      fax of 20 February 1995, I have learned that Bureau Veritas inserted the &#13;
      wording just to clarify that the approval of Bureau Veritas did only concern &#13;
      the parts of the construction that were covered by the rules of Bureau Veritas &#13;
      then applicable in 1979 and that Bureau Veritas made the remark on the drawings &#13;
      in order to remove doubts and to direct the attention of the shipyard and &#13;
      the Finnish authorities to the fact that the locking devices were to be &#13;
      considered and approved by the Finnish authorities. Accordingly, Bureau &#13;
      Veritas approved the drawings to the extent the arrangements were generally &#13;
      complying with the Bureau Veritas rules, but wanted to draw the attention &#13;
      of the shipyard and the Finnish authorities to the fact, that Bureau Veritas &#13;
      could not approve something, i.e. the locking devices, which were not specifically &#13;
      covered by Bureau Veritas' rules of 1979.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious &#13;
    by the remark quoted above in their letter to the JAIC of 10.01.95, as well &#13;
    as by the comments of Bengt-Åke Johnson, that B.V. wants to create the impression &#13;
    that the final approval of the locking devices is the responsibility of the &#13;
    National Maritime Administration, i.e. the F.B.N., because they issue the &#13;
    Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a result of this &#13;
    investigation it has to concluded that this is wrong because</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Rule 3 of &#13;
      the 1977 B.V. Rules requires, among others, that "Doors ... have to be firmly &#13;
      secured by use of cleats conventionally spaced or other similar devices." &#13;
      It reveals from the B.V. letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
      Enclosure 2.4.3.37</a> - that cleats = cleating = locking devices consequently &#13;
      the locking devices of the bow door = visor were part of the B.V. approval; &#13;
      <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) B.V. &#13;
      had anyway to carry out the approval even if it would have been the responsibility &#13;
      of the F.B.N., because it was a "structural matter" which B.V. had to carry &#13;
      out on behalf of F.B.N. due to the respective contract between the organisations. &#13;
      - See also Subchapter 2.4.4.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    above is confirmed by the acting of B.V. surveyor Lohmann as well as by the &#13;
    statement of the principal surveyor of the B.V. Stockholm office, Lars-Olof &#13;
    Ålander, according to which he felt responsible for the locking devices and &#13;
    sensors. - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.1.134.htm" target="_blank">See Enclosure &#13;
    9.1.134.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Futhermore the B.V. &#13;
    head office was asked to explain by what means, for example, could a plan &#13;
    approver make sure that a "door", i.e. bow visor, would be "firmly secured &#13;
    by use of cleats", i.e. locking devices, dimensioned as per drawing which &#13;
    he is asked to approve? The answer was that B.V. relied on the design office &#13;
    (von Tell AB) and the Yard, respectively their calculations, but made no own &#13;
    calculations. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that the &#13;
    relevant drawings were approved on basis of the von Tell AB calculations carried &#13;
    out according to the Lloyd's Register requirements, the result of which was &#13;
    submitted to BV-Hamburg by telex of 18.03.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.23</a>). The Yard carried out own calculations with about the same result. &#13;
    Consequently both the Yard and its subcontractor individually performed calculations, &#13;
    whilst B.V. and F.B.N. did not.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The B.V. head office &#13;
    was further asked by what means did the B.V. surveyor on site make sure that &#13;
    the Yard/von Tell installed locking devices according to the approved drawings. &#13;
    The answer: »By random inspections.«</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon request of &#13;
    the B.V. head office after the ESTONIA catastrophe the senior B.V. surveyor &#13;
    G.Lohmann wrote down the remarks made in his notebook during the newbuilding &#13;
    phase in relation to the bow visor (with English translation made by himself &#13;
    indicating what he would like to have noted) - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;

      have had by then was 49111-330 - "General Arrangement of Bow Visor and Bow &#13;
      Ramp" which shows details of the bow ramp hinges only. Actually it has to &#13;
      be assumed that the remark in the notebook: "Connection of bow visor to &#13;
      aft part" refers to connecting the visor to the vessel, i.e. fitting the &#13;
      hinges together which was done at about that time.</font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both surveyors - &#13;
    G.Lohmann and J.Drazenowic - were then the Oldenburg Field office of B.V..</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the signed statement &#13;
    of G.Lohmann made to this 'Group of Experts' has not been returned by B.V. &#13;
    and thus cannot be made an enclosure to this report, his career and involvement &#13;
    in Meyer Werft newbuildings including VIKING SALLY shall be outlined as follows: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Günther Lohmann was &#13;
    born in 1929 and started his professional career in 1944 as shipbuilding apprentice &#13;
    with HDW-Hamburg and stayed with this yard until 1956. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 01.05.1956 he &#13;
    started as consulting engineer with engineer H. Rössler VD at Oldenburg and &#13;
    carried out newbuilding inspection and superintendent work for various owners, &#13;
    also non-exclusive surveyor work for B.V. (expert adjoint N.E.) until end &#13;
    of December 1976. From 01.01.1977 he was senior surveyor and exclusive surveyor &#13;
    for B.V. in charge, i.e. responsible, for the Oldenburg office. His district &#13;
    extended from Cuxhaven to Bodenwerder and to the Dutch border, i.e. the Meyer &#13;
    Werft in Papenburg belonged to his area. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He remained in this &#13;
    position until the end of March 1994, whereafter he retired, however, was &#13;
    recommissioned shortly afterwards as a field surveyor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his capacity &#13;
    as senior surveyor of the BV-Oldenburg office he supervised to a varying extent &#13;
    the newbuildings APOLLO, DIANA, VIKING 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5, DIANA II, and VIKING SALLY &#13;
    on behalf of Bureau Veritas. Over the years he developed a very good relationship &#13;
    to the responsible people of the Meyer Werft. This included for example the &#13;
    work force who used to consult him whenever they had technical questions to &#13;
    make matters acceptable to class. He also had close contact with representatives &#13;
    of the National Authorities as well as owners' representatives who, as far &#13;
    as VIKING SALLY is concerned, were members of the Johansson family, Captain &#13;
    Brunström, and chief engineer Lars Karlsson.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> His main duties &#13;
    were to make sure that the vessels were built according to the approved drawings &#13;
    in relation to the rules and in accordance with sound workmanship.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In line with these &#13;
    activities he had also carefully inspected the construction of the bow visor &#13;
    of VIKING SALLY, its installation, fitting of hinges, and welding of bushings. &#13;
    Furthermore, he did attend the watertightness test before and during trials. &#13;
    He recalls having been in the inner side of the visor during trials out in &#13;
    the North Sea together with the von Tell representative, somebody from the &#13;
    owners and also from the Yard, when it was discovered at full speed that some &#13;
    water was leaking through the rubber packings. Consequently local adjustments &#13;
    of the rubber packings were considered necessary and were made after the return &#13;
    to Emden, whereafter a hose-test confirmed watertightness of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He has been shown &#13;
    various pictures of the visor hinges with severe burning marks as found after &#13;
    the casualty and confirmed that what is visible on the pictures would never &#13;
    have been accepted by him, because it does not conform to the standard workmanship &#13;
    of the Meyer Werft, and further, is not in agreement with what he had seen. &#13;
    This also relates to the visor lug. The vessel would never have left the Yard &#13;
    in this condition.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He drew attention &#13;
    to the fact that at the same time when VIKING SALLY was under construction &#13;
    the yard was also building tanks for gas tankers which he also inspected on &#13;
    behalf of B.V., in particular the welding seams, where the requirements are &#13;
    very strict. Frequently the same welders were working on VIKING SALLY as well &#13;
    as on the gas tanks. Therefore, he was known to have the tendency to overstress &#13;
    his requirements as to the quality of welding seams in general. He was sometimes &#13;
    criticised for applying the same standard when checking the quality of the &#13;
    welding seams for gas tanks and normal vessels such as VIKING SALLY.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the Atlantic &#13;
    lock he stated the same as he did above in respect of the hinges: The welding &#13;
    seams visible on the pictures shown to him would never have been accepted &#13;
    by him, because they do not conform to the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft &#13;
    which he did survey.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary, senior &#13;
    surveyor G.Lohmann and his assistant J.Drazenowic did carry out the newbuilding &#13;
    supervision, apparently as required and as necessary in good co-operation &#13;
    with yard workers, F.B.N. inspectors, and subcontractors, e.g. G.Todsen and &#13;
    H.Brandt representing von Tell AG. Reportedly they made sure by random checking &#13;
    that the vessel was built in accordance with the approved drawings, the requirements &#13;
    of the rules and the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Yard, as well &#13;
    as von Tell, were sending 4 copies of each drawing to be approved to BV-Hamburg &#13;
    of which</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 was returned &#13;
      with approval<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent &#13;
      to head office Paris<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent &#13;
      to Oldenburg office <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was kept &#13;
      in Hamburg office </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the B.V. surveyors &#13;
    were at the yard practically every day where they had their own office they &#13;
    also received drawings directly from the yard before these drawings were received &#13;
    from BV-Hamburg with the approval stamp. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the fact that &#13;
    during the first weeks after contract signing it was generally assumed that &#13;
    the entire foreship area would be more or less identical to DIANA II lots &#13;
    of drawings were just copied and marked 590. This refers also to drawing 1106 &#13;
    - Interlock of Bow Visor - which shows the visor hinge construction on both &#13;
    sides of visor and vessel including the hinge plates. Also this drawing was &#13;
    taken over from DIANA II, consequently showed the hinge plate construction &#13;
    as installed on board this vessel, i.e. with 4 hinge plates each side on the &#13;
    vessel, each being 30 mm thick, i.e. in total 120 mm, with fixed bolts. (See &#13;
    attached photo showing DIANA II - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.40.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.40</a>) The drawing 1106 showing the above explained DIANA II construction &#13;
    was sent to BV-Hamburg for approval by letter of 07.11.79. Due to owners' &#13;
    wishes and with the consent of the B.V. surveyor, this hinge plate design &#13;
    was changed in December 1979 from 4 to 2 hinge plates of 60 mm thickness each, &#13;
    and the fixed bolts were changed to the floating-bolts system. In consequence &#13;
    the total thickness of 120 mm (initially 4 x 30 mm, subsequently 2 x 60 mm) &#13;
    remained unchanged (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.41.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.41</a>). Drawing 1106 and the respective detail drawings for production &#13;
    were changed on 02.01.80 as per <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.42.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.42. </a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The revised drawing &#13;
    1106 was sent by letter of 09.01.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.43.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.43</a>) to von Tell GmbH for approval and the same day to BV-Hamburg &#13;
    for approval (Enclosure 2.4.3.44). Moreover the drawing was also handed over &#13;
    to Lohmann at the yard. The drawing was returned by von Tell already by letter &#13;
    of 15.01.80 without comments, i.e. approved.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. returned the &#13;
    approved drawing 1106 only on 30.06.80 (approval date 20.06.80), but the approved &#13;
    drawing was the one sent on 07.11.79 for approval with the DIANA II version &#13;
    of hinge plates. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed &#13;
    that upon return of the approved drawing 1106 - at a time when the vessel &#13;
    had been fully accepted by the class, was delivered to owners and had left &#13;
    for the Baltic already - the yard just looked for the approval and put the &#13;
    drawing into the archive not noting that it was the wrong one which had been &#13;
    approved. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">What happened inside &#13;
    the B.V. organisation is unknown to this 'Group of Experts', however, it is &#13;
    a fact that the B.V. surveyors at the yard were provided with a continuous &#13;
    stream of new drawings simultaneously with the drawings being sent to BV-Hamburg &#13;
    or elsewhere. Therefore, this 'Group of Experts' concludes that senior surveyor &#13;
    G.Lohmann must have had drawing 1106 in the VIKING SALLY version, latest when &#13;
    he inspected the "connection of the visor to the vessel" on 28.03.80 according &#13;
    to his notebook (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.38</a>) because there can be no doubt that a senior surveyor with the &#13;
    experience of G.Lohmann would have noted at once that there were just 2 instead &#13;
    of 4 hinge plates at each of the hinges unless he was aware of the changes &#13;
    and had the corrected drawing at hand.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Further reference &#13;
    is made to the letter of B.V. of 10.01.95 to the JAIC (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    the Finnish Authorities, i.e. the F.B.N., because in their opinion the locking &#13;
    devices of the visors are not their responsibility, but have to be looked &#13;
    after by the Classification Society (which was confirmed by the retired principal &#13;

    B.V., that these manually operated fasteners were connected to limit switches, &#13;
    however, does not refer to the newbuilding condition when such switches were &#13;
    not installed. It has to be assumed that B.V. either mixed up the limit switch &#13;
    for the indication "visor closed", which is installed in way of the port manual &#13;
    securing device or the limit switches were installed subsequently, which is &#13;
    unlikely. Also the following statement of B.V. is partly wrong: </font></p>&#13;

      cleating was surveyable from a mimic panel (red and green lamps for each &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The overall cleating, &#13;
    i.e. locking devices, was surveyable only from a mimic panel with red and &#13;
    green lamps for each cleating group located in the control station (control &#13;
    panel) on car deck behind the bow ramp but not on the navi-gating bridge. &#13;
    The panel on the bridge just showed one red/ one green each for visor and &#13;
    bow ramp, i.e. the green lamp went on only when the visor was closed and secured, &#13;
    i.e. all respective limit switches had contact. The same refers to the bow &#13;
    ramp, i.e. the ramp had to be pulled tight against the rubber packings, and &#13;
    all 4 securing bolts had to fully engage the mating pockets and contact the &#13;
    sensors; only then would the green lamp indicate the bow ramp being closed &#13;

<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was built &#13;
    for the operation under Finnish flag and consequently had to comply with the &#13;
    regulations of the National Maritime Administration, then the Finnish Board &#13;
    of Navigation respectively Sjöfartsstyrelsen. Approval of all safety relevant &#13;
    installations on board a vessel, in particular if required by SOLAS, as well &#13;
    as the issuance of the respective certificates, in particular the Passenger &#13;
    Ship Safety Certificate, fell under the responsibility of this authority. &#13;
    SOLAS requires that the necessary surveys and inspections of ships to enforce &#13;
    the provisions of the present Regulations shall be carried out by the authorities &#13;
    of the country in which the ship is or will be registered. It is possible, &#13;
    however, that these duties may be delegated to surveyors or organisations &#13;
    recognised by the respective government which, nevertheless, remains responsible &#13;
    for the performance. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the light of this &#13;
    possibility to delegate and the development of the National Maritime Administrations &#13;
    of the Nordic countries after the war, i.e. also of the Finnish Board of Navigation &#13;
    (F.B.N.), it became an established practice that the respective Classification &#13;
    Society of a newbuilding designated for Finnish owners - in addition to their &#13;
    original duties as Classification Society - also carried out all structure &#13;
    related calculations and surveys and subsequently issued the respective certificates &#13;
    on behalf of the National Administration or supplied the data on the basis &#13;
    of which the Administration then issued the certificates. Such practice was, &#13;
    as such, followed by most Maritime Administrations in co-operation with the &#13;
    recognised classification societies. The co-operation is sometimes performed &#13;
    on basis of specific contracts, e.g. Estonian National Maritime Board/Bureau &#13;
    Veritas or just by a letter of confirmation from the National Administration &#13;
    to the Classification Society either in general or in relation to a particular &#13;
    vessel. With regard to the F.B.N., contracts do exist with the respective &#13;
    Classification Society regarding this co-operation, but these contracts are &#13;
    confidential.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the opinion of &#13;
    F.B.N. they were not responsible in 1979/80 and are still not responsible &#13;
    today for the calculation of load requirements of locking devices nor for &#13;
    the SOLAS-conform location of upper extensions of collision bulkheads above &#13;
    bulkhead deck. It is their understanding that this is the responsibility of &#13;
    the Classification Society because both examples are related to the structure &#13;
    of the vessel - which as such is true. Further, according to the F.B.N. it &#13;
    had been agreed already decades ago between the Governments of the North European &#13;
    countries that the recognised classification societies should look after all &#13;
    structure related matters on behalf of the Maritime Administrations as otherwise &#13;
    the Administrations would be forced to build up similar organisations with &#13;
    respective staff, computers, etc., which the classification societies have &#13;
    anyway, and both would have to be paid by the owners. This principal decision &#13;
    was laid down in the Copenhagen Convention 1924 and is - according to the &#13;
    F.B.N. - still applicable. Therefore, they relied on Bureau Veritas in 1979/80 &#13;
    to carry out the necessary considerations and calculations, also in respect &#13;
    of SOLAS requirements, in particular with regard to the locking devices (which &#13;
    is denied by Bureau Veritas). As proof that their interpretation is correct, &#13;
    F.B.N. refers to the MARIELLA casualty which occurred in 1985 in their waters, &#13;
    but they were neither informed by owners nor by the Classification Society &#13;
    DnV, nor by the hull underwriters. The VIKING SAGA casualty in 1984 never &#13;
    came to their knowledge until we told them, although also this was a Finnish &#13;
    ferry in Finnish waters.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> F.B.N. is convinced &#13;
    that their attitude is correct and that they basically just take care of lifeboat, &#13;
    fire-fighting, and navigational equipment, and leave the rest to the Classification &#13;
    Society. They have indicated that they have written and still write "Letters &#13;
    of Authorisation" to the Classification Societies whom they trust, e.g. to &#13;
    B.V. The last "Letter of Authorisation" is said to have been written to B.V. &#13;
    in 1982. Irrespective of the above, F.B.N. is aware of the fact that the ultimate &#13;
    responsibility for SOLAS matters, including failure of their servants, i.e. &#13;
    also class employees, rests with them. It should in this context however be &#13;
    observed, that also in the Copenhagen Convention it is explicitly stated, &#13;
    that the ultimate responsibility for the supervision of ships' safety matters &#13;
    always remains with the respective National administration. </font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious &#13;
    that the subjects of the discussion were exclusively F.B.N. requirements according &#13;
    to F.B.N.'s interpretation of SOLAS (SOLAS - Chapter 3 = Lifesaving Appliances, &#13;
    etc.). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition to the &#13;

    Bulletin No. 10/78 dated 23.10.78 containing the "Application for Approval &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The document furthermore &#13;

    not mentioned at all and upper extensions of collision bulkheads above bulkhead &#13;

    VIKING SALLY all three employees of the Technical Department of F.B.N. - Gunnar &#13;
    Edelmann, Pertti Haatainen and Jan Jansson - were frequently at the Yard. &#13;
    The time schedule for approval inspections by owners and/or B.V. or F.B.N. &#13;
    (then called F.S.S. = Finska Sjöfartsstyrelsen) from 28.05.-25.06.1980 the &#13;
    day the vessel left the Yard, is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.26.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.26 </a>and demonstrates what had to be approved by F.B.N. Thereby it &#13;
    has to be noted that some of the approval inspections which, according to &#13;
    SOLAS should have been performed by an F.B.N. inspector were carried out by &#13;
    B.V. surveyor Lohmann, who therefore had a double function. When visor and &#13;
    bow ramp were function tested on 19.06.1980, for example, he acted as Load &#13;
    Line surveyor on behalf of F.B.N. and as class surveyor for B.V. contrary &#13;
    to SOLAS but in line with standard/practice at the time.</font></p>&#13;

    - that the reply of F.B.N. demonstrated exactly the attitude during those &#13;
    years. He confirmed that at that time there were 3 men in the technical department, &#13;

    the required strength of locking devices, they had no means to do so at that &#13;
    time, it was part of the responsibility of the Classification Society and &#13;
    also of the Yard.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, it &#13;
    had to be assumed that due to the fact that the same procedure had been performed &#13;
    one year before with the, in this respect, identical DIANA II by the Swedish &#13;
    Sjöfartsverket, this may also have contributed in convincing F.B.N. that no &#13;
    activity of their own was required.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As far as the Yard &#13;
    is concerned it has to be assumed that von Tell had sent a copy to the Yard &#13;
    of the approved drawing 49111-330 - General Arrangement of bow visor and ramp &#13;
    - with the respective remarks: </font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the remark just &#13;
    referred to the "Arrangement", i.e. number and placing, and not to the "Dimensioning" &#13;
    of the locking devices and as further it was the intention to use an identical &#13;
    installation to that installed a year before on the near-sister vessel DIANA &#13;
    II, which had been approved by B.V. and Sjöfartsverket, there was no reason &#13;
    for the Yard to do anything, in particular, there was no reason to talk to &#13;
    F.B.N.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead there is apparently no correspondence &#13;
    between the Yard and F.B.N. This issue had been clarified beforehand between &#13;
    the owners and F.B.N., and it was confirmed by Director Valkonen that the &#13;
    bow ramp was considered to be the upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
    above bulkhead deck, although located too much forward. This was allegedly &#13;
    permissible according to SOLAS since the intended trade would allow the vessel &#13;
    to stay within 20 nm off the nearest land and under such conditions it was &#13;
    within the discretion of the Maritime Administration to exempt the owners &#13;
    from otherwise mandatory obligations. This however required the issuance of &#13;
    an exemption certificate by F.B.N., which apparently was not done and reportedly &#13;
    also not customary in those years (see page 84).</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>In summary: </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was agreed between &#13;
    the Yard and owners that »bow and stern ramps' arrangement same as on DIANA &#13;
    II« (see Enclosure 2.4.1.16), and further it was specifically stated in the &#13;
    specification, being part of the building contract, that </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»No &#13;
    partial collision door required for the intended trade by F.B.N.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the location &#13;
    of the bow ramp, being the upper extension of the collision bulkhead, was &#13;
    in line with the B.V. Rules and F.B.N. - having received all relevant drawings &#13;
    - did not raise objections either - there was thus no reason for the Yard &#13;
    to have doubts that this construction would not be in line with the SOLAS &#13;
    requirements for the intended trade. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After delivery, F.B.N. &#13;
    issued a temporary Passenger Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.55.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures &#13;
    2.4.4.55 </a>(Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.56.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.4.56</a> (English) - for the voyage from Papenburg to Mariehamn without &#13;
    passengers, which was valid until 20 July 1980.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the vessel &#13;
    came to Turku for the first time, the responsible F.B.N. Director H.Valkonen &#13;
    and the F.B.N. surveyor from Kotka, Gunnar Peippo, marked on a respective &#13;
    drawing all parts of the vessel not to be used by passengers and limited the &#13;
    number of passengers to 700. They further stated that the 20 nm limit was &#13;
    valid until the vessel was fully completed. At a subsequent meeting on 19.07.80 &#13;
    it was decided that the vessel was now completed and the first permanent PSSC &#13;
    was issued - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.57.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.4.57</a> (Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.58.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.4.58</a> (English) - however, restricted to "Kustfart mellan Finland och &#13;
    Sverige", i.e. "coastal trade between Finland and Sweden". </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The PSSC was issued &#13;
    in two different versions, i.e.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) in Finnish/Swedish &#13;
    language which was considered to be the original. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) in English &#13;
    language for foreigners.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The English &#13;
    wording is to be considered as a translation only.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the PSSC the &#13;
    F.B.N. confirmed the following:<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the vessel &#13;
    could be employed for "short international voyages" as defined in SOLAS 1974, &#13;
    Chapter 3 - Lifesaving Appliances, etc. Regulation 2 - Definition:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Short international &#13;
      voyage signifies an international voyage in the course of which a ship is &#13;
      not more than 200 miles from a port or place where the passengers and crew &#13;
      could be placed in safety, and which does not exceed 600 miles in length &#13;
      between the last port of call in the country where the voyage begins and &#13;
      the final port of destination.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the vessel complied &#13;
    with <i>»the requirements of the Regulations annexed to the said Convention &#13;
    as regards: 1. the structure ..«.</i><br/>&#13;
    - the vessel may carry 2000 passengers »i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige« &#13;
    which means translated: "in coastal trade between Finland and Sweden." Actually &#13;
    the respective (wrong) wording in the English certificates is: »For a short &#13;
    international voyage between Finland and Sweden«. This later led to considerable &#13;
    confusion because in particular the media only received the English version &#13;
    and interpreted the term "short international voyage" in this context as a &#13;
    reference to the SOLAS regulation cited above, which is wrong. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst<i> "short &#13;
    international voyage"</i> refers to SOLAS Chapter 3 "Lifesaving Appliances, &#13;
    etc.", the term "Kustfart" is a trading limit defined by the F.B.N. in their &#13;
    letter of 27 June 1995 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.4.59 </a>- as <i>"not south of Latitude 59°30'N"</i>, which again is wrong. &#13;
    The term <i>"Kustfart"</i> appears only in the Finnish <i>"Statute on Officers &#13;
    on Merchant Vessels 522/1964".</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This statute governs &#13;
    the number of and the competence of officers onboard merchant vessels. Under &#13;
    section 2 the types of vessels are defined as well as the trading areas for &#13;
    purposes of this statute. E.g. by the coastal trade/"kustfart" is, according &#13;
    to section 2, item 8 understood "trade outside the inner trading area on the &#13;
    Gulf of Finland as far as 23 degrees long, and on the Gulf of Bothnia and &#13;
    in the Baltic up to lat. 59 degrees 30 and trading within the Swedish Archipelago &#13;
    up to Söderköping". This statute comprises a number of general and specific &#13;
    rules (chapters 1 and 5), and also detailed rules on the certificates of engine &#13;
    and deck officers (chapters 2 and 3). Under chapter 4, the number of and the &#13;
    competence of deck officers is governed. E.g., under section 24 it is in very &#13;
    detail established what the number and competence of the deck officers onboard &#13;
    a vessel in coastal trade (kustfart) is. However, the statute does not refer &#13;
    to the vessel itself. The narrow scope of application of the statute is also &#13;
    described under section 40, which stipulates what pieces of legislation are &#13;
    cancelled by means of this new statute. Not a single statute referring to &#13;
    the construction, seaworthiness, equipment etc. of vessels is mentioned under &#13;
    that section. Consequently it has to be concluded that the definition "kustfart", &#13;
    "coastal trade" as mentioned in the PSSC is actually based on section 2, item &#13;
    8 of the "statute on ship's officers 522/1964" and that the explanation given &#13;
    by F.B.N. in its letter signed by Mr. Jukka Häkämies (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">enclosure &#13;
    2.4.4.59</a>) clearly refers to this same section, comprising the definition &#13;
    of "kustfart" "as not south of latitude N 59 deg. 30 min". A similar definition &#13;
    is not to be found in any other pieces of legislation pertaining to vessels &#13;
    or navigation, there is not even a reference to coastal trade in such legislation. &#13;
    This definition is not based on a possible exemption as per Chapter II, Regulation &#13;
    1 c) of the at the time with regard to Finnish vessels applicable SOLAS 1960 &#13;
    Convention.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is another &#13;
    matter that the F.B.N. later in the above letter, is alleging that the background &#13;
    of "kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" would somehow be the exemption rule &#13;
    of the SOLAS convention. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking &#13;
    upon the application of a definition comprised in various statutes, a general &#13;
    principle is that a certain definition is only applicable on matters regulated &#13;
    by a law comprising that specific definition. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly, the &#13;
    statute itself restricts the application of the definitions of that particular &#13;
    statute solely to the scope of application of the statue itself, that is on &#13;
    matters relating to number and competence of a vessel's officers. Therefore, &#13;
    the restricted trading area "kustfart", "coastal trade" has only been issued &#13;
    and it can only be used in matters relating to the number and competence of &#13;
    the officers onboard that is in connection with matters regulated by the statute &#13;
    of 1964. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The trading &#13;
    area "coastal trade between Sweden and Finland" (i kustfart mellan Sverige &#13;
    och Finland) has not been issued due to the construction of or particulars &#13;
    affecting the construction of the vessel but solely due to the composition &#13;
    of the crew, that is the restricted number of officers onboard. It only means &#13;
    that when the vessel is trading in coastal trade between Sweden and Finland &#13;
    - which it did - it has to be manned as per section 24 of the statute on ship's &#13;
    officers. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus, the restriction &#13;
    "coastal trade" does not relate to the construction of the vessel, however, &#13;
    if it is assumed that this particular restriction was intended to refer to &#13;
    the construction of the vessel, i.e. that the F.B.N. when issuing the certificate &#13;
    would have found that the vessel was only safe in coastal trade between Sweden &#13;
    and Finland, the conclusion would then be that the FBN should have made a &#13;
    respective remark in the PSSC which doubtless would have led to re-inspecting &#13;
    the vessel in case the trading area would be changed. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated in &#13;
    Subchapter 2.2 and as it has been confirmed by the SOLAS experts of Germanischer &#13;
    Lloyd it was common practice in those years for the National Maritime Authorities &#13;
    not to issue "Exemption Certificates", but that a respective handwritten remark &#13;
    by the inspector in the vessel's file was sufficient. In addition, however, &#13;
    this remark, that the trading area was restricted to "sheltered waters - 20 &#13;
    nm", should have been made in the PSSC as well, which could have been the &#13;
    case by the entry "i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige".<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It may thus &#13;
    be concluded that the F.B.N. issued the PSSC - after receipt of copies of &#13;
    the class certificates - in accordance with common practice in those years, &#13;
    i.e. it confirmed by the PSSC that the vessel complied with the SOLAS requirements, &#13;
    however, restricted the trade to "Kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" = "coastal &#13;
    trade between Finland and Sweden". This should have ended, however, when the &#13;
    issuance of "exemption certificates" became mandatory in 1985/86 and copies &#13;
    had to be sent to IMO. At the latest then the F.B.N. should have issued an &#13;
    "Exemption Certificate" in respect of the wrong location of the bow ramp as &#13;
    upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck (cardeck) and &#13;
    should have sent a copy to IMO in London as also required by SOLAS. This was &#13;
    not done. Even when the trading area was changed to the middle of the Gulf &#13;
    of Bothnia and the vessel's name was changed to WASA KING, the F.B.N. continued &#13;
    to issue the same PSSC's even though the vessel had left the "sheltered waters" &#13;
    on the leg Sundsvall-Vaasa when she was regularly more than 20 nm from the &#13;
    nearest land, thus the granting of exemptions was no more permissible according &#13;
    to SOLAS and the F.B.N. should have required the installation of a "partial &#13;
    collision door" or similar in way of the proper location required by SOLAS &#13;
    for the "the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck". &#13;
    Also this was not done and the vessel kept sailing in the same condition as &#13;
    delivered by her builders in 1980 and with the same worded PSSC as first issued &#13;
    in 1980. This was the situation when the vessel was sold in January 1993. &#13;

    together with Captain Brunström (who was replaced five weeks later by Lars &#13;
    Mäkki, the subsequent master of VIKING SALLY), 1st engineer Stig Strömberg &#13;
    and electrician Lars Sjögren. He had been in Papenburg already as owners' &#13;
    representative during the building of VIKING 3, 4 &amp; 5, thus knew the Yard &#13;
    as well as the people including the B.V. inspectors (all vessels were classed &#13;
    by B.V.), spoke some German and was therefore nominated as "coordinator" of &#13;
    owners' superintendents. He stayed until the delivery and subsequently became &#13;
    chief engineer on VIKING SALLY. Apart from the usual leave periods he remained &#13;
    in that position until 30.03.92. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following is &#13;
    an abstract of his statement concerning the building phase:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>«Three days &#13;
      after signing of the contract I came to Papenburg together with Capt. Brunström &#13;
      (was relieved after 5 weeks by Lars Mäkki), 1st engineer Stig Strömberg, &#13;
      and electrician Lars Sjögren. At the beginning I had only 1 small GA plan, &#13;
      deck and engine specifications were shown to me.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due &#13;
      to pressure of time we had to make a lot of compromises. In my opinion and &#13;
      experience the Meyer Werft was the only yard in Europe able to do such a &#13;
      job because of so little bureaucracy. This has, in my opinion, nothing to &#13;
      do with the catastrophe. Meyer Werft has very much experience. They have &#13;
      built all ships very strong, i.e. they were usually heavy. It is a well &#13;
      known fact that Meyer ships were stronger and behaved better in ice compared &#13;
      to e.g. Wärtsilä ships. <br/>&#13;
      With my team of supervisors I checked everything including, and in particular, &#13;
      weldings in close co-operation with B.V. surveyor Lohmann and his colleague. &#13;
      As far as I remember Lohmann was more active on VIKING 1-5, whilst on VIKING &#13;
      SALLY he was the boss and the other one did the routine work. Anyway Lohmann &#13;
      was always present when major items, such as ramp and visor, were presented &#13;
      by the yard and tested.<br/>&#13;
      My best contacts were Mr. Motikat and Mr. Wahnes. F.B.N representatives &#13;
      came from time to time, however, all paperwork was done by the Sally office &#13;
      in Mariehamn directly with F.B.N. Helsinki. I did some inspections with &#13;
      F.B.N. representatives in Papenburg, e.g.</font></i></p>&#13;
    <blockquote>&#13;
      <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - stairways, &#13;
        lifts;<br/>&#13;
        - boats, liferafts, etc.<br/>&#13;
        - fire doors, fire-fighting equipment, etc.</font></i></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Chief officer &#13;
      Lindström came about 3 months before delivery. I also inspected visor/ramp &#13;
      etc. I checked the visor during building together with the 1st engineer. &#13;
      It was very hectic during the last days before launching because there were &#13;
      delays in delivery of equipment from Sweden due to a strike in this country. &#13;
      After launching the visor was lifted ashore again. It was before only welded &#13;
      to the vessel by steel-bars. At present I do not remember details of the &#13;
      bearing/bushing system of visor hinges. <br/></font></i><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
      bow ramp was considered to be the collision bulkhead same as on all the &#13;
      predecessors built by Meyer Werft, but also the same as on e.g. TURELLA, &#13;
      ROSELLA, VIKING SONG, VIKING SAGA, and many other ferries.<br/></font></i><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On &#13;
      car deck there were 4 cameras installed, i.e. 1 forward to the forward ramp, &#13;
      2 at the sides and 1 looking aft to the stern ramp. The cameras could be &#13;
      moved and had also zoom ability. Monitors were on the bridge (located at &#13;
      port side of the entrance to the chart room) and in the engine control room &#13;
      (ECR) above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor &#13;
      could be changed to another camera either manually or automatically. The &#13;
      monitors on bridge and in ECR were showing the same picture. The main monitor &#13;
      with operating sticks was in the ECR, i.e. the bridge could not change to &#13;
      another camera.« </font></i></p>&#13;

    representative G.Todsen had supervised and controlled the Yard's work with &#13;
    parts delivered by von Tell and with parts fabricated by the Yard according &#13;
    to von Tell drawings. He also assisted whenever required. This refers in particular &#13;
    to the installation of safety relevant parts, such as the hinges, the locking &#13;
    devices, the lifting cylinders, and rubber packings. In detail the activities &#13;
    of G.Todsen have been explained in his statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.21</a>.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The installation &#13;
    of the visor hinges have been carried out - according to Todsen - as follows: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Installation of &#13;
      Hinges The bore holes for the bushings were made by means of a boring mill &#13;
      in the fabrication hall. I personally took a close look at the bore holes &#13;
      and touched them with my fingers before the bushings were installed and &#13;
      can confirm that by no means were they burned holes. I would never have &#13;
      accepted such dubbed work as can be seen on the photographs shown to me &#13;
      of the remnants of ESTONIA's hinge plate. In case the yard would not have &#13;
      taken notice of my objections, I would have left the ship and would have &#13;
      informed my principals accordingly.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Under my &#13;
      supervision on board the steel bushings were welded into the visor's arms &#13;
      and subsequently bored out to the extent that the bronze bushings did fit. &#13;
      These bores were carried out with extreme precision in order that port side &#13;
      and starboard side were in alignment in order to avoid breaking tension &#13;
      when opening resp. closing of the visor. Subsequently the bolts were guided &#13;
      in whilst simultaneously the distance rings (2 mm thickness) were fitted. &#13;
      I recall this work especially because it was rather fumbly work. The bolts &#13;
      were made of Nirosta steel and had a grease groove with grease nipple. By &#13;
      means of theses grease nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once &#13;
      a week by grease gun.«</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The Lifting &#13;
    Cylinders (actuators) were also supplied by von Tell and installed under the &#13;
    supervision and upon instructions of G.Todsen. Thereby the same care was applied &#13;
    as had been done with the installation of the hinges. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) The Atlantic &#13;
    Lock was also of von Tell design and mainly also supply. The Yard fabricated &#13;
    only the 3 steel lugs at vessel's side plus the visor lug and carried out &#13;
    the installation under the supervision of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. &#13;
    The von Tell supply can be taken in detail from drawing 49111-373 - Atlantic &#13;
    Lock - to be found in the "Drawing file". The yard performed as follows</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">:<br/>&#13;
    The lugs of the Atlantic lock were cut out according to the respective burning &#13;
    sketches in the 1:10 shop. The thickness of the 3 lugs to be welded to the &#13;
    forepeak deck were 15 mm each and the visor lug was 60 mm. The parts subsequently &#13;
    to be welded to vessel's structure were oversized. Thereafter the lugs were &#13;
    transported to the locksmith shop, where the holes were drilled into the lugs &#13;
    according to the relevant drawings and were subsequently transported to the &#13;
    welders shop. Here one support bushing was welded into the starboard lug, &#13;
    whilst the centre and port lugs were connected by another bushing, called &#13;
    "bolt housing" by the JAIC, which was welded into the holes of both lugs.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both bushings &#13;
    were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both sides in accordance &#13;
    with yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings whilst the lugs &#13;
    were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the von Tell representative &#13;
    G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he never would have accepted the 3 &#13;
    mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains of the Atlantic lugs. &#13;
    In this connection G.Todsen explains (see his Statement -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.4.2.21</a>):</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The three &#13;
      lugs, welded to the A-deck, as well as the lug at the aft part of the visor's &#13;
      bottom are yard-supply. The 3 first mentioned lugs had been constructed &#13;
      with overmeasure. It can be seen from the respective drawing that both bushings, &#13;
      the bolt, the cylinder including piston rod, and the limit switches (sensors) &#13;
      had been delivered by von Tell. The lug of the visor was welded and used &#13;
      as fixing point for the alignment of the other three lugs of the Atlantic &#13;
      lock. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At &#13;
      the workshop both bushings had been welded into the lugs in such a way that &#13;
      the large bushing fitted between the middle and the port lug and the small &#13;
      bushing into the starboard lug with the support bracket. As already mentioned &#13;
      above, I have had detail drawings for all components from which among others &#13;
      also the thickness of the welding seams were revealed.<br/>&#13;
      The installation of the Atlantic lock was carried out as follows when the &#13;
      visor was closed:<br/>&#13;
      - The fixing point was the lug of the visor, <br/>&#13;
      - accordingly hydraulic cylinder and the 3 lugs with already previously &#13;
      welded bushings were aligned, burned to fit and welded.<br/>&#13;
      Thereby I paid special attention to the even welding of the 3 lugs to the &#13;
      A-deck, i.e. inner and outer side the same. Furthermore, I took care that &#13;
      below each lug, in the void space under A-deck, a reinforcement was fitted.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) The Side Locks &#13;
    were of similar design and construction as the Atlantic Lock, with all components &#13;
    supplied by von Tell and the Yard only fabricating the steel parts and performing &#13;
    the installation under the supervision of von Tell. This was carried out as &#13;
    follows:<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was &#13;
    closed and the required length of the lugs measured, the lugs cut respectively. &#13;
    Location of lugs was marked at both bulkheads, the visor partly opened, and &#13;
    the lugs welded on to the bulkheads. Thereafter the cleats of the manual locks &#13;
    were also welded to the bulkheads. Flat bars welded at the inner side of the &#13;
    bulkheads according to class surveyor's requirements and under supervision &#13;
    and control of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) The Rubber Packings &#13;
    were installed on the forepeak deck to assure weathertightness of the visor &#13;
    and a firm and tight connection between visor and vessel once the locking &#13;
    devices were closed. By this tight connection high frequency vibration of &#13;
    the visor with respective effects on its fixing points were avoided. In this &#13;
    connection G.Todsen explains:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Prior to installing &#13;
      the 50 mm thick rubber gaskets every 300 - 400 mm the distance between the &#13;
      opposite parts visor/ship were measured by means of an inside calliper and &#13;
      the deviations ascertained were compensated by flat iron. This way guaranteed &#13;
      that the rubber gaskets installed afterwards had absolutely the same contact &#13;
      pressure, as the visor was pressed into the rubber gaskets up to 8-10 mm, &#13;
      which made the inside of the visor watertight (weathertight).<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During &#13;
      the trial trip to Helgoland, among other things also the visor was checked &#13;
      in respect of its tightness. The visor was totally locked, i.e. also the &#13;
      manual locking devices were closed.<br/>&#13;
      During full speed - i.e. about 2,5 m high bow wave and slightly pitching &#13;
      vessel - myself, Mr. Lohmann, surveyor of Bureau Veritas, and a representative &#13;
      of the owners, whose name I do not remember, were inside the visor and noted &#13;
      that the visor was not totally watertight, but at some places water was &#13;
      slightly leaking through. After returning to Emden the rubber packings were &#13;
      marked with chalk, the visor was closed and opened again. Due to the remaining &#13;
      imprints the leakings were found out and the rubber packings were raised &#13;
      in these particular areas. During a subsequent tightness test the visor &#13;
      was found to be tight and finally accepted by the owners, the Classification &#13;
      Society and the Finnish Board of Navigation.<br/>&#13;
      The official delivery took place already on 20 June 1980 - after successful &#13;
      function test on 19 June 1980. Afterwards the attached Delivery Certificate &#13;
      was filled in and signed by representatives of the owners, the B.V., the &#13;
      shipyard and my colleague Brandt.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. surveyor Lohmann &#13;
    also remembers that during trials some minor leakage was noted. He also remembers &#13;
    that after return to Emden the respective rubber packings were adjusted and &#13;
    a subsequent test revealed the visor to be watertight i.e. weathertight in &#13;
    SOLAS terminology.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (f) The Bow Ramp &#13;
    was also installed under the control and supervision and with the assistance &#13;
    of G.Todsen. His comments are:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The bow ramp &#13;
      as well had been installed and arranged under my supervision. The securing &#13;
      bolts were made to fit. During locking of the ramp at first each one hook &#13;
      on each side of the corresponding parts of the ramp lowered and pulled the &#13;
      ramp inwards, up until a special point had been reached and passed. Now &#13;
      the ramp was tight in position. Then two bolts on each side moved out of &#13;
      the ship into the corresponding pockets of the ramp.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
      bolts snapped audibly into their end positions. As from the control console &#13;
      on the car deck neither visor nor ramp locking devices could be seen, the &#13;
      operator had to rely on the control lamps and his sense of hearing. It was &#13;
      clearly audible by the snapping noises when the bolts engaged the pockets. &#13;
      Only after the bolts had fully engaged did the sensors become activated, &#13;
      which - if all bolts and also the hooks were in contact with the sensors &#13;
      - led to the "green light" at the control console as well as on the bridge, &#13;
      i.e. the ramp was closed and locked.« </font></i></p>&#13;

  The hull and deck arrangement</font></b> </font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hull was built &#13;
    to Bureau Veritas rules and to the Load Line and SOLAS Conventions regarding &#13;
    watertight subdivision. It was designed with a slender forebody extending &#13;
    into a bulbous bow and a "pram type" afterbody with two propellers and two &#13;
    rudders. Two bow thrusters were installed. The afterbody was modified during &#13;
    drydocking in 1985 by a "duck tail" extension giving increased buoyancy in &#13;
    the afterbody and a better hydrodynamic flow condition, preventing the stern &#13;
    from setting down at high speed. This was a problem in the original configuration &#13;
    unless forward located ballast tanks were filled.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The forebody had &#13;
    an extensive "flare", especially below the knuckle line at the car deck level. &#13;
    Such flares were increasingly applied at the time to provide full width of &#13;
    the car deck and accommodation area as far forward as possible.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An active roll-stabilising &#13;
    system with fins was installed in January 1994. Provisions for such installation &#13;
    had been made already at the newbuilding stage.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hull below the &#13;
    bulkhead deck was subdivided by fifteen watertight transverse bulkheads, equipped &#13;
    with watertight doors as required.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The double-bottom &#13;
    spaces were arranged for fuel oils and other liquids and some were designated &#13;
    as empty tanks. Fuel oil tanks were also placed above the inner bottom.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 0, the tank &#13;
    deck, contained : from forward - the forepeak, the bow thruster room, an extensive &#13;
    sauna and swimming pool area, and in the aft half of the ship - the generator &#13;
    room, the engine room, the fuel purifier room and other machinery-related &#13;
    spaces. The deck next above, deck 1, contained - in the forward half - economy &#13;
    class cabins for 358 passengers. The aft half of the deck contained the engine &#13;
    control room, workshop, main engine room and various utility spaces. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car deck was &#13;
    one open space, with the exception of a centre casing, located slightly to &#13;
    starboard. Loading ramps were arranged one at the forward end and two at the &#13;
    aft end of the deck. The centre casing contained staircases from the spaces &#13;
    below the car deck, lift trunks and various utility spaces for machinery and &#13;
    catering functions. Five lifts were installed, extending from the passenger &#13;
    spaces below the car deck and from the car deck to deck number 7. Six sets &#13;
    of stairs led from the lower passenger spaces to a common passageway inside &#13;
    the casing.Four sets of stairs led from this passageway to deck 4 and six &#13;
    sets led upwards to higher decks. Stairs were also arranged at the aft open-air &#13;
    deck spaces from deck 4 upwards to deck 8. Emergency escape trunks from the &#13;
    engine room area were arranged inside the casing.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Smaller service spaces &#13;
    for power supply to the ramp and bow visor operation and the hoistable car &#13;
    decks were arranged on the car deck port and starboard, forward and aft. An &#13;
    office for the cargo officer during loading and discharging was arranged in &#13;
    the aft service space.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 4 contained &#13;
    many passenger cabins and, aft, conference rooms, a cafeteria and passenger &#13;
    seats. The enclosed deck area ended at two public exits to the open-air aft &#13;
    deck. Decks 5 and 6 had passenger cabins covering the forward third and the &#13;
    remaining parts were used for tax free shop, information desk, restaurants, &#13;
    bars and entertainment areas. Both decks had two double-door public exits &#13;
    to the open-air aft decks. The accommodation spaces on decks 4, 5 and 6 extended &#13;
    from side to side without any open-air passage or other open-air spaces except &#13;
    the aft decks.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 7 contained &#13;
    the main part of the crew accommodation. This deck did not extend to the sides &#13;
    of the vessel, giving room for an open deck area on both sides. On the open &#13;
    deck there were the rescue stations and the embarkation area for lifeboats. &#13;
    The deck was accessible to passengers via two main staircases and between &#13;
    the aft open-air decks. The passageways contained cradles for liferafts and &#13;
    bins for lifejackets for passengers and crew. Forward on deck 8 was accommodation &#13;
    for the senior officers and, aft, additional crew accommodation spaces. The &#13;
    intermediate space was taken up by ventilation equipment and other service &#13;
    functions. The lifeboat davits and additional liferaft bins were located at &#13;
    the sides of this deck. Deck 8 was accessible to passengers only via external &#13;
    stairs from deck 7.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The navigation bridge &#13;
    was on deck 9. </font></p>&#13;

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.3 Propulsion system and &#13;
  control</b></font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The propulsion system consisted &#13;
  of four medium-speed diesel engines, connected in pairs to two propeller shafts &#13;
  via gear boxes. The engines were four-stroke turbo-charged engines with eight &#13;
  cylinders and a maximum continuous output of 4 400 kW each. They were designed &#13;
  to operate on heavy fuel oil. Maximum continuous operating revolutions of the &#13;
  engines were 600 rpm which corresponded to 188 rpm of the propellers.</font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Each propeller shaft carried &#13;
  one controllable-pitch propeller with a diameter of 4.0 m. The port-side propeller &#13;
  rotated clockwise and the starboard side one counter-clockwise.</font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The pitch control of the propellers &#13;
  was hydraulic, separate for each propeller. The control was effected electrically &#13;
  be power selector levers on the main control console on the bridge, on the bridge &#13;
  wings and in the engine control room. The control signal from the power selector &#13;
  affected the engine revolutions as well as the propeller pitch via an electro-hydraulic &#13;
  "combinator". Revolutions and pitch both increased at increasing power settings &#13;
  up to about 70% output, when the maximum continuous engine revolutions, i.e. &#13;
  800 rpm were reached. After that, the output could be further increased to 90% &#13;
  by increasing the propeller pitch only while the revolutions of the engines &#13;
  remained at 600 rpm. </font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">All the normal indicators, alarms &#13;
  and control devices were on the bridge and in the engine control room. The installation &#13;
  qualified for unmanned machinery space at sea in accordance with the classification &#13;
  requirements, but actual operation was at all times conducted with the engine &#13;
  control room manned by one engineer and one motorman.</font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The total fuel oil tank capacity &#13;
  was 940 m³ of heavy fuel oil and 291 m³ of marine diesel oil. Bunkering for &#13;
  a complete round trip was always done in Stockholm. </font></p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.4 Electrical system</b></font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The three-phase, 380 V, 50 &#13;
  Hz electrical system was fed by four main electrical generator sets. They had &#13;
  an output of 1065 kVA each and were capable of parallel operation. The generators &#13;
  were driven by four diesel engines, each supplying 1104 kW at 750 rpm. </font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">Transformers provided 220 V &#13;
  single-phase power for lighting and utility functions. The main electrical switchboard &#13;
  was in the engine control room. </font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">An emergency generator set in &#13;
  compliance with the SOLAS requirements was installed in a separate room on deck &#13;
  8 near the engine casing. The generator was powered by a diesel engine with &#13;
  an output of 312 kW at 1500 rpm. It supplied the emergency lighting system and &#13;
  also essential bridge equipment, including engine control, steering system, &#13;
  radars, gyro-compass, logs, echo-sounder, navigation lights, search lights, &#13;
  radio station, telephone system and public address system. </font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The emergency generator unit &#13;
  was designed to start automatically in case of loss of electrical power in the &#13;
  main network. The total starting and switch-in time was about 15 seconds.</font></p>&#13;
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Accumulators for emergency &#13;
  power in case of loss of all other electrical supply were installed in compliance &#13;
  with the SOLAS requirements. </font></p>&#13;

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.5 Ballast &#13;
  system</b></font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Two centrifugal &#13;
  ballast pumps were installed, each with a capacity of 300 m³/h. The pumps served &#13;
  ballast tanks which were the forepeak tank, the forward trim tank, two double-bottom &#13;
  tanks, one pair of heeling tanks and the aft peak tank, giving a total capacity &#13;
  of 1212 m³.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The heeling tanks &#13;
  were side tanks with a capacity of 183 m³ each and intended for adjusting a &#13;
  list of the vessel when needed. The list that could be compensated with one &#13;
  heeling tank full and the other empty was about eight degrees. A separate heeling &#13;
  tank pump could be operated from the deck office at the stern ramp and from &#13;
  the engine control room. The connection valve between the heeling tanks (cross-flooding &#13;
  valve) was designed to close in case of failure of electrical power. The open/close &#13;
  condition of this valve was indicated by red/green lights on the control panel &#13;
  for the watertight doors on the bridge. - See photo below. </font></p>&#13;

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.6 Car deck &#13;
  arrangement</b></font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The vessel had &#13;
  a deck for loading trucks, cars and other wheeled cargo. The car deck was the &#13;
  vessel's freeboard deck and identified as deck number 2. It extended from side &#13;
  to side and from bow to stern, with a centre casing immediately starboard of &#13;
  the centre line. The available deck space was divided into four lanes on the &#13;
  port side and three on the starboard side. Lashing fittings were mounted along &#13;
  the lanes on the car deck.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Personnel access &#13;
  to the car deck was via stairs and lifts in the centre casing. Four of the lifts &#13;
  had doors leading to the starboard side of the car deck and one had doors to &#13;
  the port side. A total of eleven doors, six starboard and five port, led from &#13;
  the car deck to the stairs inside the casing. The doors were sliding-type steel &#13;
  doors, meeting the SOLAS fire resistance requirements. The locks of the doors &#13;
  were remotely operated from the Information desk on deck 5. The doors were not &#13;
  locked at sea. </font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The car deck space &#13;
  was ventilated by electrically driven fans, located on both sides at the forward &#13;
  and aft ends of the deck area. The air channels ended at the open deck 4, on &#13;
  the forecastle deck level in the front bulkhead of the superstructure.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Twelve closable &#13;
  4" scuppers were installed along each side of the deck. The scuppers were normally &#13;
  left open.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Four TV cameras &#13;
  for monitoring the car deck area were mounted. </font></p>&#13;

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.7 Bridge &#13;
  layout</b></font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The navigation &#13;
  bridge was on the uppermost deck (deck 9), 9.2 m aft of the forward end of the &#13;
  superstructure. The bridge wings extended over the ship's sides by about 1.5 &#13;
  m and were fully enclosed.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The central part &#13;
  of the bridge extended forward of the wings by about 2 m. In the original design &#13;
  there was a console containing all major navigation and control equipment at &#13;
  the front bulkhead, just below the windows. The steering console was located &#13;
  on the centre line, just behind the front windows. The bridge was rebuilt in &#13;
  January 1994 and some of the navigation equipment was renewed. The navigation &#13;
  console at the front bulkhead was partly removed, and a new conning station &#13;
  was installed to port of the centre-line. The design of the conning station &#13;
  was of the Pilot-Copilot type, commonly used in Baltic ferries.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The new console &#13;
  contained two ARPA radars, DGP's (Differential Global Positioning System) receivers, &#13;
  the main auto-pilot, propulsion control levers, VHF telephones, mobile telephones &#13;
  and equipment for internal communications. From the two navigators' seats, and &#13;
  the captain's seat, normally placed to the port of the conning console, the &#13;
  panel with indicator lamps for visor and ramp was within sight.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The fin stabilisers &#13;
  and associated controls were also installed in 1994. The original "Roll-Nix" &#13;
  stabilisation system had been found inadequate. It was, however, not removed &#13;
  and had sometimes been used in strong following wind.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> A separate chartroom &#13;
  was located on the starboard side, in the aft part of the bridge. The corresponding &#13;
  space on the port side was an open area containing the fire alarm centre and &#13;
  various cabinets for storage, etc. </font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The main entrance &#13;
  to the bridge, from the accommodation, was on the centre line at the aft end &#13;
  of the bridge, where a door to the staircase connected the bridge with the officer &#13;
  and crew accommodation on decks 8 and 7. On the port side at the aft end of &#13;
  the bridge there was a door to the open deck.</font></p>&#13;
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Because of the &#13;
  retracted position of the navigation bridge, only the flag pole on the bow of &#13;
  the vessel was visible from the conning station - see drawing below - whilst &#13;
  the most forward part of the visor could be seen through the two windows on &#13;
  deck level at both sides of the extended central part of the bridge, as can &#13;
  be seen on the drawing below. A monitor, showing among other things, the transmissions &#13;
  from the four car-deck cameras, was placed at the chartroom entrance and could &#13;
  not be seen from the conning station. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The visor &#13;
    and ramp installations of the ESTONIA were of a configuration common on ferries &#13;
    in traffic between Finland and Sweden at the time of her construction. The &#13;
    installations comprised an upward-opening bow visor and a loading ramp at &#13;
    the bow and two loading ramps at the stern, which were hinged at car deck &#13;
    level and closed when raised.</font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position, &#13;
    the upper end of the bow ramp extended into a box-like housing on the deck &#13;
    of the visor, the ramp house. The complete bow ramp and the operating and &#13;
    locking devices for the visor as well as the stern ramps and the hanging decks &#13;
    were designed and delivered by an independent company, von Tell Trading &amp; &#13;
    Co. AB, Gothenburg (hereafter called von Tell AB), an established supplier &#13;
    of hydraulically operated ship's installations. The design was based on a &#13;
    detailed specification by the shipyard. Von Tell AB used a subcontractor, &#13;
    Grimmereds Verkstads AB, Gothenburg for manufacturing complete sets of components &#13;
    for the ramps, the hanging decks and the locking devices, including those &#13;
    for the visor. The routine contacts between the Yard and the supplier were &#13;
    via von Tell GmbH, Hamburg, a subsidiary of von Tell AB. Incorporation of &#13;
    the system into the ship and manufacture of the attachment structure were &#13;
    shipyard work, although under the supervision of a von Tell representative. &#13;
    See Subchapter 2.4.2. The equipment delivered by von Tell was identical to &#13;
    that built for the preceding newbuilding, DIANA II, except for the slightly &#13;
    increased length of the bow ramp and the changes of the car platforms dictated &#13;
    by the greater length of the vessel. According to available information the &#13;
    visor operating and locking system for DIANA II was designed by von Tell AB &#13;
    staff who had experience with similar installations from their previous employments. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Bureau Veritas &#13;
    rules valid at the time had no details regarding procedures for calculating &#13;
    sea loads on the bow visor. It was stated in general wording "that doors should &#13;
    be firmly secured and that structural reinforcements should be made to attachment &#13;
    points of cleats, hinges and jacks". The general wording in the rules also &#13;
    specified that the scantlings for the visor structure should be equivalent &#13;
    to that of the hull itself.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vertical and &#13;
    longitudinal sea loads to which the bow visor could be exposed were calculated &#13;
    separately by the Yard and by von Tell AB. The Bureau Veritas rules gave no &#13;
    detailed guidance for such calculations. The Yard therefore used for this &#13;
    purpose the nominal "pressure heights" given by Bureau Veritas in the Note &#13;
    Documentaire BM2 of 05.04.1976, which was originally issued as a general guidance &#13;
    for determining the loads on the bows of large ships, whilst von Tell AB used &#13;
    nominal pressure heads per unit of projected area specified in the rules of &#13;
    Lloyd's Register Shipping, valid at the time ESTONIA was under construction. &#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b>The Visor &#13;
    Construction and Functioning</b></font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was a &#13;
    Ro-Ro passenger ferry with visor, bow ramp and stern ramps. The visor was &#13;
    the most forward part of the vessel and pivoted around 2 hinges fitted at &#13;
    the forecastle deck, i.e. C-deck, having its opening and closing move-ments &#13;
    performed by 2 hydraulic lifting cylinders (actuators). The construction of &#13;
    the visor corresponded to the construction of the bow with material dimensioned &#13;
    according to the general requirements of the Classification Society (for details &#13;
    see Subchapter 2.4.3). The lower forward part was ice-strengthened. The visor &#13;
    consisted mainly of shell plating being an extension of the ship's shell plating &#13;
    and contour, the forecastle deck, the bottom part, the 2 aft bulkheads, the &#13;
    3 horizontal stringers with the 5 bow pointers in between respectively on &#13;
    top of the 2 vertical partial bulkheads and transverse stiffeners. The two &#13;
    so-called visor arms (beams) extended about 3 m aft of the visor and ended &#13;
    in the two hinge arrangements by which the visor was connected to the vessel &#13;
    and which were the pivoting parts as well. The design weight of the visor &#13;
    was about 55 mts.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Between the two &#13;
    visor arms a box-shaped housing - the so-called ramp house - was fitted into &#13;
    which the upper end of the bow ramp extended in closed position. This was &#13;
    the interlock between visor and bow ramp, a configuration quite common at &#13;
    the time VIKING SALLY was designed and built (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.67.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.6.2.67</a> - photo VIKING SALLY). In closed position the visor &#13;
    was connected to the foreship by three hydraulically operated locking devices. &#13;
    One of these locking devices - the "Atlantic lock" - was mounted on the forepeak &#13;
    deck - A-deck - whilst the other 2 were side locks mounted in the front bulkheads &#13;
    of the vessel with the mating lugs at the lower parts of the aft bulkheads &#13;
    of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, there &#13;
    were 2 mechanical locking devices - the so-called manual side locks - mounted &#13;
    on both sides below the hydraulic side locks. The manual side locks were - &#13;
    according to Bureau Veritas - "Heavy Weather Securings" (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.37</a> - letter B.V. to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.6.2.75</a> - photo showing mock-up of the manual side lock). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Three strong locating &#13;
    horns - one on the forepeak deck called "pyramid" and one at each front bulkhead &#13;
    of the vessel - engaged recesses in the visor bottom respectively on both &#13;
    aft bulkheads of the visor when in closed position and were intended to absorb &#13;
    lateral loads.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position &#13;
    the visor bottom rested on the forepeak deck mainly in way of the strong stempost &#13;
    which took about 75% of its weight, whilst two steel pads welded to the forepeak &#13;
    deck at the aft part of the visor bottom took a further ca. 20% and the remaining &#13;
    5% were absorbed by the rubber packings. The visor was kept down by its weight &#13;
    and the 3 (or 5) locking devices which pulled the visor tight against the &#13;
    rubber packings on forepeak deck and both front bulkheads. Thereby any possible &#13;
    play was eliminated and the visor's inside was kept watertight. Forces acting &#13;
    in the forward/aft direction on the visor were transferred by the hinges, &#13;
    the locking devices and the front bulkheads into the structure of the vessel. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In open position &#13;
    the visor was secured by 2 parking devices consisting of 2 hydraulically operated &#13;
    bolts with mating lugs at the aft end of both visor arms.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For further details &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This locking device &#13;
    consisted of a locking bolt (1), movable horizontally in a transverse direction, &#13;
    guided in a bolt housing (2). In extended position the tip of the bolt engaged &#13;
    a support bushing (3). The bolt housing was fixed to the forepeak deck by &#13;
    means of two steel lugs (4) and the bushing was installed in a third similar &#13;
    lug (5), to which a support bracket (6) was fitted. A mating lug (7), attached &#13;
    to the visor itself, was located between the bolt housing and the support &#13;
    bushing when the visor was in the closed position and the extended bolt then &#13;
    engaged the hole in the mating lug.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bolt was moved &#13;
    in the bolt housing between the retracted position and the extended position &#13;
    by means of an hydraulic actuator (8), operated from the control panel located &#13;
    behind the bow and the ramp on the car deck. A spring-loaded mechanical plunger &#13;
    (9), perpendicular to the bolt, engaged grooves in the bolt in the open and &#13;
    closed position, thereby securing the bolt mechanically in its extreme positions, &#13;
    regardless of hydraulic pressure. The bolt was also locked hydraulically at &#13;
    any time because the hydraulic fluid was trapped in the system, regardless &#13;
    of whether the hydraulic system was under pressure or not. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The mating lug at &#13;
    the aft end of the bottom of the visor consisted of a single steel lug, welded &#13;
    to a transverse beam of the visor bottom structure and supported by a bracket. &#13;
    The lug had a hole for the locking bolt with an original diameter of 85 millimetres &#13;
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.70.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.70</a> &#13;
    - drawing of Atlantic lock).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the bolt was &#13;
    moving from open to closed position or the other way round, a vertical plate &#13;
    (10), fitted to the bolt initially, contacted 2 mechanical limit switches &#13;
    fitted to the sensor plate (11), which activated the indicator lights on the &#13;
    control panel on the car deck to show "red" when the bolt was open and "green" &#13;
    when the bolt was in closed position. In case the bolt would be in an intermittent &#13;
    position there would be no indicator light shining.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The control panel &#13;
    was located at the forepart of the car deck at port side (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.71.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.6.2.71</a> - Photo of ESTONIA with the open visor and control &#13;

    2.6.4.81.</a> The above description as well as the relevant drawing show the &#13;
    condition at the time the vessel was delivered to AB Sally in June 1980.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The Hydraulic &#13;
    Side Locks</b> were installed at about 1/3 of the height of the visor and &#13;
    consisted of two lugs, mounted to the aft bulkheads of the visor and extending, &#13;
    when the visor was closed, into two openings in the front bulkheads of the &#13;
    hull, inside the rubber packings, whereafter hydraulically operated bolts &#13;
    engaged the holes of the visor lugs. The hydraulic bolt installations were &#13;
    similar to that of the Atlantic lock, i.e. a bolt moving in a bolt housing &#13;
    and, when extended, engaging a support bushing. The visor lug inserted between &#13;
    the bolt housing and the support bushing. The bolt was moved by a hydraulic &#13;
    actuator. The position of the bolt, fully retracted and fully extended, was &#13;
    sensed by magnetic type limit switches activating indicator lights.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Additional hydraulic &#13;
    cylinders - so-called ice-cylinders - were installed at each side to push &#13;
    in a forward direction on the visor lugs when the visor was to open. This &#13;
    installation was intended to assist in breaking the visor open in case it &#13;
    had become frozen fast in closed position. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two vertical stiffeners &#13;
    were installed on the front side of the plating separated by a distance slightly &#13;
    larger than the thickness of the lug itself, to comply with the remark on &#13;
    drawing 49111-330 made by the plan approver of B.V., i.e.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Local reinforcements &#13;
      of the ship's structure in way of locking devices to surveyor's satisfaction.«</i> &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Directly below these &#13;
    hydraulic side locks, at each side a further set of locking devices, the "manual &#13;
    side locks", were installed consisting of a strong bolt with nut at vessel's &#13;
    side and a strong hook at each side of the visor's aft bulkheads, which also &#13;
    extended through a similar narrow opening into the ship's side. The arrangements &#13;
    of hydraulic and manual side locks can be seen from a respective photo attached &#13;
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.74.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.74. &#13;
    </a>The photo shows the hydraulic lock closed, whilst the manual lock is not &#13;

    the manual side lock is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.6.2.75.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After closing of &#13;
    the hydraulic side locks from the control panel on the A-deck the operator &#13;
    or somebody else had to walk into the port side house, up the stairs to B-deck, &#13;
    forward beside the chain locker, then climb through an opening in the deck &#13;
    down into the void space on A-deck from where both the hydraulic and manual &#13;
    side locks were accessible and the bolt of the manual lock could easily be &#13;
    moved between the hooks of the visor. The same procedure had to be repeated &#13;
    at starboard side. The distance to be covered from the control panel to close &#13;
    both port and starboard manual side locks is only about 38 m. The way to walk &#13;
    can be seen from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.76.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hinges, around &#13;
    which the visor was opening and closing, consisted of a steel/bronze bushing &#13;
    system fitted through holes in the side plates of the visor arms and two steel &#13;
    lugs with a housing in between welded at both ends of the visor arms to the &#13;
    forecastle deck plating. A stainless steel bolt was leading through each of &#13;
    the assemblies at port and starboard side. Securing plates bolted to the outer &#13;
    respectively inner sides of all four steel bushings prevented moving out of &#13;
    the bolt.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bearings were &#13;
    lubricated through drillings in the bolt and grease nipples at its ends. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the hinge arrangement &#13;
    was von Tell design and the bushings, and subsequently the bolts, were installed &#13;

      of the ESTONIA. In such case that the Yard would not have accepted my objections, &#13;
      I would have the left the vessel and informed my principals.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
      happened for example on a vessel at Dunkirk. I was instructed to carry out &#13;
      repairs to some hatch covers. When the crew refused to supply me with the &#13;
      spare parts necessary to perform a proper repair (although these spare parts &#13;
      were on board) and a proper repair, based on my professional experience, &#13;
      would not have been possible otherwise, I refused to carry on working and &#13;
      returned to Kiel. <br/>&#13;
      The steel bushings were welded into the visor arms under my supervision &#13;
      and subsequently milled to such an extent that the bronze bushings did fit. &#13;
      These bore holes were performed very exactly to assure that the port and &#13;
      starboard sides were in exact alignment in order to avoid excessive loads &#13;
      on the hinges during opening and closing of the visor. Thereafter the shafts &#13;
      were inserted, whereby also the distance rings were put in place (2 mm thick). &#13;
      I do remember this work in particular, because it was difficult, time consuming, &#13;
      and required a lot of care. The shafts were made of NIROSTA (stainless) &#13;
      steel and had grease grooves with grease nipples. By means of these grease &#13;
      nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once a week.«</font></i></p>&#13;

    the Meyer Werft managers and employees have time and again confirmed that &#13;
    the bore holes in the visor arms for the steel bushings had been drilled and &#13;
    not burned and, as a matter of fact, the port outer part of the visor hinge &#13;
    plate still shows circumferential drilling marks. The sketch below shows the &#13;

    and Hydraulic Cylinders (Actuators) The hydraulic system of VIKING SALLY, &#13;
    serving the car deck installations including visor and ramps, consisted of &#13;
    3 pump stations, 2 big ones and 1 small one. The working pressure for the &#13;
    big ones was about 250 bar and for the small one about 150 bar. </font></p>&#13;

      side hanging decks. <br/><b>1</b> big pump station in the fore part of the car deck on the port side &#13;
      served the bow visor, the bow ramp, the starboard stern ramp, the drive-on &#13;
      ramps on starboard, and the starboard hanging decks. <br/><b>1</b> small pump station placed in the centre casing on B-deck level &#13;
      served 2 pilot doors, 4 passenger doors, and 2 passenger bridges.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The big pump &#13;
    stations</b> consisted of 1 oil tank each containing 900 litres and 3 pumps. &#13;
    When the system was in normal operation 2 pumps were running and the 3rd one &#13;
    was serving as a reserve unit. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The small pump &#13;
    station</b> consisted of 2 pumps and 1 oil tank containing 150 litres. When &#13;
    the system was in normal operation 1 pump was working and the other served &#13;
    as a reserve unit. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic system &#13;
    was connected in parallel and the pumps were pressure compensated axial piston &#13;
    pumps which delivered only the required quantity of oil. This quantity, required &#13;
    by each user, was adjusted by throttle valves. The max. working pressure of &#13;
    the pump station was regulated by a safety valve adjusted at newbuilding. &#13;
    It came only into effect if the pressure would exceed the max. working pressure &#13;
    to which the valve was adjusted and should never be changed.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon failure of &#13;
    one of the big pump stations the other one could be connected by switching &#13;
    off the two shut-off valves of the failing pump station and by opening the &#13;
    two valves located in the aft pump station, whereafter the "cross-over" between &#13;
    the two hydraulic systems was established. The operating time was slightly &#13;
    longer if the pump station aft was used to serve the forward system, i.e. &#13;
    the bow visor, the bow ramp and drive-on ramps on starboard side. </font></p>&#13;

    the hydraulic system of the actuators of the visor, bow and stern ramps do &#13;

    in detail, whereby the figures refer to the sketch below:</font></p>&#13;

  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing &#13;
      slide valves were moved (19) from right to left, oil would flow from the &#13;
      pressure pipes (P) to the piston undersides, the piston rods moved upwards &#13;
      and the visor opened. The oil at the piston rod sides flowed undisturbed &#13;
      through valves 39 into the return pipes (T).</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing &#13;
      slide valves were moved from left to right the oil flow reached in throttled &#13;
      condition (39) the upper cylinder chambers (piston rod side). The pressure &#13;
      in the upper cylinder chambers pushed the pistons downwards. Also the weight &#13;
      of the visor acted on the pistons. At the underside of the pistons overpressure &#13;
      developed as the stop valves (46) closed, the non-return valve (38) prevented &#13;
      oil flow in this direction and the pressure limitation valves (15) were &#13;
      not yet open. Only if excessive pressure had built up at the lower sides &#13;
      of the pistons would the pressure limitation valves (15) open and the visor &#13;
      move downwards.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - There were two &#13;
      reasons for the installation of such valves (15). On the one hand such valves &#13;
      prevented the rapid falling down of the visor in case of pipe and/or hose &#13;
      failures, on the other hand the visor was unable to close by its own weight &#13;
      only. Consequently it was possible to keep the visor in a partly open respectively &#13;
      closed position. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the case of &#13;
      the bow and the stern ramps, which were connected to identical hydraulic &#13;
      systems, it was the other way round because the weight of the ramps acted &#13;
      in the opening direction.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In case the &#13;
      visor and bow as well as the stern ramps should be closed or kept closed &#13;
      by hydraulic pressure, the piston rod sides had to be pressurized and the &#13;
      actuators would retract respectively remain retracted. </font></p>&#13;

    were located in the void spaces above and below B-deck as it is visible from &#13;
    the drawing on the next page, they were accessible for the crew. This means &#13;
    that it has been possible to manipulate the valves at the visor and bow ramp &#13;
    actuators from inside the side-houses without having to touch the control &#13;
    panel on the car deck. By means of the above explained "cross-over" effected &#13;
    at the aft hydraulic station - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.31.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.2.31</a> - it has also been possible to put pressure on the cylinders &#13;
    of visor and bow ramp by means of the aft hydraulic station. In summary it &#13;
    can thus be concluded that it was possible to put pressure on the actuators &#13;
    of visor and bow ramp, i.e. to keep them closed by hydraulic pressure, without &#13;
    having to use the control panel on the car deck.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can further be &#13;
    concluded that it was possible to keep visor, bow and stern ramps in a semi-open/-closed &#13;
    condition which, however, required the running of at least one hydraulic pump &#13;
    under continuous load changes (on/off). The visor actuators were connected &#13;
    to the vessel's B-deck by 2 lugs for each cylinder (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.4.79.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.6.4.79</a> - photo showing B-deck).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Below this deck there &#13;
    were respective stiffeners and brackets fitted, which transferred the forces &#13;
    into the vessel's structure. To lift the visor 118 ts. were required at each &#13;
    cylinder. The maximum lifting power of 1 cylinder at a design pressure of &#13;
    250 bar was 153 ts. The test pressure of the cylinders was 350 bar.</font></p>&#13;

    400 bar. Reportedly the other components of the system remained unchanged. &#13;

<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On the route &#13;
    from Turku to Stockholm ice is usually met more frequently and longer compared &#13;
    to the route Tallinn-Stockholm, because the ice inside the archipelago grows &#13;
    faster and disappears later. If, however, the Gulf of Finland respectively &#13;
    the Baltic is covered by ice the route Tallinn-Stockholm is much more difficult &#13;
    and problematic in comparison to proceeding through ice in the archipelago, &#13;
    because the ice at sea is much heavier and thicker. The ice moves with wind &#13;
    and/or current, ice channels open and close quickly, wind and current press &#13;
    the ice floes together and on top of each other, thereby creating ice barriers &#13;
    of several meters thickness.</font></font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The maximum speed &#13;
    when proceeding at sea through ice should not exceed 7-8 knots, whereby the &#13;
    ice pressure on the visor should always be the decisive factor.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The risk of sustaining &#13;
    severe damage to the bow area and to the under-water hull, however, is most &#13;
    imminent if the Gulf of Finland and/or the Baltic Sea are jointly partly covered &#13;
    by ice and the bridge is manned by inexperienced navigators. The vessel then &#13;
    quickly picks up speed in free water and subsequently crashes with high speed &#13;
    into ice fields, thereby colliding with thick and solid ice floes. </font></li>&#13;

</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>His function &#13;

    at the control panel. </i></font></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He explained &#13;
    the different handles and also the indicator lights. - He remembered clearly &#13;
    the 2 hooks and 4 bolts of the bow ramp as well as</font></i></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the hydraulic &#13;
    side locks, the Atlantic lock, and also explained that they had never engaged &#13;
    the manual side locks.</font></i></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At some time &#13;
    probably in 1982 it was realised that the visor was no more closing properly &#13;
    because it was in a misaligned condition athwartships. He thinks that the &#13;
    starboard corner was standing a bit up. It was for this reason that the Atlantic &#13;
    lock bolt could no more move through the visor lug. The matter was discussed &#13;
    with the engine crew and it was considered what could be done. </font></i></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Engine repairman &#13;
    Koivisto considered himself to be the visor expert and offered to rectify &#13;
    the Atlantic lock to the effect that the bolt would fit again. Luttunen remembers &#13;
    that Koivisto was even called back from vacation to do the modification.</font></i> &#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>In the presence &#13;
    of Luttunen and motorman Göran Lindström Koivisto cut off the upper part of &#13;
    the lugs of the Atlantic lock and took off the bushings. Thereafter he welded &#13;
    extended parts on the lug remains and the holes in the lugs now looked like &#13;
    an ellipse, the bushings did not fit any more and were left out as still the &#13;
    bolt would not go smoothly through the visor lug, which was extending apparently &#13;
    too much aft or too much forward. In any event Koivisto cut something off &#13;
    the inside of the visor lug, whereby Luttunen is of the opinion that it was &#13;
    from the forward part.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After &#13;
    the repairs were completed they realised at once that it was impossible and &#13;
    decided to contact the inspector ashore. The poor modification was inspected &#13;
    and about one week later Swedish speaking people came from the company von &#13;
    Tell AB, cut off completely all 3 lugs of the Atlantic lock and welded new &#13;
    ones to the A-deck with bushings inserted.<br/>&#13;
    He believes also that it was then realised that there was something wrong &#13;
    with the hydraulic, which was adjusted. The visor lug remained - as far as &#13;
    he remembers - unchanged, i.e. should still be the original.<br/>&#13;
    When the repairs were completed the von Tell people expressly prohibited Koivisto &#13;
    or anybody else on board to ever manipulate the Atlantic lock again.</font></i></li>&#13;

    Bureau Veritas on a continuous five-year timetable for hull and machinery &#13;
    in combination with a schedule of annual surveys. On average, the surveying &#13;
    program involved five to six onboard-survey visits per year which were mainly &#13;
    carried out by the principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, Lars-Olof &#13;
    Ålander, who also carried out the Load Line Surveys on behalf of the F.B.N. &#13;
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    2.4.3.44.2</a>. At this time the visor was kept weathertight and the rubber &#13;
    packings were renewed when required, at least once a year, either by MacGregor, &#13;
    Turku or by the crew - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.99.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    annual drydockings were mostly done at the Turku Repair Yard. Two were at &#13;
    the Valmet Helsinki Yard, one after grounding damage in 1984 and one in 1985 &#13;
    for repair of ice damage and for modification of the stern area of the hull &#13;
    by incorporation of the "duck tail" extension. Two drydockings were made in &#13;
    Stockholm, one in 1985 for repair of a leaking propeller shaft seal and one &#13;
    in 1988 for repair of grounding damage. The damage was surveyed and repaired &#13;
    in drydock following normal practice.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Besides the &#13;
    ice damage in 1985, two other occasions of ice damage were recorded, during &#13;
    the winters of 1982 and 1987. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The drydocking &#13;
    in conjunction with transfer to the Effjohn Group was done in 1990 at the &#13;
    Naantali branch of the Turku Repair Yard. Thereafter the vessel made some &#13;
    trips as SILJA STAR in her initial trade and was then laid-up at the Perno &#13;
    Shipyard outside Turku for some months until the beginning of 1991 when she &#13;
    was put in service on the Vaasa trade. The interior was upgraded and the sound-proofing &#13;
    in the cabin area was improved by building in ca. 85 tons of steel during &#13;
    this time. Thereafter an inclining experiment was performed by Veli-Matti &#13;
    Junilla of Ship Consulting Oy, Turku and a revised "Stability Booklet" issued, &#13;
    which was approved by the F.B.N. (Edelmann) on 20.01.91 and is attached as &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - All electrical &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The organisation &#13;
    of F.B.N. has already been explained in Subchapter 2.4.4. Reportedly it did &#13;
    not change very much during the following years. The role of the F.B.N. (and &#13;
    also Sjöfartsverket) Ship Safety Inspectors, whilst it was trading under Finnisg &#13;

  </ul><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As long as the vessel &#13;
    remained under Finnish flag and thus under the responsibility and supervision &#13;
    of the F.B.N. periodical inspections were apparently carried out every 3 months &#13;
    by F.B.N. inspectors, as can be seen from the attached extract of the control &#13;
    file together with inspection certificate and inspection report issued by &#13;
    F.B.N. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.88.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 3.4.88</a> &#13;

    by changing the dates on the previous one.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, &#13;
    the vessel never did create problems from the point of view of the F.B.N. &#13;
    They were not informed by the owners when she was sold. According to the F.B.N. &#13;
    there was no exchange of information/documentation with B.V. before, during &#13;
    or after take-over by the Estonians, because they became aware of the flag &#13;
    and name change only when WASA KING was deleted from the Finnish Register &#13;
    (information H. Valkonen). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) Maintenance</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In principle, &#13;
    the vessel was drydocked every second year, but during the intervals the bottom, &#13;
    the rudders and the propellers were inspected and, if necessary, cleaned by &#13;
    divers.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The hull &#13;
    was at first painted red (VIKING SALLY), subsequently white (SILJA STAR and &#13;
    WASA KING), the underwater ship including the bootop area was coated with &#13;
    INERTA ice-resistant paint - blue. For details reference is made to <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    parts of bow visor and bow ramp including the locking devices and hydraulic &#13;
    cylinders (actuators) were checked weekly and greased monthly. General maintenance &#13;
    and necessary repairs were carried out by MacGregor, Turku.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Occasionally &#13;
    hydraulic pressure hoses and packings were renewed, cracks in the mountings &#13;
    of the lifting cylinders of the bow visor were re-welded by the crew (information: &#13;
    Yngve Röblom, Lars Karlsson), the pockets for the securing bolts of the bow &#13;
    ramp were strengthened by the crew (information: Lars Karlsson).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- According &#13;
    to the boatswain Juhani Luttunen already in 1982 it was noted that the visor &#13;
    was slightly misaligned, i.e. the starboard side stood up by about 1 cm. This &#13;
    resulted in a misalignment of the Atlantic lock arrangement and hence the &#13;
    bolt did not fit anymore. To rectify this, motorman Koivisto changed the position &#13;
    of the lugs on the forepeak deck and also modified the visor lug, but in such &#13;
    a miserable manner that the lugs on the forepeak deck had to be completely &#13;
    renewed. This was done by von Tell AB, Gothenburg. For details see Subchapter &#13;
    3.3 and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.3.83.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 3.3.83</a> &#13;
    - Interview Juhani Luttunen.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As stated &#13;
    above the vessel was, in principle, drydocked every second year, but due to &#13;
    repeated problems with the Cedarvall stern tube seals she had to be drydocked &#13;
    during the intervals to repair these seals. From 1987 onwards the owners' &#13;
    specifications for all dockings, the quotations of the yard and the final &#13;
    repair invoices of the yard, which since that time was always Turku Shipyard, &#13;
    Turku, are available to this 'Group of Experts'. According to the records &#13;
    of International Paint, the suppliers of Inerta Ice Resistant Paint, the vessel &#13;
    was also drydocked in May 1985 at Valmet Shipyard/Helsinki, where the duck &#13;

    ice-winter, probably in 1985/86, at sea water was noted in the visor up to &#13;
    the outside water level. As it turned out that this condition did not improve &#13;
    notably after renewal of the rubber packings and that the water caused a short-circuit &#13;
    in the mechanical sensors of the Atlantic lock, which also affected other &#13;
    installations on the car deck, the mechanical sensors were replaced by watertight &#13;
    magnetic limit switches.<br/>&#13;
    Lars Karlsson - chief engineer of the vessel for 12 years - stated in respect &#13;
    of <b>rubber packings</b> and the exchange of the <b>mechanical sensors</b> &#13;
    to <b>magnetic limit switches</b> the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The rubber &#13;
      packings of the visor were changed once a year. The packings were mainly &#13;
      damaged on A-deck and ca. 1 m upwards the front bulkheads because the final &#13;
      movement before closure is backwards - not downwards - which destroys the &#13;
      packings due to the rubbing effect. Therefore we did put grease (same as &#13;
      used for the hinges) on the packings and it became better.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At &#13;
      some time, probably after the strong ice winter 1986/87, we increasingly &#13;
      had problems with electrical failures, short circuits, etc. with the sensors &#13;
      for the indicator lights of the Atlantic lock. So I checked with other vessels, &#13;
      e.g. VIKING SONG and VIKING SAGA and also the market, and finally bought &#13;
      rather expensive magnetic limit switches, which were installed by electrician &#13;
      Sjögren and we never had problems again. I have been many times with B.V. &#13;
      surveyor Lars-Olof Ålander inside the closed visor when water or light test &#13;
      was made during Load Line survey. I believe that at the same time also the &#13;
      indicator lights were checked.« </font></i></p>&#13;

    information obtained from Håkan Karlsson/Charles Richardson the rubber packings &#13;
    in way of visor and bow ramp were last renewed by the crew during the lay-up &#13;
    time end of 1990/beginning 1991 before SILJA STAR was renamed WASA KING and &#13;
    nothing was done thereafter until the sale in mid January 1993. Consequently &#13;
    at the time of the take-over the same rubber packings, respectively their &#13;
    remains, were in place which had been renewed at the end of 1990. Therefore &#13;
    the last Finnish crew, when preparing the next yard time scheduled for January &#13;
    1993, had asked for renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of the visor &#13;
    and 10 m in way of the bow ramp.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In winter it was &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower parts &#13;
    of the visor were subject to considerable wear, i.e. from the outside due &#13;
    to ice contact and from the inside due to the continuous change between seawater/air &#13;
    as well as additionally to the "sloshing effect" caused by the water moving &#13;
    forward/aft and side to side, comparable to a partly filled tank. The outside &#13;
    was coated with ice-resistant paint (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    3.4.89</a>) which could be renewed only during the annual overhaul at the &#13;
    yard. Therefore the ice damaged parts of the coating were painted over with &#13;
    normal blue paint at the end of the ice season. As the lower part of the visor &#13;
    was difficult to access the electrical blocking between visor and bow ramp &#13;
    was manipulated by the electrician in such a way that the visor could be lowered &#13;
    whilst the bow ramp was open. Thus the bottom and lower part of visor were &#13;
    accessible for maintenance work. According to Håkan Karlsson during the time &#13;
    as VIKING SALLY little or no maintenance work was carried out on the visor &#13;
    inside. Lars Karlsson:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Although it &#13;
      should be impossible due to the electrical system the visor can be closed &#13;
      if the ramp is open when the valves are operated manually. In case the rails &#13;
      of the ramp should be deformed this is due to the lowered down visor for &#13;
      working purposes.«</i></font></p>&#13;

      of the visor hinges, its weldings, etc. and also the inside of the visor &#13;
      including locking devices and its welding seams.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During &#13;
      one such inspection I found cracks in way of the foundations of the hydraulic &#13;
      cylinders for the bow ramp bolts which were of fatigue nature and not due &#13;
      to overload. We welded strengthening plates to the foundations to stop the &#13;
      crack development.<br/>&#13;
      Probably in 1990 we had to change the spherical bearing of the port lifting &#13;
      cylinder and after that experienced twice that the Nirosta bolt of the port &#13;
      visor hinges broke the outer securing plate screws and moved out by ca. &#13;
      1 cm. This was noted by the deck officer being on forecastle deck for berthing &#13;
      because he found the broken off screws. The bolt was hammered back into &#13;
      position, the screw holes in the steel bushing drilled out and the securing &#13;
      plate refitted. If it would have happened again we would have investigated &#13;
      the cause, however, during my time, it did not occur again.<br/>&#13;
      We never had greasing problems. Once per month grease was pressed into the &#13;
      bolts.<br/>&#13;
      I have never seen the bolts out.«</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> &#13;

    office for the Nordic countries was located in Copenhagen since 1990. The &#13;
    head office for Sweden was in Gothenburg, the manager was Hans Olsson. Further, &#13;
    there were B.V. offices in Trelleborg, Malmö and Stockholm whose senior and &#13;
    staff surveyors reported to the Gothenburg office. Hans Olsson reported directly &#13;
    to the head office in Paris.</font></font></p>&#13;

      also a B.V. office in Helsinki which inspected the vessel in Finland as &#13;
      long as she was flying the Finnish flag. The office was no more involved &#13;
      after the flag and name change to ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the &#13;
    previous principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, Lars Olof Ålander, &#13;
    N&amp;T had made it a condition for the ESTONIA to remain under classification &#13;
    of B.V. that only one surveyor, namely his junior colleague, Anders Wirstam, &#13;
    should carry out all the required surveys both in respect of class items and &#13;
    the safety items to be inspected on behalf of the E.N.M.B. This was accepted &#13;
    by B.V. and Anders Wirstam from the Stockholm office became the exclusive &#13;
    surveyor for the ESTONIA in all respects. Upon instructions from the head &#13;
    office in Paris he reported directly to the manager of the B.V. head office &#13;
    for Sweden in Gothenburg, Hans Olsson, thereby bypassing the principal surveyor &#13;
    Lars Olof Ålander - see also<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.4.3.44.2.</a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As mentioned &#13;
    before, a contract was agreed also between B.V. and E.N.M.B. and signed already &#13;
    on the 18.08.92 (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.2.114.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 6.2.114</a>), which provided that B.V. would act as agent for the &#13;
    Estonian Administration for the purpose of surveying Estonian flag ships with &#13;
    classification certificates issued by B.V. in order to determine the compliance &#13;
    of such vessels with the mandatory requirements of certain International Conventions &#13;
    referred to in Annex 1 - which includes SOLAS 1974. As the contract had already &#13;
    been running since August 1992 it has to be assumed that B.V. had already &#13;
    carried out some inspections of Estonian flag cargo vessels, but was uncertain &#13;
    about the requirements in respect of car/passenger ferries like the ESTONIA. &#13;
    Therefore B.V. sought the assistance of Shipinspec. The approach, however, &#13;
    was not made by B.V. but by S.-C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&amp;T, although &#13;
    both Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam are ex Shipinspec employees and Wirstam &#13;
    had actually been working under the head of the Stockholm office of Shipinspec, &#13;
    Ulf Beijner, who was now contacted by Forsberg/Hobro.</font></p>&#13;

      - born in 1944 - studied marine engineering at Chalmers University, Gothenburg &#13;
      from 1973-1977. Thereafter he joined Sjöfarts-verket and stayed for 13 years &#13;
      until 1990 when he became head of BV-Sweden. Anders Wirstam - born 1942 &#13;
      - testified to having had 28 years of experience when being interrogated &#13;
      in November 1994 and has been with Shipinspec Stockholm from 1966-1969 under &#13;
      Ulf Beijner. </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Forsberg and Hobro &#13;
    contacted Ulf Beijner, then still the head of Shipinspec's inspection office &#13;
    Stockholm, on 24.11.92. According to a memo made by Ulf Beijner after the &#13;
    meeting they outlined their plans to replace the NORD ESTONIA by the ESTONIA, &#13;
    including the new companies structures, flag of vessel, Estonian crew and &#13;
    time schedule. They also asked whether Shipinspec could assist B.V. in the &#13;
    take-over procedure which was promised. The respective memo by Ulf Beijner &#13;
    is attached - together with an office translation - as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.117.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    6.4.117. </a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly &#13;
    N&amp;T did not just request assistance for B.V. in general, but also requested &#13;
    that Shipinspec should carry out the so-called "2/90 inspection" after the &#13;
    take-over in Tallinn, which was also accepted. This "2/90 inspection" had &#13;
    then already been replaced by official "Regulation 1/92" which came into force &#13;
    on 15 April 1992 by order of the then head of Shipinspec, Safety Chief, Bengt-Erik &#13;
    Stenmark. Regulation 1/92 together with an office translation is attached &#13;
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.118.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.4.118</a>. &#13;
    It reveals that the main issue of this regulation is fire-fighting and lifeboat &#13;
    drills respectively the training of crews and passengers in respect of the &#13;
    above and it is quite obvious that this regulation had been drafted under &#13;
    the influence of the SCANDINAVIAN STAR catastrophe. It further reveals that &#13;
    the stated controls and exercises had and have to be carried out on all Swedish &#13;
    flag vessels and all other vessels calling at Swedish ports. In addition, &#13;
    it is required that passenger vessels regularly calling at Swedish ports have &#13;
    to undergo a "1/92 inspection" with acceptable results before the vessel takes &#13;
    up service. Whilst in service the vessel has to undergo continued inspections &#13;
    in intervals determined by Shipinspec, however, at least once a year.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Part of the Regulation &#13;
    1/92 are the attachments 1 and 2, i.e. the "Report", and the "Guidance to &#13;
    Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships". Both are attached &#13;
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.119.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 6.4.119</a> &#13;
    and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.120.htm" target="_blank">6.4.120</a>. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular &#13;
    the "Guidance to Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships", &#13;
    which draws attention to the negative role the human element has played in &#13;
    shipping disasters in the past, had been developed to avoid what did take &#13;
    place only 20 months later on board of MV ESTONIA, a vessel which had been &#13;
    "carefully" checked by inspectors of Shipinspec before taking up her trade &#13;
    and which thereafter had called at Stockholm every second day. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, &#13;
    in addition to those "inspections" the vessel had to be visited frequently &#13;
    by the Classification surveyor Anders Wirstam since ESTONIA participated in &#13;
    the "Continuous Survey System" of B.V., i.e. 1500 items had to be checked &#13;
    during 5 years, viz. 300 per year. For details see Subchapter 9.1.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Further on behalf &#13;
    of E.N.M.B. the same B.V. surveyor had to</font></p>&#13;

      SOLAS requirements.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously quite &#13;
    a substantial job for one man on a vessel like the ESTONIA. Further details &#13;
    can be found in Subchapter 9.2. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the companies' &#13;
    structure had been established and the basic agreements were made quite some &#13;
    activities developed between N&amp;T and B.V. in connection with ESTONIA's documentation/certification, &#13;
    and it became very obvious that N&amp;T behaved and was treated as if they were &#13;
    the owners. Nowhere in the relevant correspondence do E-Line, Estline or ESCO &#13;
    appear.<br/><b>Note:</b></font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the change &#13;
    of flag and also because Estonia is signatory to the SOLAS Convention the &#13;
    vessel had to comply with a number of amendments to SOLAS 1974, which she &#13;
    apparently did not or, at least, B.V. and N&amp;T were uncertain whether she did. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They found &#13;
    out, for example, that in 1985 the duck tail had been fitted and that at the &#13;
    end of 1990/beginning of 1991 ca. 85 ts. of steel plates had been built-in &#13;
    in way of the accommodation and that subsequently an inclining experiment &#13;
    was carried out by Ship Consulting Oy, Turku, because according to SOLAS - &#13;
    Chapter II-1, Regulation 22, paragraph 2, the following is required:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»2 Where any &#13;
      alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability &#13;
      information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall &#13;
      be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, since &#13;
    1991 SOLAS requires in paragraph 3 of the same regulation: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»3 At periodical &#13;
      intervals not exceeding five years, a lightweight survey shall be carried &#13;
      out on all passenger ships to verify any changes in lightship displacement &#13;
      and longitudinal centre of gravity. The ship shall be re-inclined whenever, &#13;
      in comparison with the approved stability information, a deviation from &#13;
      the lightship displacement exceeding 2% or a deviation of the longitudinal &#13;
      centre of gravity exceeding 1% of L is found or anticipated.«</i></font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the results &#13;
    of the inclining experiment carried out in January 1991 Ship Consulting Oy &#13;
    drew up a revised "Trim and Stability Booklet" dated 20.01.91, which was stamped &#13;

    It is based on the initial one provided by Meyer Werft for the newbuilding &#13;
    VIKING SALLY. Ship Consulting Oy, however, found that the centre of gravity &#13;
    (CG) - in their opinion - was too far astern which had the following consequences:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

      0.40 m; if the calculation was made on even keel the Amax value was below &#13;

    and manual side locks of the visor. This was acceptable from the point of &#13;
    view of the Load Line Convention because the "side casings" were considered &#13;
    to be closed structures above the bulkhead deck. Also SOLAS 1974 - II-1, Rule &#13;
    71 (margin line condition) excluded the theoretical flooding of the deck and &#13;
    therefore such openings remained without closures in those years. Moreover, &#13;
    as long as the visor remained weathertight no water could penetrate these &#13;
    openings anyway, because they were located inside the rubber packings of the &#13;
    visor at both front bulkheads. As soon as the visor started to "leak" and &#13;
    became filled with water, these openings became a problem because they extended &#13;
    from about 300 mm above the 3rd stringer level to the 2nd stringer level which &#13;
    is within the area of watermarks visible inside the visor. Behind the openings &#13;
    there was a void space located between A-deck and B-deck, which was accessible &#13;
    only through an opening in B-deck with a sill of 200 mm height, but without &#13;
    cover. It is unknown to this 'Group of Experts' whether the handwritten remark &#13;
    "to be dealt with" on the fax dated 28.03.94, i.e. 6 months before the casualty, &#13;

    relating to the time after the take-over are not strictly in line with the &#13;
    structuring of this report they have to be mentioned here already to demonstrate:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a)</b> the deep &#13;
    involvement of the B.V. head office, Paris and<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) </b>the &#13;
    obvious fact that B.V. and N&amp;T had some problems with the fulfilment of SOLAS &#13;
    requirements concerning stability criteria which were not solved at the time &#13;
    when the vessel sank. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary it can &#13;
    be concluded that B.V. and N&amp;T obviously still had serious problems after &#13;
    the vessel had been in her new service for more than 1 year. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a meeting &#13;
    with Capt. Hummel in July 1996 Veli Matti Junnila of Ship Consulting Oy, who &#13;
    had made the calculations for the old Trim &amp; Stability Manual dated 20.01.91 &#13;
    and who was working on the new one upon instructions of N&amp;T at the time of &#13;
    casualty, gave the following comments:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When rechecking &#13;
    the intact and damage stability in the light of the new requirements B.V. &#13;
    found out that the Centre of Gravity (CG) was too much astern. For this reason &#13;
    she had always stern trim.<br/>&#13;
    - To correct this and to reduce the swell in the archipelago, the duck tail &#13;
    was fitted, which indeed allowed a reduced stern trim and increased the GM &#13;
    because the waterline area was increased. Also the damage stability was improved &#13;
    because the duck tail created more buoyancy in damaged condition.<br/>&#13;
    - The problem, however, was the margin line which is a theoretical line 3 &#13;
    inches or 76 mm below bulkhead deck = car deck. This line must not be submerged &#13;
    in the final stage of the flooding of two compartments - a requirement since &#13;
    SOLAS 1965 - a condition which the ferry did fulfil only with stern trim.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As the first &#13;
    <i>Stability Booklet</i> as well as the second one issued 20.01.91, did not &#13;
    indicate the stern trim requirement and further, did not take into account &#13;
    the duck tail, the built-in 85 tons of steel and, finally, also the stabilisers, &#13;
    B.V. demanded a new <i>"Trim and Stability Booklet"</i> and declared the old &#13;
    one "preliminary".<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He was still &#13;
    working on this booklet when the casualty occurred.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The Stability &#13;
    Booklet of 20.01.91 is based on the actual inclining experiment of 11.01.91 &#13;
    when the duck tail was fitted and the 85 ts steel were built-in already. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> According &#13;
    to the amended SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Regulation 22, since 1991 passenger &#13;

    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.121.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.4.121</a>).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - That the cross-flooding &#13;
    valve between the heeling tanks 13 and 14 - a 500 mm butterfly valve operated &#13;

    were closed this valve opened automatically. Reportedly this connection had &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the SOLAS edition &#13;
    in force in January 1993, which included the SOLAS 1974 edition plus subsequent &#13;
    addenda, no Regulation 1 (c) in Chapter II can be found anymore, i.e. the &#13;
    B.V. form is based on an older edition of SOLAS 1974 when Reg. 1 (c) - which &#13;
    is now Regulation 1.4. - contained the following: </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>«Chapter &#13;
    II-1 <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Construction &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently it &#13;
    should have been obvious for B.V. that it was not possible to grant any exemption &#13;
    whatsoever as "the vessel proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land &#13;
    in the course of her voyage." As the wording of Regulation 1 (c) is more or &#13;
    less identical to Regulation 1.4. of the 1992 edition of SOLAS 1974 the application &#13;
    of the older form did not make a difference. <br/>&#13;
    The report continues with <b>item 2 - Survey of Hull and Machinery </b></font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This item is the &#13;
    only one, where the B.V. form does not quote any SOLAS Regulation.</font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Here B.V. correctly &#13;
    did not accept the "Stability Booklet" approved by the F.B.N., because there &#13;
    were indications that it could not comply with all requirements (see Subchapter &#13;
    6.4).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other &#13;
    hand B.V. accepted the structure of the vessel approved by F.B.N. including &#13;
    the location of the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead, &#13;
    although this was obviously not in accordance with the requirements of SOLAS &#13;
    because the ramp was visibly located too much forward. It did not require &#13;
    a detailed structural examination to find that out but just the knowledge &#13;
    of the structure of the vessel which a Classification Society should have &#13;
    after 12 years of attendance to a vessel built under its supervision! Knowledge &#13;
    of the relevant SOLAS requirements Mr. Olsson and the man from Paris definitely &#13;
    should have had, as the SOLAS rules had then already been part of the B.V. &#13;
    rules for about 10 years. B.V. now argues in defence that the vessel in her &#13;
    previous trade had also proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land - &#13;
    which is true for the leg Vaasa-Sundsvall - and thus they could assume that &#13;
    the structure had been approved by F.B.N. to be in conformity with SOLAS 1974 &#13;
    requirements.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> SOLAS Regulation &#13;
    12, however, requires:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»A certificate &#13;
      called a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate shall be issued after inspection &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">and Chapter II-1, &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The findings of &#13;
    the Sjöfartsverket inspectors - as far as available here - can be taken from &#13;
    the handwritten remarks made on pages A - J between 04.01.93 at Turku and &#13;
    21.01.93 in Tallinn and on 21.03.93, when the vessel was again in Turku. These &#13;
    remarks - 9 pages - are attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.126.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    6.5.2.126</a> and indicate that at least part of the relevant safety installations &#13;
    had not been in proper condition. It has to be assumed that the deficiencies &#13;
    were rectified prior to Sjöfartsverket approving the vessel, although some &#13;
    of the items either still existed or had reappeared when Åke Sjöblom and his &#13;
    colleague inspected the vessel with their trainees shortly before the last &#13;
    departure. See Chapter 15.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition to a &#13;
    large number of safety checks the Sjöfartsverket inspectors also had an "Operational &#13;
    Control" performed by the new crew of the ESTONIA which consisted of a <b>fire &#13;
    drill</b> and an <b>abandon ship drill</b>. Details can be taken from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.127.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    6.5.2.127</a> - Operational Control ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 2 February 1993 &#13;
    ESTONIA finally departed from Tallinn with representatives from authorities, &#13;
    B.V. and Sjöfartsverket on board. At sea a function test of ship and crew &#13;
    was successfully carried out and after 2 hours the voyage to Stockholm was &#13;
    resumed. ESTONIA looked perfect as can be seen from the following three photos. &#13;

    had some basic knowledge about the new vessel. Also some of the Swedish advisers &#13;

    Estonian captains, Anders Andersson, who had been sacked after repeated clashes &#13;

    of the department. Regarding personnel, maintenance and other operational &#13;
    matters he reported to ESCO via the master. His economic reporting was to &#13;
    Estline in Stockholm. There was a Swedish or Finnish adviser for the Estonian &#13;
    chief purser, who from the time of the take-over until July 1994 was Marlene &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">When the operation &#13;
    of the ESTONIA was taken over by ESCO in 1993, the new safety organisation &#13;
    was based on the safety plan of their previous vessel on the same route, the &#13;
    NORD ESTONIA.</font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All documents, plans &#13;
    and manuals included in the safety system were in both Estonian and English, &#13;
    and the safety organisation was implemented at all crew levels prior to commencement &#13;
    of traffic. The safety organisation was tested during the operational control &#13;
    in Tallinn before the ferry commenced trading, see Subchapter 6.2.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The safety organisation &#13;
    and the training and implementation thereof were described in the emergency &#13;
    plan, the safety manual and the training manual.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>Reportedly &#13;
      due to the fact that the NORD ESTONIA had no radio operator and consequently &#13;
      was not included in the safety plan, the radio operator of the ESTONIA - &#13;
      as well as all the Swedish/Finnish advisers - had no functions in the safety &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Various types &#13;
    of alarm were used on board the ESTONIA. The lifeboat alarm and fire alarm &#13;
    were general alarms, addressed to passengers and crew. Besides these there &#13;
    was a coded alarm <i>"Mr. Skylight"</i> addressed only to the crew and intended &#13;
    to alert relevant parts of the safety organisation. The alarms were described &#13;
    in the emergency plan and in the safety manual available at various locations &#13;
    in the crew accommodations such as mess rooms, day rooms and all major workplaces. &#13;
    The different alarms are explained as follows: </font></font></p>&#13;

    the helicopter groups. The chief purser was responsible for evacuation, the &#13;

    commenced her traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm, an operative control &#13;
    was carried out on board by the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, which has been described &#13;
    in Subchapter 6.5.2.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 2 February 1994 &#13;
    the ESTONIA also participated in a major bomb exercise, the RITS Övning. &#13;

    pool compartments half way between the Estonian and the Swedish coasts, i.e. &#13;
    approximately in the actual casualty position, was simulated. The purpose &#13;
    of this exercise was to train the co-operation between the shore-based, helicopter &#13;
    landed anti-terrorists experts with bomb dogs, etc. and the vessel's safety &#13;
    organisation.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The distance from &#13;
    Tallinn to Söderarm is 173 nm, to Sandhamn 177 nm. The distance from Söderarm &#13;
    to Frihamn, however, is 54 nm corresponding to 41/2 hours steaming time (in &#13;
    most parts of the archipelago the speed is restricted to 12 kn), whilst the &#13;
    distance from Sandhamn is only 42 nm corresponding to 3.5 hours steaming time. &#13;
    Therefore the Sandhamn route was preferred. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Assuming that &#13;
    ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on time (which was seldom the case) she was &#13;
    turned on outbound course at the earliest 15 minutes later, whereafter it &#13;
    needed some minutes to reach full speed (which is not taken into account). &#13;
    The ferry consequently had <b>14.75 hours</b> to reach Stockholm.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the &#13;
    Söderarm entrance had to be used she had available for the 173 nm long sea &#13;
    voyage 14.75 hours less 4.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>10.25 hours</b>, &#13;
    i.e. she had to make an average speed of <b>16.87</b> kn to be at the pilot &#13;
    station on time.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the &#13;
    Sandhamn entrance would be used, there was some more time because she had &#13;
    available 14.75 hours less 3.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>11.25 hours</b>, &#13;
    thus had to make an average speed of only <b>15.73 kn </b>to be on time at &#13;
    the pilot station.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An evaluation &#13;
    of the logbooks of the Stockholm pilots for the time between ESTONIA's first &#13;
    call on 03.02.93 and her last call on 26.09.94 revealed the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - During 20 months &#13;
      of service the ferry was only once delayed for 1 hour and that was on 1 &#13;
      January 1994 at the Sandhamn pilot station.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At Frihamn &#13;
      Terminal ESTONIA during the same period of time the ferry arrived late only &#13;
      8 times with max. delay of 24 minutes (also on 01.01.94).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- None of &#13;
      these delays could apparently be attributed to weather influence.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Delays &#13;
      occurred, however, generally upon departure from Stockholm, although only &#13;
      seldom of more than 20 minutes. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In total, &#13;
      the vessel departed from Stockholm 12 times with more than a 30-minute delay. &#13;
      It has to be assumed that it was worse in Tallinn, according to the reports &#13;
      of previous passengers. Pilot or harbour master logbooks from Tallinn, however, &#13;
      are not available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An examination of &#13;
    the logbook entries of the Stockholm Pilots Association for the three days, &#13;
    when according to the SMHI ESTONIA had met wind and sea state conditions comparable &#13;
    to those encountered during the night of the casualty, has revealed the following: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 5 February 1993 &#13;
    ESTONIA arrived at 05.59 hours at the Sandhamn Pilot, on 23 January 1994 at &#13;
    05.43 hours at Söderarm Pilot and on 6 March 1994 at 05.25 hours at Sandhamn &#13;
    Pilot. Consequently she was always on time. The respective logbook pages are &#13;
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.140.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures &#13;
    12.3.140</a>, <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.141.htm" target="_blank">12.3.141</a> &#13;
    .<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since no detailed &#13;
    information is available from the Estonian side and previous passengers frequently &#13;
    experienced considerable delays on arrival in Tallinn, the eastbound voyages &#13;
    cannot be evaluated.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, &#13;
    it is a fact that ESTONIA met at least 6 times similar or worse wind and wave &#13;
    conditions compared to those she met on the night of the accident, however, &#13;
    without delayed arrival (on the westbound voyages) and it is unknown whether &#13;
    damage to the visor and its locking devices were sustained. The last time &#13;
    she met similar conditions was only on 19 August 1994, i.e. 5 weeks before &#13;
    the casualty, and at this time all the disastrous deficiencies - as will be &#13;
    explained later on - were already existing. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation &#13;
    of the arrival times at the Stockholm Pilot stations outlined above also reveals &#13;
    that ESTONIA obviously always maintained her schedule, regardless of the prevailing &#13;
    weather and/or ice conditions. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation for &#13;
    this adherence to schedule by all means and under all circumstances can probably &#13;
    be found in</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the pride &#13;

      and Viking. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the pressure &#13;
      of competition from the large and more comfortable Stockholm-Helsinki ferries &#13;
      which - according to Ulf Hobro - was also the reason for the installation &#13;
      of stabilisers at high costs after less than 1 year in service. As a matter &#13;
      of fact Ulf Hobro had asked Turku Repair Yard already in the beginning of &#13;
      April 1993, i.e. after ESTONIA had been in service for just 2 months, but &#13;
      mainly in bad weather, to quote for the installation of stabilisers. The &#13;
      offer was submitted on 5 April 1993 and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.143.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
      12.3.143</a>.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The pressure on &#13;
    the masters of ESTONIA from the Board members of Estline AB is confirmed by &#13;
    the statement of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    5.3.111</a> - who has stated that during board meetings of Estline AB it had &#13;
    been repeatedly stressed that ESTONIA had to maintain her arrival at Stockholm &#13;
    by all means and that this had been made quite clear to the masters, who sometimes &#13;
    attended the board meetings. This is said to be written in the protocols of &#13;
    these board meetings which must be still available. The apparent fact that &#13;
    the masters of ESTONIA did their utmost to maintain the schedule was obviously &#13;
    not unknown to the crew as it is demonstrated by the questioning of motorman &#13;
    Ziljajev, who testified in this connection as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b><i>Q</i></b><i>: &#13;
    Was it a must or was it a requirement from the management that ESTONIA or &#13;
    any other vessel may not miss her schedule, i.e. be delayed?<br/><b>A:</b> With ESTONIA we were always on time. The master had a time schedule &#13;
    received from the owners and we were always on time. The masters always followed &#13;
    the schedule received from the company. According to contract he had to follow &#13;
    this schedule. <br/><b>Q:</b> You have now told us about the obligations of the master to follow &#13;
    the schedule. There are rumours that masters who are unable to keep the schedule &#13;
    will be sacked. <br/><b>A:</b> Yes, that is principally so. This is the requirement of the company &#13;
    that the master has to maintain the schedule. Some of the passengers have &#13;
    to reach other connections and if they miss them, because the vessel is delayed, &#13;
    the company has to pay compensation. <br/><b>Q:</b> Which company has worked out the schedule? <br/><b>A:</b> Estline AB. But I don't blame Estline for anything. Each company &#13;
    has its own schedule, where it is described up to the minute. If a company &#13;
    buys a ship, then it is not completely known how the vessel reacts during &#13;
    operation, how much power is needed, among other things, during a storm.</i></font></p>&#13;

    board ESTONIA by car. Upon arrival in Tallinn the crew was unable to open &#13;
    the bow ramp. It took one hour before they were able to open it by means of &#13;
    heavy hammers. (Why didn't they warm it up?) It was frozen fast. He has a &#13;

    Out of 6 trips, the last one on 12/13 June 1994, he and his wife saw 5 incidents &#13;
    when crew members were banging on the locking bolts of the bow ramp with sledge &#13;
    hammers. He recalls the upper starboard and lower port bolt. It took the crew &#13;
    10 minutes and more to open or close one bolt. They always drove on board &#13;
    among the first cars at Stockholm, thus were close to the bow ramp and could &#13;
    observe the activities of the crew rather closely. </font></li>&#13;

    - travelled on the ESTONIA in September 1994: The car deck was wet. Upon departure &#13;
    from Stockholm the crew was unable to close the visor. Quite a number of crew &#13;
    members were jumping around on the forecastle deck. Upon departure from Tallinn, &#13;
    one week later, the departure was delayed by 2 hours because the visor could &#13;
    not be closed. </font></li>&#13;

    In July 1994 two of his friends were travelling by bus from a place in Lithuania &#13;
    together with a couple of others via Tallinn on the ESTONIA to Stockholm for &#13;
    shopping. On the way back they had to wait for 3 hours in Tallinn before the &#13;
    crew was able to open the visor, which was only possible after some burning/cutting &#13;
    had taken place. They left the bus and went up to the 8th deck overlooking &#13;
    the forecastle deck from where they observed what the crew and subsequently &#13;
    also workers from ashore were doing. The statements of Anton Paulomo and his &#13;
    two friends will be available.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Gerhard Stenhammer</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> &#13;
    - a Stockholm pilot and now retired, had observed shortly before the casualty &#13;
    that after departure from Frihamn Terminal the crew tried to close the visor &#13;
    for 15 minutes by opening/closing with loud bangs until it became silent. &#13;
    The master explained that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. &#13;
    The pilot asked the master whether the locking devices would still fit and &#13;
    the answer was 'no problem'. In the opinion of pilot Stenhammer the visor &#13;
    was 'out of geometry'.</font></li>&#13;

    - was on board as a passenger with car the last week in July 1994. Their car &#13;
    was the last one to roll on board in Tallinn, the bow ramp was closed behind &#13;
    them and they were leaving the car when he realised that 2 crew members were &#13;
    trying to lock the starboard lower bolt of the bow ramp, which did not work. &#13;
    A third one came with an iron bar in his hand, was hammering a couple of times &#13;
    on the pocket, without the bolt moving at all, whereafter they turned round &#13;
    and walked away by saying: <i>"It can remain as it is"</i>, although the bolt &#13;
    was not locked. (He speaks and understands Estonian.) He has subsequently &#13;
    written a letter to Estline AB and complained about the above, whereafter &#13;
    he received a letter stating that the securing bolts and locking devices were &#13;
    the responsibility of a Finnish engineer company, the name of whom he also &#13;
    received. He wrote to them as well as to Det norske Veritas, but never received &#13;
    a reply. (The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.154.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    (trained as a shipyard welder) made more than 50 trips on the ESTONIA, lost &#13;
    his wife and children during the casualty.<br/>&#13;
    It was on 3 March 1994 when they arrived in Tallinn and when for the first &#13;
    time he noted that something was wrong with the ferry. His car was the second &#13;
    one from forward and he watched how the crew tried in vain to open the visor, &#13;
    he was nervous because he had to reach the Belorussian Embassy before they &#13;
    closed to obtain a visa. He speaks and understands the Estonian language, &#13;
    thus picked up from crew members talk that they were unable to unlock the &#13;
    side locks of the visor, he left his car and told the crew members to lift &#13;
    / lower / lift / lower, etc. the visor in short intervals and, when lowering, &#13;
    try to open the side locks simultaneously, they followed the advice and after &#13;
    about 30 minutes they finally managed to open the visor and subsequently also &#13;
    the bow ramp, which did not create problems. There was no ice in the port &#13;
    of Tallinn at the time, however, he seems to remember that there had been &#13;
    ice at sea.<br/>&#13;
    Later, probably on 27 March 1994 he was again on his way to Tallinn when the &#13;
    same happened, but this time it took the crew only 15-20 minutes to open the &#13;
    visor.<br/>&#13;
    He had the definite impression that the visor was totally misaligned and did &#13;
    not fit anymore into the locking devices. The interview is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.155.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;

        next to the hydraulic pump controls which were at port side. <br/>&#13;
        They had a problem with the system and alleged that the ramp was frozen &#13;
        fast.<br/>&#13;
        The Estonian crew members tried to open the bow ramp in vain for about &#13;
        20 minutes by operating the hydraulic different ways, then started to &#13;
        hammer against the what he believed were the securing bolts, also in vain, &#13;
        then they asked the Swedish adviser to come down and he believes it was &#13;
        Karl Karell. He stepped out of the car, shook hands with him and said: &#13;
        'Why do the Estonians switch off the hydraulic system at sea?' He shrugged &#13;
        and said something like "one year with Estonians is more than enough", &#13;
        but he did something whereafter it was possible for the crew to open the &#13;
        bow ramp and they left the ferry.«</font></i></p>&#13;

        Finally crew members brought 2 gas bottles plus burning gear to the door &#13;

        crew members. I saw sparks falling down further forward and after some &#13;
        time visor and bow ramp opened. The bow ramp could only be opened or closed &#13;

    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»I have actually &#13;
        seen crew members working at the bow ramp many times by hammering, welding &#13;
        or cutting (burning). I have seen the gas bottles and considered it to &#13;
        be very dangerous. As I am quite familiar with the way the crews from &#13;
        ex Eastern Block countries work, I was, however, not too surprised. It &#13;
        was clearly visible that the bow ramp was severely misaligned respectively &#13;
        bent. In open condition the port side was much lower compared to the starboard &#13;
        side. The bow ramp could not be opened in one go, but had to be raised/lowered &#13;
        several times before it was finally down.<br/>&#13;
        Before the ramp was lowered down completely to the quay two crew members &#13;
        jumped on the quay and rolled one or two rope coils underneath the starboard &#13;
        side of the ramp, which was still 30-40 cm above the quay when the port &#13;
        side was already resting on it. I remember also to have seen that wooden &#13;
        pallets were placed underneath the starboard side of the bow ramp instead &#13;
        of the rope coils.<br/>&#13;
        I am also of the opinion that, at least during the last months before &#13;
        the catastrophe, the bow ramp could not be closed completely anymore, &#13;
        because several times I observed from my position at the fore part of &#13;
        the car deck that light was falling on to the car deck as soon as the &#13;
        visor began to open, i.e. before the bow ramp itself was even moved. This, &#13;
        in my opinion, is only possible if the bow ramp was already open to a &#13;
        certain extent when the visor opened. The light came in at the upper port &#13;
        side. The whole ramp was badly misaligned, in particular the port side &#13;
        looked very bad, whilst the starboard side looked quite in order. Once &#13;
        I saw a crew member standing on a wooden pallet which was lifted up by &#13;
        a forklift standing behind the closed bow ramp at port side. The man was &#13;
        lifted up to a position just underneath what I believe was the upper bolt. &#13;
        After some hammering to the area where the bolt was located the man was &#13;
        lowered down to the car deck again. <br/>&#13;
        I also remember more or less always having seen a large number of wooden &#13;
        pallets on the car deck, which were stowed behind the side houses at both &#13;
        sides. <br/>&#13;
        On my last trip to Tallinn before the casualty (I missed one sailing) &#13;
        my car was on the hanging deck at starboard side. Thus I could not see &#13;
        what was going on at the ramp and the visor when being opened. I saw, &#13;
        however, crew members working at the bow ramp before it was lowered down. &#13;
        When I drove down the ramp I saw the equipment for either welding or burning &#13;
        (gas bottles) laying at port side near ramp. We had to wait longer than &#13;
        normal, maybe half an hour or more before the bow ramp opened. I remember &#13;
        this clearly, because I had people waiting for me at the quay who had &#13;
        left before I was from board because it took so long. It could be the &#13;
        time <b>when I saw the visor moving up and down several times before the &#13;
        bow ramp opened combined with banging noises and also hammering.</b>«</i></font></p>&#13;

        the ferry in Stockholm and were the last people to come onboard, because &#13;
        we had first gone to the wrong terminal. As we were late the ship left &#13;
        straight away. After we had settled down in the cabin, I believe on the &#13;
        6th deck, which was overlooking the foreship, I went to the window and &#13;
        looked down onto the foreship while the vessel was proceeding through &#13;
        the archipelago. I immediately had the impression that it was a very old &#13;
        vessel in a bad condition. I saw a couple of empty foundations where the &#13;
        parts belonging on top, e.g. mooring winches and the like, had been taken &#13;
        away. I had a rather negative impression from the beginning, also that &#13;
        apparently a lot of paint layers were used without taking care for what &#13;
        was underneath. I also noted that the mooring ropes were substantially &#13;
        worn and in a bad condition. They looked simply worn and over-stretched. &#13;
        <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I &#13;
        also saw two crew members on the port side of the forecastle deck. The &#13;
        bigger man was standing on the visor facing me and was hammering with &#13;
        a big sledge hammer on the port edge of the visor which was extending &#13;
        the forepeak deck by some 10 cm. The gap was in any event big enough so &#13;
        that I showed it to my wife. We could see the water through the gap. The &#13;
        other man was standing on the forecastle deck opposite to the one with &#13;
        the sledge hammer and I could only see his back side. The visor was obviously &#13;
        not properly closed because its port side was standing upwards above the &#13;
        level of the forecastle deck, worse at the port outer corner on which &#13;
        the crew member was hammering, apparently without success, as far as I &#13;
        remember.<br/>&#13;
        The window could only be opened by force. I also checked the nearest way &#13;
        to the rescue station. I think we stayed in the cabin for about 1 hour, &#13;
        after some time the hammering stopped but the visor edge was still standing &#13;
        up.«</font></i></p>&#13;

        weather was now worse, according to my own notes ca. 22 m/s from East, &#13;
        with rough seas. I boarded the ferry about 1,5 nm outside Remmargrunds &#13;

        Read the article and draw your own conclusions.<br/>&#13;
        For me, having read his statement, it is a further confirmation that the &#13;

        He made it quite clear that the causes of the catastrophe are exclusively &#13;
        technical. <br/>&#13;
        Why is the excessive speed not taken into account?<br/>&#13;
        In interviews and statement by the Estonian members of the JAIC it is &#13;
        said that the speed is of no relevance and had no effect on the catastrophe.<br/>&#13;

        about all the deficiencies that had been on the vessel, why were these &#13;
        obvious deficiencies not rectified when the vessel changed flags to Estonia? &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        The vessel was for a longer time sailing under Estonian flag and it should &#13;
        very well have been noted that the ramp was at the wrong place. <br/>&#13;
        Or didn't they have competent masters and superintendents who were able &#13;
        to find that out?<br/>&#13;
        According to the Estonian newspapers one of the conclusions in the Final &#13;
        Report shall be that the speed had no relevance for the catastrophe, which &#13;
        is totally wrong and not understandable because the vessel was proceeding &#13;
        with full engine power against a full storm. Many people, who do not even &#13;
        have own experience with good seamanship, will laugh about it. Already &#13;
        in the autumn (1995) the public has pointed to the fact that the Estonian &#13;
        Commission is biased. This is true, but the required consequences have &#13;
        not been taken.<br/>&#13;
        The Commission itself does everything to make the Final Report, which &#13;
        is of substantial international interest, a farce, which is absolutely &#13;
        impossible.<br/>&#13;
        Forsberg did indeed state in yesterday's 'Svenska Dagbladet' that the &#13;
        survivors had been questioned by the police. I am asking you, Hans: Is &#13;
        it possible for an external, who has never had to do with shipping or &#13;
        with how to handle a vessel, to ask the proper questions to establish &#13;
        a correct picture (scenario) of what had happened?«</font></i></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Generally the information &#13;
    available from on board is restricted to the observations of passengers as &#13;
    basically reported in Chapter 12.4, because the crew members had been forbidden &#13;
    by their employer ESCO to talk about ESTONIA at all. Only very few have talked, &#13;
    although very carefully, as will be explained on the following pages.</font><br/><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has also been very &#13;
    difficult to obtain information from N&amp;T/Hornet AB/ Estline or ESCO. Apart &#13;
    from the discussion with Ulf Hobro during the first meeting with the JAIC &#13;
    in Stockholm in February 1995, there are only some details available from &#13;
    the files of the public prosecutor and from those of the JAIC, which will &#13;
    also be discussed subsequently. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>1. Maintenance</b> &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was drydocked &#13;
    at Turku between<b> 4-8 January 1993</b> and the necessary inspections were &#13;
    carried out. At this time also some maintenance work was performed which had &#13;
    been partly ordered by the old owners, Wasa Line, and partly by the technical &#13;
    managers of the new owners, N&amp;T, as outlined in detail in Subchapter 6.5.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently in &#13;
    January 1993 during the time at the yard:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>a)</b> the locking &#13;
    devices of visor and bow ramp were neither serviced nor strengthened, and &#13;
    <br/><b>b)</b> the outer hinges of the bow ramp were not serviced nor were the &#13;
    bushings and bolts renewed, and<br/><b>c)</b> 15 m of the rubber packings of the visor and 10 m of the rubber &#13;
    packings of the bow ramp were not renewed. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (a):<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the &#13;
    crew was unable to service and strengthen <b>the locking devices of visor &#13;
    and bow ramp</b>, they were never serviced and strengthened until the casualty. &#13;
    Since the crew was also unable to service the hinges of the bow ramp and to &#13;
    renew the bushings and bolts, in particular the port outer hinge, it is a &#13;
    fact that nothing was done to rectify the poor condition of - at least - the &#13;
    port outer bow ramp hinge. It is, however, known from Börje Stenström, head &#13;
    of the technical group of JAIC, that the crew had put the damaged port outer &#13;
    bow ramp hinge on the repair list a number of times, but that repairs were &#13;
    postponed by the technical managers until the next scheduled yard stay, probably &#13;
    in January 1995. The respective memo is attached as Enclosure 12.5.166. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (b): </b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>visor &#13;
    hinges </b>required professional maintenance which the crew was apparently &#13;
    also unable to provide, because according to the testimony of the 2nd engineer &#13;
    Peeter Tüür in June 1996, who is responsible for the technical functioning &#13;
    of visor and bow ramp - the crew had problems to have the hinges properly &#13;
    greased and even had <b>to add oil to the grease to ensure that the grease &#13;
    reached all parts to be lubricated </b>- see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.167.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.167</a>. Needless to say that the effect of grease is destroyed by adding &#13;
    oil. Due to the severely misaligned visor the hinges could no more be properly &#13;
    lubricated. This resulted in excessive wear of the bronze bushings which consequently &#13;
    had to be renewed.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Such renewal &#13;
    is normally effected by drilling out the steel and bronze bushing by means &#13;
    of a particular milling installation in order to avoid damage to the hinge &#13;
    plates, which would be created if the bushings would be burned out. Whereas &#13;
    drilling, including proper welding of new bushings, takes about 2 days in &#13;
    port - whilst the visor is detached from the vessel and the vessel thus has &#13;
    to be taken out of service - burning is much faster, however, is combined &#13;
    with a loss of material of the hinge plates, the creating of deep burning &#13;
    marks, each of which is a crack starter. It is obvious that such damage to &#13;
    the hinge plates reduced their weight carrying capacity and furthermore increased &#13;
    the propagation of fatigue cracks in the hinge plates. For further details &#13;
    see Subchapter 34.3. Although denied by the technical managers and crew, the &#13;
    steel bushings of both visor hinges were evidently burned out and replaced &#13;
    by new steel and bronze bushings which, however, were fitted in a very unprofessional &#13;
    way. This will be further explained in Subchapter 34.3. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (c):</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On one hand &#13;
    the responsible inspector in the organisation of the technical managers, N&amp;T, &#13;
    Ulf Hobro, stated before the JAIC on 17 February 1995:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»... we did &#13;
      not care for the rubber packings, we have never renewed any of them nor &#13;
      was it ever our intention to do so. The visor was full of water at sea and &#13;
      this was known to everybody.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, &#13;
    Lennart Klevberg, in charge of spare parts with N&amp;T, did testify to the criminal &#13;
    police Stockholm, that </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»rubber packings &#13;
      for the visor had been ordered but were not installed because Capt. Andresson &#13;
      and Tomas Rasmusson had decided to wait until MARE BALTICUM would be taken &#13;
      over in order to do the replacement on both ferries simultaneously.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This does not make &#13;
    much sense, however, based on the underwater videos it is indeed a fact that &#13;
    the rubber packings of the visor were missing from forward of the Atlantic &#13;
    lock along the whole port side and about 1 m up the front bulkhead, whilst &#13;
    at the starboard side there were some rubber packings from forward of the &#13;
    Atlantic lock to the "corner of the mouth", which was empty up to ca. 2 m &#13;
    of the front bulkhead. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious &#13;
    that the visor was no more weathertight and thus full of water at sea up to &#13;
    the outboard level as evident from the watermarks inside of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>2. Damage and &#13;
    Repairs</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The crew also denied &#13;
    ever having carried out repairs to the visor, the bow ramp and/or to their &#13;
    locking devices. This is true as far as the major repairs are concerned which &#13;
    would have been necessary to bring the visor back into proper shape and alignment, &#13;
    but which were never carried out. The crew, however, is wrong as far as numerous &#13;
    smaller repairs and rectifications to the visor, the bow ramp and their locking &#13;
    devices are concerned which were frequently performed to avoid the worst and &#13;
    keep visor and bow ramp best terms possible in workable condition. This had &#13;
    been observed by many passengers as outlined in Chapter 12.4. and was even &#13;
    admitted by crew members, for example by the safety officer Ervin Roden who &#13;
    told Spiegel TV on 02.05.97, among other things:<i> "Something was always &#13;
    being repaired on board. There was always welding work being carried out. &#13;
    I am uncertain whether also to the visor. But everywhere repairs were carried &#13;
    out, also in the area of visor and bow ramp and also by the Finns."</i> The &#13;
    complete interview is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.168.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.168. </a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apart from &#13;
    the damages existing already when the ferry was taken over from the previous &#13;
    owners and which were not repaired by the new owners/ managers, it is quite &#13;
    obvious that the ferry sustained more damage to the visor and consequently &#13;
    also to its fixing points, the hinges and locking devices, when for example &#13;
    forcing ice at excessive speed as observed by various passengers. The observation &#13;
    repeated below is just one example: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of such &#13;
    reckless navigation are clearly visible on the large photo on the previous &#13;

    the Gulf of Finland and the Northern and Middle Baltic where more or less &#13;
    continuously covered by ice (see Subchapter 12.4.2), were roughly repaired &#13;
    by replacing parts of shell plating and bottom of the visor in Tallinn whilst &#13;
    the vessel remained in service. The renewed parts are still visible on the &#13;
    visor. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is also confirmed &#13;
    by the observation of the passenger Christer Eriksson, who reported the following: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

      to Tallinn on the "Estonia" on 3/4 May 1994 and left the vessel only at &#13;
      about 10.30 hours when all the other passengers had already gone ashore. &#13;
      The gangway was pulled in and I had to go ashore via the car deck and bow &#13;
      ramp. When I came down on the car deck I noticed a curtain of sparks falling &#13;
      down from the open visor on to the bow ramp and I managed to jump through &#13;
      it and saw on the bow ramp a giant red transformer turned 90° towards the &#13;
      ramp which in my opinion was Red Army surplus. Cables were running up to &#13;
      the port side of the forecastle deck/visor, where obviously heavy burning/ &#13;

    that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. The pilot asked the &#13;

    1994 the crew was unable to open the visor in spite of all sorts of attempts. &#13;
    Finally crew members brought two gas bottles plus burning gear to the door &#13;

    that the visor was partly open and that the bow ramp was down. He saw the &#13;

</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>3. The Bow Ramp</b> &#13;
    was the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck and &#13;
    as such had to be mandatorily weathertight. Therefore the ramp required regular &#13;
    maintenance of the rubber packings, the hinge arrange-ment and the locking &#13;
    devices. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before &#13;
    10 m of the rubber packings should have been renewed already during the yard &#13;
    time in January 1993, however, this was never done up to the casualty. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers &#13;
    to the locking devices of the bow ramp which should have been serviced and &#13;
    strengthened already in January 1993, which was also never done. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst damaged &#13;
    and missing rubber packings cause a bow ramp which is otherwise in proper &#13;
    condition to leak, this becomes much worse if the bow ramp is visibly misaligned &#13;
    and twisted. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This had been &#13;
    the case on ESTONIA for several months before the casualty and the condition &#13;
    deteriorated as time went by. It is a fact that water was penetrating the &#13;
    bow ramp already in 1993 according to the evidence of passengers and pilots. &#13;
    In particular the statement of the Stockholm pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.4.161</a> - is striking.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following drawing &#13;
    clearly demonstrates that already in calm sea the water rose above the 3rd &#13;
    stringer inside the also severely leaking visor due to the height of the bow &#13;
    wave at full speed. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg305.jpg" width="437" height="396"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the lower part &#13;
    of the deck opening with the missing and/or damaged rubber packings (see arrow &#13;
    on drawing) was below the 3rd stringer level of the closed visor, it is obvious &#13;
    that water penetrated the car deck already in calm sea when the vessel was &#13;
    on full speed (height of bow wave ca. 2.5 m). It is also obvious that the &#13;
    water inside the visor rose when the vessel was pitching in head seas. The &#13;
    height of the water inside the visor depended on the height of the outside &#13;
    water level, i.e. when the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle &#13;
    for a certain time the visor would fill up more or less completely with respective &#13;
    water pressure on the leakage of the bow ramp.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since absolutely &#13;
    nothing had been done to improve the condition of the rubber packings and &#13;
    also no maintenance to the bow ramp had taken place since the vessel was put &#13;
    under Estonian flag, also the condition of the ramp hinges, in particular &#13;
    the port outer one, deteriorated continuously. This process was being sped &#13;
    up by the wrong loading of the car deck through the also apparently in this &#13;
    respect rather inexperienced Estonian officers, because the vessel frequently &#13;
    had a list during loading/unloading when the heavy trucks were rolling on/off &#13;
    board via the bow ramp and the effect on the already pre-damaged and weakened &#13;
    hinges of the bow ramp was disastrous. This finally led to the complete destruction &#13;
    of the port outer hinge and the breaking of the inner lug connecting the ramp &#13;
    to the vessel, whilst the outer lug slid off the hinge bolt apparently after &#13;
    the securing plate was broken off. The result is explained by a truck driver &#13;
    who witnessed this incident as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I drove on &#13;
      board as one of the last trucks and after leaving my truck I saw that the &#13;
      crew tried to close the bow ramp, which was not possible because only the &#13;
      starboard side came up while the port side remained down. Only after several &#13;
      ups and downs of the ramp and some other things done by the crew did they &#13;
      finally manage to close the ramp. Ever since then the ramp was visibly twisted &#13;
      and when the visor opened and the bow ramp was still "closed", light fell &#13;
      in through the upper left corner.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above is based &#13;
    on a telephone conversation in December 1997. It has not yet been possible &#13;
    to take the statement of the truck driver.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This severe damage &#13;
    to the port outer hinge and to the ramp itself was reported by the crew to &#13;
    the technical managers and also put on the repair list several times according &#13;
    to Börje Stenström (see Enclosure 12.5.166). However, nothing was done to &#13;
    rectify this damage despite the fact that it constituted a severe violation &#13;
    of the SOLAS - and Class - requirements because evidently the open car deck &#13;
    was, via the leaking bow ramp, connected to the visor which at sea was filled &#13;
    with water.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As no maintenance &#13;
    took place the crew tried to seal the leaks as best they could by putting &#13;
    mattresses, blankets and rags into the openings between the ramp and car deck/bulkhead &#13;
    at the port lower corner. As a further consequence of the detached port lower &#13;
    side of the bow ramp the port lower securing bolt no longer fitted into the &#13;
    ramp pocket, whilst the upper port bolt fitted only to a limited extent and &#13;
    it is doubtful whether the port ramp hook was able to engage the lug at the &#13;
    ramp side at all.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These very severe &#13;
    deficiencies led to continuous problems for the crew when opening and closing &#13;
    the bow ramp and/or the locking devices which had been observed by many passengers, &#13;
    in particular by the truck drivers using the ferry twice a week or more as &#13;
    summarised in Chapter 12.4. These observations prove that the bow ramp as &#13;
    well as its locking devices had been in a very poor state of maintenance and &#13;
    that they no more fulfilled the SOLAS and the Class requirements.</font></p>&#13;

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I'm not quite &#13;
        certain of the exact date, but one afternoon after half past four I was &#13;
        busy with painting the bow visor on the deck. As the bow is in raised &#13;
        position only in Tallinn, I was painting the part that was otherwise not &#13;
        visible. Before painting I had also polished and primed the visor. While &#13;
        painting, I once again could not help noticing the cracks in the bow visor &#13;
        fastenings, which were the result of the fatigue of metal. When repainting &#13;
        the bow visor, I noticed them too. The cracks were visible only with the &#13;
        bow in raised position. The starboard side fastening mechanism/box of &#13;
        the visor had a crack of nearly 10 cm in length. The port side one had &#13;
        a 6 cm long crack. There was also a crack in the welding between the bow &#13;
        visor and the fastening beam, which was about 2 cm long. I am prepared &#13;
        to show the location of the cracks on drawings.«</i></font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: When were observations &#13;
    made of cracks in the visor of "Estonia"? <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: I &#13;
    observed them while painting on the bow deck of the "Estonia" in early August &#13;
    1994. Painting was done in the port of Tallinn.<br/>&#13;
    Q: In what position was the visor when you were working? <br/>&#13;
    A: The visor was open, otherwise we could not have seen the cracks.<br/>&#13;
    Q: What colours did you paint? <br/>&#13;
    A: Both green and white (i.e. both the deck surface and areas rising from &#13;
    the deck).<br/>&#13;
    Q: Can you show on the visor where the cracks were?<br/>&#13;
    A: Those parts have been removed, this is why I cannot show the crack locations.</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> &#13;
    (Upon instructions of Börje Stenström the hinge remains had been removed for &#13;
    metallographic investigations and mechanical testing already in January, that &#13;
    is why the crack locations could not be demonstrated.) <br/><i>Q: Could you indicate on these sketches where the cracks were?<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: You &#13;
    have to look from forward to aft at the hinges to be able to see the cracks &#13;
    in the welding seams between the bushings and the hinge plates of the visor &#13;
    hinges (hinges at the visor). The cracks were opposite to the deck when the &#13;
    visor was closed. At the starboard hinge there were cracks in both welds. &#13;
    At port side there was only one crack in the weld. The drawing below shows &#13;
    the location and approximate length of the cracks. </font></i></p>&#13;

<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b> Interview by &#13;
    Spiegel TV in April 1996 </b></font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: Could you tell &#13;
    us a bit more in detail about the paint work and the damage to the visor?<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: Actually &#13;
    the damage could only be seen when the visor was open. There were very many. &#13;
    On a drawing one could see that more in detail. Actually at one side there &#13;
    were these cracks. Possibly as a result of mechanical action.<br/>&#13;
    Q: You said on one side the crack was 10 cm long and on the other side about &#13;
    6 cm long? This is written in your statement.<br/>&#13;
    A: This might have been so.<br/>&#13;
    Q: Quite sometime has passed but I assume that you are not going to withdraw &#13;
    your written statement?<br/>&#13;
    A: No.<br/>&#13;
    A: I did not inform the boatswain about my observations. It was the time when &#13;
    the cars were rolling on board. And the boatswain ... you had to work with &#13;
    him. He did observe exactly. He disliked it if somebody did not work during &#13;
    his working time. Then I did not get a chance to tell him. I was actually &#13;
    of the opinion that it was known anyway. Therefore I forgot to report it.<br/>&#13;
    Q: What was the condition of the visor when you started to work?<br/>&#13;
    A: I did not have specific instructions to do something at a particular location. &#13;
    During my work I was climbing everywhere, cleaned and painted. This location &#13;
    was difficult to reach. Presumably the last time this area had been painted &#13;
    was when the vessel was painted white for the first time. I thought that certainly &#13;
    somebody from the administration knew about the cracks because the vessel &#13;
    was checked quite often. Also the boatswain checked our work. Therefore I &#13;
    believe that certainly somebody knew of the cracks.<br/>&#13;
    Q: Thus you were convinced that due to the frequent checks that somebody knew &#13;
    about the condition of the visor and also of the cracks? <br/>&#13;
    A: Yes, I was sure that they knew it. <br/>&#13;
    Q: Did the crack appear only after you had removed the paint? <br/>&#13;
    A: No, the crack was visible already before.<br/>&#13;
    Q: It was consequently enough to climb there to see the crack?<br/>&#13;
    A: Yes. </font></i></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of these &#13;
    three statements it has to be concluded that the welding seams between the &#13;
    bushings and hinge plates of the visor hinges were visibly cracked up to 10 &#13;
    cm at the beginning of August 1994, less than 8 weeks before the casualty.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The photo below &#13;
    shows a part cut out of the bushing recovered by divers from the wreck. It &#13;
    is most probably the starboard inner bushing as will be explained in Chapter &#13;
    30.</font></p>&#13;

    of stb. inner bushing recovered by divers</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding, &#13;
    the relevant parts have been numbered as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 = steel bushing &#13;
      <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2 = hinge &#13;

      between hinge plate/bushing<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 = welding &#13;
      material <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 = arrow &#13;
      pointing to the large gap between bushing and hinge plate <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">6 = welding &#13;
      seams between bushing/hinge plate</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Without going too &#13;
    much into detail, already now attention has to be drawn to some very obvious &#13;
    irregularities, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The bushing had &#13;
    been too small for the bore of the hinge plate (2), therefore a gap (5) remained &#13;
    between bushing and inner surface of the hinge plate. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding &#13;
    seams (6) are rather weak compared to the dimension of hinge plate and bushing. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There had &#13;
    obviously been a crack at the left side in the welding seam (4) which had &#13;
    been tried to be closed by welding. This led to the accumulation of welding &#13;
    material inside the gap between bushing / hinge plate. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The surface &#13;
    area between hinge plate/bushing (3) is severely corroded which would not &#13;
    have been possible if the inside had been airtight by intact welding seams. &#13;
    In other words, the apparent fact that the space between bushing/hinge plate &#13;
    could be attacked by corrosion as found is proof that the welding seams had &#13;
    been cracked over the full thickness for a longer time already. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) That there was &#13;
    something seriously wrong at least with the starboard hinge arrangement of &#13;
    the visor well before the casualty becomes very obvious when having a close &#13;
    look at the<b> video film made by a passenger upon departure from Tallinn &#13;
    on 17 September 1994</b>, i.e. 10 days before ESTONIA's last sailing. He stood &#13;
    on the open forepart of the 8th deck and with his video camera filmed the &#13;
    closing of the visor. Thereby he zoomed in on the starboard hinge arrangement. &#13;
    The subsequent evaluation of the video proved that the starboard visor hinges &#13;
    were totally misaligned with the lower part of the outer bushing as well as &#13;
    the securing plate missing. The video was analysed and evaluated in detail &#13;
    by the Reconnaissance Expert Bryan Roberts of Churchgate/UK and his report &#13;
    is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.180. </a></font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Although the distortion &#13;
    and misalignment of the starboard hinge is clearly visible to everybody, the &#13;
    Swedish part of JAIC gave a copy of the film to the Military Intelligence &#13;
    Service, who produced the picture attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.181.1</a>, which evidently shows the same. Nevertheless, the Intelligence &#13;
    people declared the whole film to be unreliable since 5 out of about 800 sequences &#13;
    had been slightly "jumping", which was accepted by the JAIC as well as N&amp;T &#13;
    and the film from then on was ignored by the JAIC and consequently is also &#13;
    not mentioned in their Report. What the film really shows becomes clear on &#13;
    the enlargement below, viz. some major deficiencies:</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg325.jpg" width="265" height="226"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the gap between &#13;
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (Arrow &#13;
    1).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the outer &#13;
    bushing is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (Arrow &#13;
    2) (which explains the large gap mentioned above).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the lower &#13;
    part of outer bushing is missing. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the securing &#13;
    plate is missing and the outer end of the bolt is not visible. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the outer &#13;
    bushing appears to be twisted anti-clockwise. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the inner &#13;
    bushing appears to be twisted anti-clockwise.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Bearing in mind &#13;
    that the nautical student Rain Oolmets reported the cracks observed at the &#13;
    beginning of August 1994 immediately after he had learned of the casualty &#13;
    to his uncle, who was then sailing as chief officer for ESCO, and the uncle &#13;
    went to the police who subsequently interrogated the student on 03.10.94, &#13;
    it is difficult to believe that Rain Oolmets had remained silent on the real &#13;
    damage to the starboard hinge, had it been there already.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, &#13;
    he had told Klaus Rahka during the questioning at Hangö on 24.03.95 that he &#13;
    had painted the visor hinges green and white and - as clearly visible on the &#13;
    video image on the following page showing the starboard hinge bolt - there &#13;
    is quite a lot of green paint on the bolt which could not possibly have got &#13;
    there as long as the hinges were in their original, intact condition because &#13;
    then it was practically a closed system, i.e. paint could not reach the bolt. &#13;
    The intact system has no gap as can be seen from the drawing below showing &#13;
    the intact starboard hinge arrangement.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg326.jpg" width="457" height="164"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it is, however, &#13;
    obvious from the video print below, showing the starboard bolt - without bushing &#13;
    - resting on the rail bar, there is a stripe of green paint at the bolt. Measurements &#13;
    reveal that the paint is in way of the gap between the outer bushing and the &#13;
    vessel hinge plate which is visible on the enlarged video print on the previous &#13;
    page (Arrow 1).</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg327.jpg" width="298" height="205"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore it has &#13;
    to be concluded that the gap must have been there already when the green paint &#13;
    was applied, however, this will be evaluated more in detail in Chapter 29/30. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Oolmets commenced &#13;
    his job mid July 1994 and left the vessel on the 11 September 1994. He had &#13;
    discovered up to 10 cm long cracks in the weldings between bushings and visor &#13;
    hinge plates both at port side and starboard side of the visor hinges when &#13;
    the visor was open. This was in early August, at a time after 16.30 hours &#13;
    when the loading of the trucks had already commenced. The boatswain then on &#13;
    board was Vello Ruben, thus it was the Andresson crew. Considering the fact &#13;
    that the Andresson and Piht crews relieved each other every 14 days, further &#13;
    that the Andresson crew would have been relieved on the 29.09.94, thus came &#13;
    on board on 15 September 1994, going back from that date in 14-day intervals, &#13;
    it becomes obvious that the early August time for the Andresson crew with &#13;
    Vello Ruben as boatswain ended on 4 August 1994 in Tallinn. As on that day &#13;
    the crews would change in the morning, the loading of the trucks after 16.30 &#13;
    hrs was already attended by the boatswain of the relief crew, Heino Leik. &#13;
    As on the day before, 3 August 1994, the vessel had been in Stockholm, it &#13;
    has to be concluded that Rain Oolmets found the cracks on<b> 2 August 1994 &#13;
    </b>as this is the only day in early August when Vello Ruben was on the car &#13;
    deck after 16.30 hours. The Andresson crew returned on 18 August 1994, but &#13;
    this date or later would hardly be considered early August by Rain Oolmets. &#13;
    On 11 September 1994 he left the vessel (see time schedule of crew change &#13;
    -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.182.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.182</a>).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If he had finished &#13;
    painting the starboard hinges, which has to be assumed as he stayed on board &#13;
    for another 6 weeks after discovery of the cracks in early August, there must &#13;
    have been quite a gap between the inside of the outer visor hinge plate and &#13;
    the outside of the outer hinge plate at the vessel's side, as otherwise it &#13;
    would not have been possible for such green deck paint to reach the bolt.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This could &#13;
    indicate that the repairs to the starboard hinges of the visor had already &#13;
    been carried out when Rain Oolmets discovered the reported cracks on 2 August &#13;
    1994. It would, of course, mean that he told the criminal police as well as &#13;
    JAIC only part of the truth, which would not be surprising.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> c.) According to &#13;
    the statement of<b> 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür</b> he was also responsible for &#13;
    all watertight (weathertight) openings of the vessel, their maintenance and &#13;
    proper functioning. In his statement taken on 3 October 1994 by the Estonian &#13;

      openings and to keep the technical functioning in order. It was also my &#13;
      responsibility to see that the visor was in order, but I was specifically &#13;
      responsible for the hydraulic of the visor. The closing of the visor was &#13;
      carried out by the boatswain, however, I am unaware who was directly responsible &#13;
      for the closing, possibly the mate. <b>Behind the visor is the ramp. This &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was initially &#13;
    the intention of this 'Group of Experts' to ignore the different statements &#13;
    made by <b>Silver Linde </b>completely because his "evidence" had obviously &#13;
    been influenced by his ESCO superiors, in particular by Enn Neidre, the head &#13;
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO and safety adviser of Estline and simultaneously &#13;
    member of the Estonian part of the JAIC until April 1996, whereafter he remained &#13;
    to be an expert to JAIC. An example of this is Silver Linde's interview by &#13;
    the JAIC at the so-called "Landvetter meeting" on 31 March 1995, which Enn &#13;
    Neidre, in spite of strong objections by the Swedes and Finns, had insisted &#13;
    on attending by pointing to his membership in the Estonian part of JAIC. He &#13;
    actually attended in a blue captain's uniform, which he had never done before &#13;
    and never did thereafter. </font></p>&#13;

    <i>"I came down to the car deck in the middle, went aft at first, turned the &#13;
    key, walked forward towards the ramp, a couple of meters away from the bow &#13;
    ramp heard strong crashing noise, I told the bridge by walkie-talkie about &#13;
    the noise and got the order to remain and check what it is all about. I stayed &#13;
    there for 5 minutes and controlled in the vicinity, what I could see. After &#13;
    that I opened the doors in front of the panel and all lights were green. I &#13;
    asked for permission from the bridge to go on with my round, which was granted." &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According &#13;
      to normal procedure this should have been around 00.45-00.50 hours, i.e. &#13;
      at the time when Kadak was in the ECR and saw water penetrating the bow &#13;
      ramp. The communication between Silver Linde/bridge via walkie-talkie should &#13;
      have been overheard by the watch engineer Treu, who has not stated anything &#13;
      in this respect in any of his 12 known statements and interviews. What he &#13;
      stated, however, in all but two of these twelve statements/interviews is &#13;
      that he heard Silver Linde report to the bridge that there was<b> water &#13;
      on car deck</b>. Safety officer Ervin Roden also overheard the walkie-talkie &#13;
      communication between Silver Linde and the bridge. Ervin Roden had been &#13;
      sleeping in his cabin with the walkie-talkie on when he suddenly heard Silver &#13;
      Linde shouting to the bridge that there was<b> quite a lot of water on the &#13;
      car deck</b> and that they had to abandon the vessel. (See the memos made &#13;

      there had to be one red lamp, because at sea the harbour securing of the &#13;
      visor is open, thus the indicator light is red. This would have been the &#13;
      proper reply by Silver Linde, but he had been instructed differently by &#13;
      the security adviser of Estline, Captain Enn Neidre, who obviously was not &#13;
      aware of this respectively not acquainted with the installation. After this &#13;
      'Group of Experts' had explained in writing to the JAIC the different functions &#13;
      and meanings of the indicator lights, the consultant of the Estonian part &#13;
      of the JAIC, Professor Jaan Metsaveer, tried to correct the already existing &#13;
      impression that the Estonians did not know how their relevant safety installations &#13;
      functioned, by stating at a joint meeting of the JAIC and this 'Group of &#13;
      Experts' that the explanation for "all lights were green" was the fact that &#13;
      the careful boatswain always closed the harbour securing at sea<b> to avoid &#13;
      any lights being red</b>. After presentation of the video print below, from &#13;
      one of the underwater videos showing the harbour securing open, the professor &#13;
      remained silent for the rest of the meeting.</font></p>&#13;

</ul><blockquote>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the &#13;
    above analysis the following conclusions have to be drawn:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) There had certainly &#13;
    been bangs/crashes on the car deck at about 00.45 hours, but definitely not &#13;
    just one. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) Silver Linde &#13;
    must have noted a lot of water on the car deck at about this time or earlier &#13;
    and certainly reported this to the bridge. It is possible that he looked into &#13;
    the control panel and thereby also looked at the control lights which were &#13;
    certainly not all green because definitely the bow ramp was not properly locked &#13;
    and the harbour securing was open. The control panel must have been open because &#13;
    the boatswain was working on the hydraulic cylinders of the visor and bow &#13;
    ramp. In this connection his remark made on 3 December 1994 has to be understood, &#13;
    that the <b>controls for the bow ramp could only be operated by a special &#13;
    key which was in the possession of the boatswain.</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) If Silver Linde &#13;
    really went back to the bridge it must have been at 01.00 hours or just before &#13;
    because the big heel occurred at 01.02 hours according to the clock of Mikael &#13;
    Öun, and less than 5 minutes later Per-Erik Ehrnsten already saw him coming &#13;
    out of the port inner alleyway on deck 7 walking into the forward central &#13;
    stairway (details later on). It is possible that Linde went down to the Information &#13;
    desk just after 01.00 hours - helped the elderly couple on deck 7, which took &#13;
    about a minute according to his own statement, continued to deck 5 and was &#13;
    at the Information desk when the big heel occurred, whereafter he pushed up &#13;
    to the crew accommodation on deck 7. According to Per-Erik Ehrnsten Linde &#13;
    was talking into his walkie-talkie all the time even when he fell and the &#13;
    other two crew members who were with him - presumably Aulis Lee and Aldo Metspalu &#13;
    - helped him back on to his feet and later out on to the deck. It is doubtful &#13;
    and also unimportant whether he ever went down to deck 4 since it is highly &#13;
    doubtful that he ever got an order from the bridge to go down to the car deck, &#13;
    because since 00.45 hours or earlier it was known to those on watch that there &#13;
    was water on the car deck and it is most probable that 2nd mate Peter Kannuussaar &#13;
    and the nautical advisor Juri Aavik were already on the car deck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) This could be &#13;
    the confirmation for a remark made by Linde which he made only once, viz. &#13;
    that <b>he was sent down to the Information desk to advise them to alarm the &#13;
    passengers.</b> It is also amazing that he admitted to having looked at his &#13;
    watch<b> at 01.24 hours when he was already in the liferaft and the vessel &#13;
    was on the side </b>bearing in mind that <b>the first "Mayday" was only picked-up &#13;
    at 01.22 hours </b>and the<b> 3rd mate Andres Tammes was telling SILJA EUROPA &#13;
    at 01.25 that the list was 20°/30° to the right side.</b> Even if Silver Linde's &#13;
    watch had been wrong by 2-3 minutes the discrepancy is remarkable, i.e. just &#13;
    when the mates had finally decided to transmit the "Mayday" at least A.B. &#13;
    sailor Linde was already in the liferaft. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) This means also &#13;
    that some of the AB's had left the vessel already at a stage when more or &#13;
    less all the passengers and other crew members were still on board, because &#13;
    at 01.24 hours the heel was probably between 50°-60°. Also Einar Kukk - who &#13;
    was rather early outside on deck 7 - has testified that Silver Linde was already &#13;
    in the liferaft when he went forward. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Margus Treu is one &#13;
    of the three survivors considered by the JAIC to be the key witnesses and, &#13;
    thus, was questioned in detail, however, in the presence of the head of the &#13;
    nautical department of ESCO and safety adviser of ESTLINE, Captain Enn Neidre, &#13;
    who was then still a member of the Estonian part of the JAIC and as such insisted &#13;
    on participating despite the urgent requests of the Swedish and Finnish members &#13;
    to stay home. When the psychological expert of the JAIC, the Swede Bengt Schager, &#13;
    was interviewed by Jutta Rabe of Spiegel TV in this connection, he replied &#13;
    the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Q:<i> Hannes &#13;
      Kadak has withdrawn that he saw water coming in at 00.46 hrs, which he withdrew &#13;
      later. He first made a very precise statement and later withdrew it. </i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: <i>Oh, yes, &#13;
      you mean that statement, yes. Ah, it was revealed during the Landvetter &#13;
      investigation, when I was asking him and I don't have any explanation to &#13;
      what he said, but I was very curious, because first he said that he had &#13;
      thought about it and wasn't sure anymore and 1 minute later he wasn't sure &#13;
      at all whether he had said so at all. So, I don't know what to believe of &#13;
      that. I am in the hands of the witness, sometimes.</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Q:<i> But can &#13;
      it be that confusion was caused, that there were people on behalf of the &#13;
      Shipping Company who were employed there, who were also attending that meeting &#13;
      and Mr. Neidre was more or less like a boss for him, and people do get insecure &#13;
      when being asked. </i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: (nodding) <i>Yes, &#13;
      and <b>Mr. Neidre was in full uniform as well for the first time that I &#13;
      have seen it. </b></i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Q: <i><b>But was &#13;
      that very smart?</b></i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A:<b><i> I don't &#13;
      think so, but we had no option, this was the way the Estonians wanted it. &#13;
      Although I had some feelings about it, he was a member of the Commission, &#13;
      I could not say to him, please, I want to talk with him alone. This may &#13;
      have altered some of the responses in the interview, yes.« </i></b></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that Captain &#13;
    Enn Neidre, working ashore in the ESCO administration for many years, <b>had &#13;
    without doubt deliberately put on his captain's uniform to intimidate the &#13;
    crew witnesses and, looking at the answers they have given, he did it successfully. &#13;
    </b> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence, &#13;
    Treu said less than he had said in his initial statements and stuck to his &#13;
    impossible wrong timing, on which, however, the JAIC has built up their equally &#13;
    impossible casualty scenario. Margus Treu, who is indeed the key witness, &#13;
    because he apparently saw on the monitor how the bow ramp was struck and broke &#13;
    open, because this is what he told motorman Hannes Kadak in explanation of &#13;
    the water ingress on to the car deck according to the first statement of Kadak &#13;
    made on 29 September 1994 to the Finnish criminal police in Turku when he &#13;
    said:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»- suddenly &#13;
      the vessel heeled to starboard, he ran back to the ECR where Treu was watching &#13;
      the monitor and said:<b> "The situation is serious" or "bad" "because the &#13;
      ramp has been struck and became broken." - </b>saw on the monitor that there &#13;
      were high waves on the car deck and that the water level had already reached &#13;
      the height of the personal cars.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was not mentioned &#13;
    by any of the JAIC members at the Landvetter meeting, although it concerns &#13;
    one of the topics of the casualty sequence-of-events. The JAIC members instead &#13;
    spent their time with intimidating Kadak to the effect that he withdrew his &#13;
    initial and very precise statement <i>"that at 00.46 hours he saw water penetrating &#13;
    the bow ramp at the upper starboard corner".</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In detail:<br/><b>(1) on 28.09.94 at 10.03 hours by the Central Criminal Police, Turku:</b></font></p>&#13;

      bangs and when the camera turned to the bow, saw very much water entering &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- they tried to &#13;
      pump out the water that was entering the ship. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    above short statement implies two circumstances: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) when Treu felt &#13;
    the heavy bangs/blows, the monitor either did not show the bow ramp (because &#13;
    the system was still switched to the rotating mode) or he was somewhere else &#13;
    in the ECR, thus he states: <i>"When the camera turned to the bow, I saw very &#13;
    much water entering from that direction." </i>There might well have been some &#13;
    time between him feeling the impacts and seeing the water penetrate at the &#13;
    bow ramp which does not exclude that at the time of the impacts water was &#13;
    already penetrating the bow ramp. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Treu states &#13;
    that there was only water on the car deck, not in the engine room, but goes &#13;
    on to say that they tried to pump out the water that was entering the ship. &#13;
    Since it is not possible to pump water from the car deck, water must have &#13;
    been in some compartments in the vessel which were pumpable, i.e. 1st deck &#13;
    and/or 0-deck. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    statement was most probably made before anyone from ESCO or the JAIC had spoken &#13;
    to him and can thus be considered uninfluenced. It is the only of the official &#13;
    statements in which he testifies to have felt the two double, hard bangs at &#13;
    about 01.00 hours. At 01.15 hours he certainly saw water entering the car &#13;
    deck via the ramp, but he does not say whether he looked at the monitor straight &#13;
    after the bangs. Actually water had already penetrated the ramp before 01.00 &#13;
    hours. If he saw it for the first time, his timing must be wrong by 13-15 &#13;
    minutes, unless he did not look at the monitor before because he was busy &#13;
    with other matters, e.g. the starboard stabiliser. This is also confirmed &#13;
    by his statement that the list at 01.30 hours was 45°, which it actually was &#13;
    already at ca. 01.15 hours, whilst at 01.30 hours the vessel was on the side &#13;
    or was almost on the side, as confirmed by many survivors, e.g. trainee mate &#13;
    Einar Kukk who looked at his watch. </font></p>&#13;

    that at the ramp itself and its sides there were no sealings. This means that &#13;
    the ramp was there and visible, but at the sides and underneath water was &#13;
    pressing through as if there were no sealings. This implies that the ramp &#13;
    was open to some extent and it remained open since then, because when Treu &#13;
    looked at the monitor after the bangs, water was already penetrating the ramp &#13;

    even after 01.05 hours, as he has said in previous statements and which, again, &#13;
    proves his error in timing (whereby he was probably following instructions).</font></li>&#13;

      was about 580-600 rpm's. The stabilisers were deployed at 00.30. Treu did &#13;
      not notice the ship turning before or during the heeling over. He saw Silver &#13;
      Linde on the ECR monitor at about 01.00. Treu heard on the walkie-talkie &#13;

      side of the heeled ship from which the wind and the waves came, i.e. the &#13;

      time 24.00-04.00. Speed after 2400 was about 14.7-15 knots. Shortly after &#13;
      the accident the speed was reduced. Port ME before the accident was running &#13;
      at 560 rmp's. After the accident it was running at 500 rpm's and the speed &#13;
      was 10-11 knots. Treu did not note any vibrations, indicating that the vessel &#13;
      was turning after the accident. According to the ETA-Pilot the normal speed &#13;
      of the vessel was 580-600 rpm's. <b>Linde was seen on the monitor at 01.00, &#13;
      coming from the pumping station for the visor and ramp</b>. The bridge ordered &#13;
      us to pump ballast when the ship had heeled. When the ME's and Aux's stopped &#13;
      the bridge asked if we could pump out freshwater. 01.20 or 01.21 "Mr. Skylight". &#13;
      01.20-01.25 ME's stopped due to heel. First Port, then Stb'd ME's stopped &#13;
      due to low oil pressure. Treu left the ECR at 01.30-01.32 when the Aux's &#13;
      had stopped. On (=when looking at) the monitor the ramp seemed to be in &#13;
      its correct position when water entered the car deck around the (ramp) edges. &#13;
      The 4th Engineer had the watch 20.00-24.00 on the Estonian coast. He may &#13;
      have information on the vessel's speed. The ship started heeling when water &#13;
      entered the car deck. When Treu left the ECR the list was 70°-75°. Treu &#13;
      did not observe any heel of the vessel first to one and then to the other &#13;
      side, for instance first to Stb'd and then P and finally back to Stb'd. &#13;
      The ship was thus according to Treu heeling to Stb'd at all times. The 3rd &#13;
      Engineer always had the 00.00-04.00 watch. The propeller pitch could be &#13;
      seen from the ECR. Treu did not observe any change in pitch. When the ship's &#13;
      stern sank the vessel came towards Treu. Treu was in the water on the Stb'd &#13;
      side by the funnel. When he got into a lifeboat the ship's stern was already &#13;
      deep down. The ship was upright (same Finnish word for upright = stern down &#13;
      / stern up, as for upright = no heel, Peter's note). The lights went out &#13;
      at 01.30. The emergency generator functioned at greater angles of heel than &#13;
      the Aux's. The lube oil level in the engines was higher than normal. The &#13;
      emergency generator stopped when the heel was great, almost 90°. When the &#13;
      emergency generator stopped the accumulator batteries took over. There was &#13;
      light until the vessel sank. Treu did not see Linde except on the monitor, &#13;
      but overheard his report to the bridge. Treu is positive that Linde reported &#13;
      to the bridge. Treu cannot estimate when the vessel sank, maybe at 01.45-02.00. &#13;
      Linde reported water on the car deck at 01.15. He did not say how much or &#13;
      how the water was entering the car deck. Treu kept the camera fixed on the &#13;
      bow ramp. There were no observations of water on the lower passenger deck. &#13;
      When the camera showed the bow ramp the same picture was also displayed &#13;
      on the bridge monitor on the Stb'd side of the chart room. Water entered &#13;
      the car deck along the sides of the ramp under great pressure. Water flew &#13;
      all the way on to the video camera lens. Treu did not observe water leaking &#13;
      along the upper edge of the ramp. Partly the upper part of the ramp was &#13;
      visible on the monitor. Treu was not able to say whether he could have observed &#13;
      water entering along the upper edge. The stabilising fins were deployed &#13;
      at 00.30.«</i></font></p>&#13;

      was some truck that had started to move. I went to the monitor and looked &#13;
      at different pictures and then it showed the forward part. There I saw that &#13;
      water was penetrating between ramp and hull at such high pressure that the &#13;
      camera was hit. I realised that the vessel rolled 3° to starboard and 1.5° &#13;
      to port and the next time much more to starboard and upright and then a &#13;
      very heavy heel to starboard.<b> Then I heard Silver Linde's voice on the &#13;

      <b>01.20-01.25</b> the bridge asked whether it was possible to pump over &#13;
      ballast, which it was not. The port main engines had shut off already. Tried &#13;
      to restart them, but in vain. This was at about the time of the first "Mr. &#13;
      Skylight" and 1 minute later the lifeboat alarm was given. <br/>&#13;
      Thereafter I ordered Kadak and Sillaste to leave the engine room. This was &#13;
      at <b>01.30</b> when also the auxiliaries stopped.<br/>&#13;
      Next the bridge asked whether it would be possible to pump freshwater overboard &#13;
      which it was not because there was no more power for the pumps.<br/>&#13;
      I informed the bridge that I was also going up now to check the emergency &#13;
      generator, which stopped after a short while when the vessel was on the &#13;
      side and the batteries took over the supply of the emergency lights. <b>The &#13;
      main engines shut off at a heel angle of more than 45° and less than 70°.<br/>&#13;
      The auxiliaries stopped at a heel of 70° and the emergency generator at &#13;
      90°. <br/>&#13;
      It took maximal 10 minutes from the time the auxiliaries stopped to being &#13;
      in the water.<br/>&#13;
      At 01.35/40 I left the engine room. <br/>&#13;
      Apparently the engine output as well as the pitch had been reduced before &#13;
      the big heel.<br/>&#13;

      were stopped from the bridge.</b><br/>&#13;
      There has always been maintenance work by the crew to the visor, bow ramp &#13;
      and locking devices as well as hydraulic cylinders for which 2nd engineer &#13;
      Peeter Tüür was responsible.<br/><b>Elmar Siegel saw the emergency lifeboat No. 1 - starboard side, the first &#13;

    auto-matically. </i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Olle Noord:</b> &#13;

  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Olle Noord:</b> &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above indicates &#13;
    that Treu, who is probably the only one to know exactly what happened, does &#13;
    not believe that the stabilisers were out, at least not during the final stage &#13;
    when the speed had dropped below 4 knots. It is the only indication in one &#13;
    of the official documents that there might have been something wrong with &#13;
    the stabilisers, because N&amp;T/ ESCO and the crew remain silent on this, which &#13;
    indicates that there might be some connection with the casualty.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the book &#13;
    by Andi Meister, the Chairman of the JAIC until July 1996, it is stated in &#13;
    Chapter 7 on page 134: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»At about 00.35 &#13;
    hours the watch engineer went into the engine room in order to get the stabilisers &#13;
    in operation. At 00.30 hours the watch officer on the bridge activated the &#13;
    stabilisers in accordance with the master's instructions, however, one fin &#13;
    did not follow (did not move out).«</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not stated &#13;
    what was done to rectify the problem, but Margus Treu told the English journalist &#13;
    Phillip Wearne in May 1998 that there had been a "stabiliser alarm" at about &#13;
    00.30 hours, when the bridge tried to activate the stabilisers. It concerned &#13;
    the starboard fin which did not move out and it took him and Sillaste ca. &#13;
    5 minutes to activate this fin.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andi Meister &#13;
    told Phillip Wearne subsequently that Henrik Sillaste did not confirm the &#13;
    above and has refused to talk about it. Sillaste told the journalist, however, &#13;
    that there had been major problems with the starboard stabiliser during the &#13;
    installation when the vessel had been in drydock at Naantali the last time, &#13;
    among other things; there had been a fire. The damage caused had to be repaired &#13;
    during the already very short time available and the vessel sailed as planned, &#13;
    however, without everything in way of the starboard stabiliser installation &#13;
    being carried out in accordance with good workmanship as it should have been.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection &#13;
    two remarks have to be made:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) At the time &#13;
    of the casualty DIANA II was in the process of being taken over by N&amp;T/ESCO &#13;
    in Rostock. Some Estonian crew members were already on board, also Captain &#13;
    Erik Moik as well as the representative of the Turku Repair Yard responsible &#13;
    for the installation of the stabilisers on the ESTONIA. This man had become &#13;
    very stressed upon hearing about the ESTONIA casualty, but then became very &#13;
    relaxed when it was reported that the visor had broken off.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) One of the divers &#13;
    spoke to a member of SEA and indicated that it is known why the casualty really &#13;
    happened, viz. something relevant had been only "spot welded" instead of fully &#13;
    welded and the element could thus not withstand the forces acting on it.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the analysis &#13;
    of the statements of the survivors from deck 1 the possibility that the starboard &#13;
    stabiliser fin broke off and tore open the empty starboard heeling tank and/or &#13;
    the auxiliary engine room compartment will have to be borne in mind, in particular &#13;
    since recent reports from Tallinn state that there had been a lot of water &#13;
    in the engine room which they had been unable to pump out.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary:</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Treu was in the &#13;
    ECR from the beginning of the casualty sequence-of-events up to the end; possibly &#13;
    only interrupted by the time when he was working on the starboard stabiliser. &#13;
    During the time when he was in the ECR he had two clocks in his immediate &#13;
    vicinity in addition to his own wristwatch. Consequently, it has to be assumed &#13;
    that at least his first time statements were relatively exact, whilst the &#13;
    other times, e.g. when the vessel was on her side, were purely guessed. Later &#13;
    he knew from the other survivors that this had been at about 01.30 hours and &#13;
    said it was so when he was interviewed by Jutta Rabe. Therefore in his first &#13;
    statement he stated the time for the two impacts to have been ca. 01.00 hours, &#13;
    which is confirmed by many others, but later moved it back by some 15 minutes, &#13;
    obviously under the influence of his superiors. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He has, however, &#13;
    repeatedly stated that after having felt those two unusual impacts he immediately &#13;
    went to the monitor and saw water streaming in respectively being pressed &#13;
    through at the sides of the bow ramp, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly but not &#13;
    fully open, because if the bow ramp had been pulled open by the visor broken-off &#13;
    he could not have seen the bow ramp and certainly would not have stated that &#13;
    water was streaming in at the sides. This does not exclude that water had &#13;
    been streaming on to the car deck for some time already because he was not &#13;
    looking to the monitor all the time, probably this was the first time.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the &#13;
    following might be concluded:</font> &#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu heard &#13;
        and felt the impacts, which were not caused by waves, at around 01.00 &#13;
        hours;</font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he went straight &#13;
        to the monitor and saw water penetrating the bow ramp at both sides under &#13;
        pressure, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly open because at that time the &#13;
        ramp actuators had already been torn off the ramp and the ramp was being &#13;
        held by the mooring line - see Chapter 19.</font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- simultaneously &#13;
        or shortly thereafter Silver Linde reported the water ingress to the bridge, &#13;
        i.e. he must have been on the car deck further aft - probably in the door &#13;
        of the centre casing - where the camera did not pick him up and where &#13;
        he saw the water ingress directly. This would mean that it was well before &#13;
        01.00 hours, because the abrupt heel occurred at 01.02 hours and how else &#13;
        could Linde be in the crew accommodation on 7th deck at ca. 01.05 hours?</font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu in his &#13;
        statements 2 and 3 has probably deliberately moved the times backwards &#13;
        by some 10 to 15 minutes; this becomes most obvious when he states - in &#13;
        his interview to Jutta Rabe of March 1995 - that the auxiliaries only &#13;
        stopped when the list was about 45° and that then it was 01.30 hours when &#13;
        the vessel was actually on her starboard side and that he, himself, was &#13;
        already on deck. </font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The authors &#13;
        of the book 'Katastrofen Kurs', Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, who &#13;
        had early access to the initially confidential protocols and working papers &#13;
        of the Swedish part of the JAIC, have revealed that also JAIC had formed &#13;
        the opinion that Treu's timing was impossible. The authors explain this &#13;
        with <i>"Treu's loyalty to Estline which apparently increased all the &#13;
        more as time went on" </i>(last paragraph on page 157). </font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The authors continue &#13;

        stopped."<br/>&#13;
        This, however, is not possible, because Andres Tammes had told the SILJA &#13;
        EUROPA in the course of the distress communi-cation already at 01.25 hours &#13;
        that they had a blackout and therefore could not state their position. &#13;
        But there cannot be a 'blackout' as long as the auxiliaries are running. &#13;
        Even the Estonian Commission admitted that "there has to be something &#13;

      loyalty towards Estline is also demonstrated by the obvious fact that in &#13;

      bow ramp was slightly open thus enabling water to penetrate the gaps at &#13;
      both sides from the full visor on to the car deck, viz. just what he told &#13;
      Hannes Kadak after Kadak entered the ECR following the abrupt heeling to &#13;
      starboard: <i>"Tillständet är allvarligt" eller "dälig", "efterson rampen &#13;
      har slagit sönder." </i>This translated means: <i>"The situation is dangerous/serious, &#13;

      thing he did was to switch the camera to the fore part of the car deck where &#13;
      he could see the water coming in, he stayed there waiting for orders and &#13;
      advice from the bridge;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - then the big &#13;
      heel came and<b> he watched the monitor only for a few moments </b>because &#13;
      he had to concentrate on keeping the engines running as long as possible;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he did not report &#13;
      to the bridge what he saw on the monitor, because only a few seconds after &#13;
      seeing it he heard Silver Linde report water on the car deck; </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- at 01.18 the &#13;
      heel was so big that the main engines stopped, first the port and then the &#13;
      starboard side, thereafter he sent Henrik Sillaste and the motorman up and &#13;
      maybe one or two minutes later also the auxiliaries shut off and he also &#13;
      left for the 8th deck;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - apart from the &#13;
      fact that the port ballast tank was full and the starboard one empty it &#13;
      had just been a normal heavy weather voyage;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>the heel &#13;
      was 25°-30° when the port main engines stopped </b>and after half or one &#13;
      minute also the starboard side stopped;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>at that time &#13;
      the monitor had already fallen down,</b> with a big crashing noise, and &#13;
      the only and last thing he had seen on it was the water being pressed through &#13;
      along both sides of the bow ramp which was spraying on to the camera, thereafter &#13;
      <b>he did not look to the monitor anymore;</b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>left the &#13;
      engine room around 01.28/30</b> when it was already dark and the floor had &#13;
      changed to being the wall;</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In spite of his &#13;
    loyalty to Estline and ESCO Margus Treu gave a very important indication by &#13;
    stating that the water being pressed through the sides of the bow ramp reached &#13;
    the lens of the video camera fitted at the upper forepart of the centre casing. &#13;
    As the distance between the bow ramp and the centre casing is 27 m this is &#13;
    technically not possible and the water smashing against the camera lens must &#13;
    have come from somewhere else, the drencher system. It has to be assumed that &#13;
    the drencher system on the car deck as well as the fire alarm were activated &#13;
    and the nozzles fitted under deck also between the bow ramp and the centre &#13;
    casing were spraying water under pressure also on the camera lens. As this &#13;
    did definitely happen before 01.00 hours Margus Treu's timing has to be adjusted &#13;
    accordingly. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, Henrik &#13;
    Sillaste had made various statements to journalists, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The first one &#13;
    was published already on 28.09.94 at 15.57 hours Finnish time: <i>»According &#13;
    to an Estonian machine operator,<b> Henrik Sillaste</b>, who managed to escape &#13;
    from the ship through a funnel, the <b>gate of the car deck was for some reason &#13;
    left slightly open and water came to the deck through it.</b> The body of &#13;
    water, weighing many tons, that got inside the ferry made it very unstable, &#13;
    and the wind and the size of the waves (according to the reports as high as &#13;
    10 metres) were enough to push the ship to its side.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - On 29.09.94 the &#13;
    following was published in a Helsinki newspaper:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Motorman <b>Henrik &#13;
    Sillaste</b> (25), translation:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Soon after &#13;
      midnight "Estonia's" forepart sunk heavily. I watched the car deck via the &#13;
      video control system and saw <b>that water rushed in through the bow door, &#13;
      which earlier has had problems</b>. At this moment the water already stood &#13;
      knee-deep on the car deck. Thereafter "Estonia" rapidly listed over. The &#13;
      2 main engines stopped soon thereafter, but the auxiliary engines were still &#13;
      running.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sillaste has maintained &#13;
    this observation, viz. that the bow ramp was slightly open when he looked &#13;
    at the monitor for the first time in the Engine Control Room (ECR), during &#13;
    all his statements. Although he is expressing himself very carefully and has, &#13;
    after the first three statements taken on 28/29 September 1994 at Turku, obviously &#13;
    been prepared for possible further questioning concerning the visor and its &#13;
    locking devices, however, apparently not in respect of the bow ramp. Also &#13;
    the fact that he was not invited to attend the Landvetter meeting at the end &#13;
    of March 1995 indicates that neither JAIC nor ESCO did consider him to be &#13;
    a key witness. This apparently changed after this 'Group of Experts' had presented &#13;
    his detailed evidence, including the drawing he had made showing the slightly &#13;
    open bow ramp with water pressing through at both sides, to JAIC in the course &#13;
    of the joint meetings held during the second half of 1995.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already in January &#13;
    1996 he was again interrogated by the Estonian security police when he made &#13;
    another drawing showing the same condition of the slightly open bow ramp with &#13;

    between the 4th/6th deck the electricity went off and 2-3 seconds later the &#13;
    emergency generator started to work and they continued to deck 8, had problems &#13;
    opening the door at the port side because the heel was already some 70° and &#13;
    it was above their heads, managed finally to open the door by pressing their &#13;
    backs against it;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the emergency &#13;
    exit was well constructed by the yard, it was quite narrow, thus they could &#13;
    lean with their backs against the left wall and climb all the way up, if it &#13;
    had been wider, they would have just fallen down;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw 2nd/3rd mates &#13;
    leaving the bridge after the Tyfon signal - did not see them again;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- ran (after &#13;
    the heel) through the auxiliary engine room, the storage room, main engine &#13;
    room and in these 4 rooms there was no water.</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of Henrik &#13;
    Sillaste's various statements the following has to be concluded:<br/>&#13;
    Due to his observations and respective statements Henrik Sillaste is one of &#13;
    the key witnesses of the case. His statement: <i><b>"that the bow ramp was &#13;
    only slightly open at a time when the vessel had already heeled abruptly to &#13;
    starboard"</b></i> is crucial for the cause consideration, because obviously &#13;
    the big heel had not been caused<i> "by large quantities of water flooding &#13;
    onto car deck through the bow ramp having been pulled open by the forward &#13;
    tumbling visor" </i>as alleged by the JAIC.<br/>&#13;
    Also his timing was quite good in the first statements but was changed possibly &#13;
    as consequence of influence of his principals, as evidenced by his statement &#13;
    taken by the Estonian security police on 04.10.1994. <br/><b>As a matter of fact, it was Henrik Sillaste who told a member of this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' in March 1995 that all the crew survivors had been threatened &#13;
    to be immediately sacked by ESCO if they said anything against ESCO's interests &#13;
    to Commission members, journalists or other interested parties and this had &#13;
    scared all the of the crew survivors considerably.<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, &#13;
    in addition to the aforementioned statements about the slightly open bow ramp &#13;
    he has made a number of interesting remarks: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- The lifeboat &#13;
    lashings had been released in advance, which means that the vessel's command &#13;
    had been aware for some time before the big heel at 01.02 hours that the ferry &#13;
    was in danger of sinking. </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The heavy impacts &#13;
    - three in total, of which not everyone had felt the first one, but which &#13;
    he had, having been so close - were not caused by waves</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When he came to &#13;
    the ECR two of the four main engines had already stopped, i.e. at ca. 01.03/04 &#13;
    hours, and the other two followed shortly afterwards, the watertight doors &#13;
    were closed and the bilge pumps were running. (Since bilge pumps can only &#13;
    pump from sections below the car deck, i.e. 1st deck or 0-deck, they must &#13;
    have pumped from one or both of these decks.)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He could not phone &#13;
    the chief engineer since the telephone had fallen down which - according to &#13;
    Treu - also the monitor showing the bow ramp had done at some stage.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He and Kadak left &#13;
    the ECR upstairs already after having been there for only 5 minutes. Then &#13;
    all four main engines had stopped already, but the diesel generators were &#13;
    still running, possibly for another 1 or 2 minutes. This means that the main &#13;
    engines had stopped already at about 01.10 hours or earlier and the diesel &#13;
    generators stopped at about 01.12 hours, whereafter the emergency generator &#13;
    in the funnel had started automatically, which among other things was also &#13;
    supplying power to the bilge pumps. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Just before the &#13;
    diesel generators stopped he heard the<i> "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2"</i> &#13;
    alarm, which consequently must have been at about 01.10/01.11 hours. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The testimony of &#13;
    Henrik Sillaste further proves that the visor was full of water and remained &#13;
    full, respectively refilled time and again,<b> because water continued to &#13;
    stream on to the car deck no matter whether the bow was diving into waves &#13;
    or not.<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent &#13;
    fact that there was something wrong with the vacuum system at about 00.30 &#13;
    hours is confirmed by the statement of Anneli Konrad, one of the dancing girls, &#13;
    who has testified, inter alia:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>"At about 00.30 &#13;
      hours my performance was over and I was on my way to my cabin. I went wrong &#13;
      and ended up on the 2nd car deck where I heard a crash. I found my cabin &#13;
      finally feeling very sick. There was no water in the toilet."</i></font></p>&#13;

      first watch ever in the engine room of ESTONIA at 00.00 hours, made an inspection &#13;
      round of the engine room and returned to the ECR, whereafter Margus Treu &#13;
      made his round;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - sometime later &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- at 00.46 &#13;
      hours he saw a jet of water penetrating the right side of the bow ramp,</b> &#13;
      and thought it was rain water, did not report it to anybody; </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when Margus Treu &#13;
      returned to the ECR Kadak went to the workshop next to the ECR and on same &#13;
      deck, and did some work;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - suddenly the &#13;
      vessel sank down and fell to starboard, he ran back to the ECR, where Treu &#13;
      was watching the monitor and said:</font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>"The situation &#13;
        is serious" or "bad" "because the ramp has been struck and became broken.";</b></font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw on the monitor &#13;
      that there were high waves on the car deck and the water level had already &#13;
      reached the height of the personal cars;</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - thereafter the &#13;
      light began to blink which meant "boat alarm";</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - then <b>Henrik &#13;
      Sillaste came in </b>and the <b>watertight doors closed again;</b></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    means that the watertight doors were already closed when Henrik Sillaste arrived &#13;
    1-2 minutes after the sharp heel to starboard. Since a sharp heel to starboard &#13;
    is no reason to close the watertight door in the engine room, there must have &#13;
    been something else and earlier which caused Margus Treu to close the watertight &#13;
    doors, apparently without instructions from the bridge, because he has testified &#13;
    that he had only had two communications with the bridge subsequently in relation &#13;
    to pumping water to the high port side. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Main subject of the &#13;
    questioning of Hannes Kadak was his statement - obviously uninfluenced - made &#13;

    162 ff. of the book "<i>Katastrofen Kurs</i>" by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, &#13;
    who had early access to the confidential protocol of the meeting, the Questions/Answers &#13;
    quoted below developed: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»JAIC: Are these &#13;
      statements correct?</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have &#13;
      thought a lot about it in hindsight, but I cannot say if it was exactly &#13;
      that way.</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: You say &#13;
      here that you saw water before midnight (Swedish time)?</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have &#13;
      thought it over and it can be totally wrong.</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: We may &#13;
      consequently consider it to be uncertain?</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: Uncertain. &#13;
      </font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: Uncertain. &#13;
      This can mean that it might have been so or it might not have been so. In &#13;
      the statement it is written down that ".. at 23.46 hours I saw on the monitor &#13;
      that water penetrated at the right side of the ramp". Is it correct that &#13;
      you said so to the officer in charge of the interrogation? </font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: It is &#13;
      so that, after coming home, I have thought it over and it is so that I am &#13;
      not so sure about it, and I have considered whether it could be wrong and &#13;
      why could I say so. </font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: But you &#13;
      did say so to the interpreter during the questioning on the 29th?</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: After &#13;
      I came ashore I have testified so many times.«</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At this stage &#13;
      Enn Neidre, member of the Estonian part of JAIC and in a captain's full &#13;
      dress uniform, interrupted the discussion:</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Neidre: I &#13;
      made notes at the hearing on 29 September and in these notes nowhere can &#13;
      the time 23.46 hours be found.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It &#13;
    is clear that Neidre never wrote down 23.46 hours as Kadak never said 23.46, &#13;
    because he was talking in Estonian time and in his respective statement 00.46 &#13;
    hours is stated as the time when he saw the water penetrating.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The psychological &#13;
    expert to the JAIC, Bengt Schager, commented on the Kadak testimony as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»... that Kadak &#13;
      probably saw a water stream, but that he is afraid that this information &#13;
      can be relevant. We have no evidence that he has more information than he &#13;
      has told us and today he might be unwilling to give more information, because &#13;
      he might correctly assume that in such a case he would be partly blamed &#13;
      for the catastrophe ...., the water stream could hardly have been there, &#13;
      rather small or thin, because then it would hardly be visible on a small &#13;
      monitor.« </i> </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The further statement &#13;
    of Hannes Kadak, viz. that Margus Treu had told him:<b><i> "The situation &#13;
    is dangerous or bad, because the ramp was struck and became broken."</i></b> &#13;
    is much more important, but was apparently not questioned by the JAIC.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary &#13;
    it has to be concluded that the JAIC changed the initial statement of Kadak, &#13;
    that he saw - expressed carefully and already under intimidation - <b>a jet &#13;
    of water penetrating the bow ramp,</b> into a "trickle" of water. Of course, &#13;
    a "trickle" would certainly have been difficult to observe on the small monitor, &#13;
    so what Kadak must have seen was much more, viz. almost the same picture that &#13;
    all three of them saw subsequently and of which Sillaste made two drawings. &#13;
    The reason why Kadak did not react differently was most likely because he &#13;
    was on his first watch ever on ESTONIA and simply did not know any better.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the statements &#13;
    made by Treu and Sillaste in 1996 and subsequently - as is now known - that &#13;
    all three - Treu, Kadak and Sillaste - had left the engine control room much &#13;
    earlier, i.e. Kadak and Sillaste when the heel was 30°-35° and Treu when the &#13;
    heel was 40°-45°. It also explains how 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür saw Kadak &#13;
    on the open deck 7 as he left his cabin on the forward port side of deck 7 &#13;
    through the window. Since Sillaste and Kadak were together with Silver Linde &#13;
    in the same liferaft, which they all boarded in the forward part below the &#13;
    bridge and Linde has testified that he was in the liferaft already a<b>t 01.23 &#13;
    hours</b>, it has to be assumed that they were out on the open deck 7 at a &#13;
    rather early stage, earlier than many crew members from cabins on decks 7 &#13;
    and 8, not to speak of the passengers from the lower decks! </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This and the following pages &#13;
    were left empty for possible new evidence and are thus used for additional &#13;
    testimony received from survivors during the November 1999 hearings and which &#13;
    shall be quoted as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Carl-Erik Reintamm - cabin &#13;
    1094 - 1st deck: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- He couldn't sleep well &#13;
    and suddenly he heard a sound like the vessel was proceeding through ice, &#13;
    it was "a scraping noise", after he had realised that it couldn't be ice during &#13;
    that time of the year, he finally thought that the vessel ran over something, &#13;
    ca. half a minute later the vessel heeled to starboard.<br/>&#13;
    - he ran out into the alleyway, but he didn't look at his watch, in the alleyway &#13;
    he saw water in the angle between the wall and the floor streaming along the &#13;
    wall with considerable speed, <br/>&#13;
    - it was a considerable quantity of water, about 40 centimetres high, which &#13;
    was not running down the stairs from the above car deck, but was rushing very &#13;
    quickly through the centre alleyway in the angle between wall and floor, which &#13;
    made him run even faster into the stairway and up; <br/>&#13;
    - he did not note any water coming through the car deck doors but heard an &#13;
    alarm signal which sounded like an old fashioned alarm clock which was ringing &#13;
    all the time without interruption, <br/>&#13;
    - when he came up to Deck 7 he saw two officers from the crew wearing white &#13;
    shirts with epaulettes, but he doesn't recall the number of stripes, at least &#13;
    one of them had a walkie-talkie in his hand, <br/>&#13;
    - he informed them that the vessel was taking water into deck 1, where upon &#13;
    one officer instructed the other one to go down and check the situation when &#13;
    quite suddenly the ship heeled over again; and the two officers fell to the &#13;
    deck, where after both got back on their feet and went down, probably to investigate; &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - he went out on deck through the left door on Deck 7 (that was the door on &#13;
    the part which was down) and saw two ferries far away from the "Estonia"; &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - the lamps went off and on and the vessel heeled more and more,<br/>&#13;
    - probably when he tried o release a life boat, he saw a huge thing floating &#13;
    along the vessel, but he cannot exactly say when he saw it, the thing looked &#13;
    square and at first he thought that is was a part of the vessel the waves &#13;
    were washing over it and it was then on one level with the sea surface, he &#13;
    says it was so "quite some time" and others should have also seen it,<br/>&#13;
    - in the official protocol he was wrongly quoted since it was stated there &#13;
    that he had seen "many items", but he underlines that it was only one item, &#13;
    several metres long each side, like a steel plate it was white and/or light &#13;
    and it was big and still very close and that moment he thought that this item &#13;
    was "the reason for everything", <br/>&#13;
    - it floated away with small waves coming over it and then it disappeared.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Pierre Thiger - Admiral's &#13;
    Pub - 5th deck, starboard aft :</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - when he was on the port &#13;
    side of the hull and looked forward, he saw something looking like a stabiliser &#13;
    fin, it was a least 5 metres long and standing completely in the air, but &#13;
    it could not have been a stabiliser fin which was much further aft, the object &#13;
    moved transverse and it was 50 % higher than wide <br/>&#13;
    - he was sitting above the stabiliser fin, but the thing he saw was far forward &#13;
    of the vessel<br/>&#13;
    - he was subsequently washed into the water by a wave, and when he finally &#13;
    had time to look from in the water, he saw that the visor was no more there. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    Note: The "thing" Pierre Thiger saw far forward must have been the port aft &#13;
    part of the visor bulwark sticking up and extending the port hull side of &#13;
    the ferry. See page 1091.</font></p>&#13;

      as a matter of fact Pierre Thiger has never before or thereafter experienced &#13;
      that a vessel was smashed so hard into heavy headseas, each time the bow &#13;
      smashed into the sea, the vessel almost stopped, was shaking and vibrating &#13;
      and then accelerated again until it smashed into the next wave and so on, &#13;
      in addition to this very hard pitching, she was rolling, always more to &#13;
      starboard than to port, because he remembers having to continuously hold &#13;
      himself to the bar with one hand (for the last hour or so he was sitting &#13;

      between, metal to metal and thought it was a collision, the ship was shaking &#13;
      and vibrating differently than before, shortly afterwards he noted that &#13;
      she was pitching more, but made much slower and deeper movements, there &#13;
      were no more bangs but suddenly he felt vibrations in the aft ship which &#13;
      made him think that they had turned the stern into the sea and the pitch &#13;
      was on astern, he could not see anything out of the window, he felt the &#13;
      vibrations from the propeller (glasses were clinking) and then he heard &#13;
      the strange noise: A very low noise and simultaneously the pitch movements &#13;
      stopped as if a wave had struck under the stern, then all vibrations stopped &#13;
      and in the same second she continued to pitch again, however, without any &#13;
      engine noise, for about one minute she was only pitching, then pitching &#13;
      and rolling, and then only rolling - she made two full swings - more to &#13;
      starboard, less to port, and the third time she heeled over deep to starboard, &#13;
      did not right up again and then fell abruptly to about 40°/45°, this was &#13;
      just before midnight (Swedish time), she came back to almost upright position &#13;
      and then heeled to about 10°/15° and further heeled to about 40°/45° when &#13;
      she stabilised herself for at least 10 probably 12 minutes, whereafter she &#13;
      continued to heel from 45° to 90° relatively quickly before she was fully &#13;
      on the side, the funnel smashed a couple of times on the waves;<br/>&#13;
      when he had reached the outside of the 7th deck, the list was about 40°, &#13;
      wind and sea were coming abeam from starboard and at port side, 5-6 points &#13;
      aft of abeam there were lights, after they had been on deck for sometime &#13;
      already and the<b> list had slowly increased to about 45°, the lights went &#13;
      out, but immediately thereafter came back, all this was within the ca. 10-12 &#13;

    side aft.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He had to give &#13;
    a speech and simultaneously show 7-8 overheads. At some time, when he was &#13;
    still showing overheads, a high whining noise started which apparently came &#13;
    somewhere from below. It was loud but constant at the beginning and he just &#13;
    had to speak in a louder voice.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He thinks that &#13;
    they had another break after his presentation when the conference hostess &#13;
    was asked to have the machine or pump, creating the disturbing noises, turned &#13;
    off, however, she came back stating that nothing could be done about it.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The noise changed &#13;
    to on/off, which was even more disturbing and we closed down the conference &#13;
    about 15-20 minutes earlier than planned, i.e. at 20.40/20.45 hours ST. This &#13;
    means that the noise did presumably start at about 20.30 hours ST.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner at restaurant &#13;
    "SEASIDE" on deck 6, starboard side, was ordered for 21.00 hours ST, but they &#13;
    had to wait some 5-10 minutes before their tables were ready.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner took probably &#13;
    11/2 hours and the time was then about 22.30/22.40 hours ST. He still heard &#13;
    the "noise" in the distance. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having walked &#13;
    around for some time he met four ladies of his group and they went up to deck &#13;
    7, port side where the door to the outside was slamming open/closed and the &#13;
    carpet was soaking wet up to the stairs.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thereafter they &#13;
    decided to visit the Admiral's Pub which they entered probably 23.40/23.45 &#13;
    hours ST. Also here he heard the "noise".</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Shortly afterwards &#13;
    Sörman felt the change in the vessel's movements because she was now pitching &#13;
    softly and started to roll more. It was much more comfortable then the very &#13;
    hard pitching before and he hoped it would remain like this for the rest of &#13;
    the night.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a while near &#13;
    the stage he walked to a sofa in the starboard forward corner. It was then &#13;
    that he felt 2-3 shocks in his feet. These were like blows in the forward/aft &#13;
    direction, somehow like pitching, but different.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The girls sat on &#13;
    the sofa and he sat on a chair and they continued their discussion when Anita &#13;
    suddenly rose saying she would go to her cabin now. They tried in vain to &#13;
    persuade her to stay and Sörman looked at his watch. It was 23.55 hours ST.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They continued &#13;
    to discuss a particular course when suddenly the vessel heeled very slowly, &#13;
    but much deeper to starboard. She heeled so far over that they could see water &#13;
    splashing against the windows next to them. Behind the bar all the glasses &#13;
    hanging underneath the ceiling fell on top of the bar lady.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel came &#13;
    back to more or less upright condition, maybe even a bit to port, but subsequently &#13;
    heeled again and even deeper to starboard. This time all the tables, chairs &#13;
    and whatever else was not solidly fixed rushed to the starboard side.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The saw again water &#13;
    on the window but the vessel came back again to almost upright condition and &#13;
    they took the chance and rushed to the exit which they managed.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was then that &#13;
    he realised that there were no more engine noises, but the lights were on. &#13;
    </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel heeled &#13;
    again to starboard, now stepwise with stable periods in between. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They rushed up &#13;
    to deck 6 and further to deck 7 where they reached the aft door and managed &#13;
    to get out to the open deck with difficulties.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They could still &#13;
    walk on the deck, the heel was then probably 30°. </font></li>&#13;

    third of this deck there were passenger cabins, the luxury cabins equipped &#13;
    with mobile phones. In the larger part, there were the A-la-carte Restaurants &#13;
    SeaSide and Poseidon, the Baltic Bar and the Casino. Also this area had been &#13;
    changed considerably in comparison to the newbuilding layout. The above drawing &#13;
    shows the latest condition. Before referring to the testimony of passengers &#13;
    and crew members having been on this deck, the summary of the statement of &#13;
    Mats Hillerström shall be outlined. He was actually sharing cabin 1026 below &#13;
    car deck with 3 others but felt unwell and scared and thus moved up to the &#13;
    aft and open part of deck 6 already after midnight, ship's time, ca. 00.30 &#13;
    hours! See also Chapter 20. </font></p>&#13;

    <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»He &#13;
      stayed in a sheltered place on starboard side best protected against the &#13;
      storm and heard nothing but the noises of the storm. The air was full of &#13;
      spray. At some time he saw a large vessel on starboard side apparently on &#13;
      same course and speed. Also on starboard side, but far away and astern, &#13;
      there was another vessel which was slower because the distance appeared &#13;
      to increase. He looked at his watch and it was 01.05 hours. Suddenly and &#13;
      without any previous indication the vessel heeled to starboard. He saw the &#13;
      tables and chairs inside the restaurant moving to starboard. Within a very &#13;
      short time the vessel took such a list that he could not walk anymore on &#13;
      the deck, but had to pull himself along the railing on the aft part to the &#13;
      higher port side.</i></font></p>&#13;

    the performance of the dance group from Pörnu was ended due to violent movements &#13;
    of the vessel. This was about 00.00 hours Estonian time. The vessel was pitching &#13;

    another heavy bang, the foreship rose again and the third bang - metal to &#13;
    metal - was heard and felt, followed by the heel to starboard.</font></li>&#13;

    the vessel would be taken ashore." In his first statement taken by the Finnish &#13;

    thick,<br/>&#13;
    - it had the same colour as the bottom,<br/>&#13;
    - it was not a bilge keel, <br/>&#13;
    - he does not believe that it was a damaged propeller blade of the bow thruster &#13;
    because those do not have the colour of the bottom, <br/>&#13;
    - when he was underneath the bridge, he heard a muffled sound from there and &#13;
    compares it with an imploding TV-set, <br/>&#13;
    - when he was down in the sea he saw that the visor was missing,<br/>&#13;

    at about 19.15/20 hours. At 19.00 hours vehicles were still boarding, he could &#13;
    hear the sounds.<br/>&#13;
    - Vessel started pitching noticeably after 21.00 hours and at about 23.00 &#13;
    hours he went to his cabin 6304 on deck 6 which was an inside cabin without &#13;
    windows, the bed was athwartships. <br/>&#13;
    - He cannot recall significant rolling, just pitching, <br/>&#13;
    - he woke up several times by vibrations in the hull when the bow was diving &#13;
    into the waves, <br/>&#13;
    - at a certain time these vibrations were replaced by new sounds which were &#13;
    regular 4-5 tong, tong sounds, a short pause and the same again, which appeared &#13;
    to be transmitted through the ship's structure as vibrations from somewhere &#13;
    forward and below; the tong, tong sounds came in such short intervals that &#13;
    they could not have been caused by wave movements; there was no change in &#13;
    the ship's movements that he could associate wit the tong, tong sounds.<br/>&#13;
    - There were 4-5 "tongs", then a pause of 4-5 seconds and then again 4-5 "tongs", &#13;
    the interval between the "tongs" remained the same, ice floes crashing against &#13;
    the hull in the winter cause less heavy sounds than these tongs did;<br/>&#13;
    - he does not recall having noted change of engine revolutions at that time; &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - there were 2 "tong" sequences before the big heel to starboard occurred. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - There was first one smaller and then a bigger heel to starboard when he &#13;
    just had his trousers on and everything flew against the door; - he removed &#13;
    these things from the door, went out, turned into the central (forward) stairway, &#13;
    rushed up the stairs to deck 7, where he was helped out on deck by Silver &#13;
    Linde and two other sailors, Silver Linde was talking into his walkie-talkie &#13;
    and refused to follow some order, he was very irritated (P.E. Ehrnsten understands &#13;
    Estonian): <br/>&#13;
    - The heel was about 30° when he came out on deck and the wind and waves came &#13;
    in from the aft port quarter (30° to 60° from aft of abeam, port side). <br/>&#13;
    - With his back to the wall (longitudinal bulkhead on deck7) he could see &#13;
    the two ferries 20-30° aft of abeam at port side; at the same time he could &#13;
    see the moon and the bow simultaneously; <br/>&#13;
    - the ferry stabilised at a heel of 30-50° for quite a while; <br/>&#13;
    - the waves came from port aft and the ship was drifting with the wind, he &#13;
    and other people were eventually washed overboard by waves approaching from &#13;
    aft and washing oblique about the bottom, ended up in the water on the same &#13;
    side as funnel and bridge were, i.e. in the lee. <br/>&#13;
    - He saw the stabiliser fin sticking out about below the forward door, it &#13;
    was not moving. <br/>&#13;
    - When he was washed overboard he was slightly forward of the bridge.<br/>&#13;
    - From the water he could see the unbroken silhouette of the vessel against &#13;
    the moonlight.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The store area was &#13;
    accessible by 3 large lifts and 1 stairway. The first store lift had a door &#13;
    to starboard, while the second one had doors to both sides. Both store lifts &#13;
    had no sills at all and led down to the 1st deck in way of the engine room. &#13;
    At the aft end of the centre casing a container lift of 10' x 8' x 8' was &#13;
    installed which led down to the 1st deck only. The doors opened to the aft &#13;
    and also had no sill. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The sliding doors &#13;
    on car deck level leading from car deck into the centre casing above the 1st &#13;
    deck had sills of 130 mm above the 100 mm sill running around the entire centre &#13;
    casing just interrupted in way of the 2 store lifts, i.e. the sills of the &#13;
    sliding doors had a total height of 230 mm. None of the lift doors were watertight. &#13;
    All 4 lifts went up to the 8th deck.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the 1st deck &#13;
    was located below the bulkhead deck the compartments were separated by watertight &#13;
    bulkheads which, in way of the passenger accommodations, were only interrupted &#13;
    by the longitudinal alleyway. The openings could be closed by watertight doors &#13;
    operated hydraulically either from a panel on the bridge or manually on site. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The doors were sliding &#13;
    doors, closing from port to starboard. The hydraulic station for these doors &#13;
    was located about midships in the centre casing on 2nd car deck (B-deck) level. &#13;
    Before and during the closing of the doors yellow flashlights went on.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The passenger accommodation &#13;
    was divided into 6 watertight compartments of which the first compartment &#13;
    was located directly behind the empty ballast water tank No. 2 and above the &#13;
    three freshwater tanks 4A, 4B, 5 which were all said to be full with in total &#13;
    291 ts.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 2nd and 3rd &#13;
    compartments were directly above the sauna/ swimming pool area, the 4th compartment &#13;
    was at starboard side above the sewage plant belong to the engine room and &#13;
    at port side above 2 conference rooms. The 5th and 6th compartments were located &#13;
    above the heeling tanks, two centre heavy fuel tanks and the stabiliser fin &#13;
    spaces. The void spaces in between were connected to the engine room area.</font></p>&#13;

    12.4.2.151</a>. The most relevant parts of this statement in connection with &#13;
    the casualty scenario shall be quoted as follows:</font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - at about 22.30 &#13;
    hours (Swedish time) down to the cabin and to bed;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he woke up &#13;
    suddenly from the strong noise of rushing water which he could hear from both &#13;
    sides, but loudest from starboard side; these noises alarmed him;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- in addition &#13;
    he heard quite strong metallic banging noises which definitely had not been &#13;
    there before; he sat up in bed and put his feet on the floor, since the bed &#13;
    was athwartships he was facing the door looking aft;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he lit a &#13;
    cigarette and listened intently to the strange and frightening noise scenario;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- after a little &#13;
    while he suddenly heard the starting up noise of an hydraulic pump or pumps &#13;
    followed by the clicking of valves and then the typical noise created by an &#13;
    hydraulic system under load;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- simultaneously &#13;
    he heard the banging of sledge hammers;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the noises &#13;
    came probably from forward;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the hydraulic &#13;
    under load noise faded away and came back again whilst the sledge-hammer banging &#13;
    noise more or less continued. Both the hydraulic noise and the sledge-hammer &#13;
    banging noise continued for ca. 10-15 minutes whilst the other banging noises, &#13;
    then heard already for some 20-25 minutes, also continued; <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the hydraulic &#13;
    noise and the sledge-hammer noise stopped with a short, sharp metallic crash &#13;
    which gave him the impression that something heavy, metallic had broken; <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- after a 'silence' &#13;
    of 30-40 seconds the next really extreme crash followed in connection with &#13;
    an abrupt stopping of the ferry which was so 'sudden' that he was thrown against &#13;
    the front wall of his bed;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">it was a short, &#13;
    sharp intense crash as if the ship had struck against something;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he jumped &#13;
    out of his bed and put his clothes on very quickly when he realised that all &#13;
    the engine noises had stopped and that the ferry was now making much softer &#13;
    pitch movements;this must have been at about 01.00 hours.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he rushed &#13;
    out of his cabin, turned right towards the stairway, around the aft part of &#13;
    it, through the open WT-door (watertight) towards aft, but turned around after &#13;
    some meters and headed forward, by now the vessel had started making sideway &#13;
    movements (rolling), the door at the port side of the stairway was either &#13;
    open or missing, and he rushed through it; <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he turned &#13;
    right up the stairs when his coat got caught at the beginning of the right &#13;
    handrail, he turned round to his right and looked over his right shoulder &#13;
    out through the door opening into the alleyway;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he saw 2 &#13;
    goosenecks next to the cabin wall, as indicated on the drawing on the pages &#13;
    517/518;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- out of these &#13;
    goosenecks water was streaming under great pressure, he also saw water penetrating &#13;
    the door forward of these goosenecks in the 3rd compartment which belonged &#13;
    to a cleaning room; <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he saw the &#13;
    water running over the floors;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he had freed &#13;
    his jacket and he rushed up the stairs;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when he was &#13;
    about half way up to the car deck the vessel heeled suddenly and abruptly &#13;
    more than 45°, probably 50° or 60°;</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: &#13;
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason &#13;
    for Övberg estimating this large angle of heel is the fact that he was standing &#13;
    on the wall, as shown by the drawing below to his statement and on the following &#13;
    paragraph. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the ferry quickly &#13;
    came back to almost upright position but then heeled about 10° to 15° to starboard &#13;
    and thereafter slowly heeled in steps further to starboard, which each rolling &#13;
    movement a little bit more. Övberg continued upwards, i.e. when the ferry &#13;
    rolled backed to almost upright condition, he rushed upwards as far and as &#13;
    fast as he could and when the ferry subsequently heeled wide to starboard, &#13;
    he stood waiting and holding fast to the rails of the stairs, etc., his way &#13;
    up is demonstrated by a further drawing above;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he reached the &#13;
    7th deck and managed to get out through the open door whereafter he saw at &#13;
    once the lights of one ferry at port side;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    means that the vessel was then already on a south-easterly heading. - there &#13;
    was one light shining from the port bridge wing, otherwise the bridge was &#13;
    dark. Note: This is a key statement which gives a great deal of explanation &#13;
    because Carl Övberg could be questioned in detail and because he was very &#13;
    co-operative. There can be no doubt that many of the survivors could give &#13;
    considerably more details if they would have been asked properly by the JAIC. &#13;
    Another unforgivable mistake of the JAIC who had the authority and the means &#13;
    of carrying out a detailed interrogation of all the survivors, however, did &#13;
    not make use of it.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Martin had told &#13;
    the police that his cabin no. was 1027, however, according to the drawing &#13;
    he made showing his way up, it was cabin no. 1028. The drawing is attached &#13;
    to his statement, which can be summarized as follows: - He went to bed at &#13;
    23.00-23.30 hours, noticed heavy movements of the vessel and lots of cracking &#13;
    noises. He also heard that something was frequently heavily beating against &#13;
    the vessel;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - About 10-15 minutes &#13;
    before the accident became a fact, i.e. before the big heel, he woke up from &#13;
    the heavy movements of the vessel, heard a scraping noise, i.e. it was cracking &#13;
    and scraping very close to him on the deck above him. This was (for him) the &#13;
    introduction to the developments which ended in the catastrophe;<br/>&#13;
    - <b>A little later Martin felt that the noises were connected to the shaking &#13;
    of the vessel, and then the vessel began to heel noticeably. He and his bed &#13;
    moved upwards while the others in their beds on the opposite side of the cabin &#13;
    moved downwards. He is unable to explain this in more detail. Simultaneously &#13;
    the strong scraping noise was being continuously heard and then Jan Gustavsson &#13;
    said: <i>"Now we have run aground." </i>So clear and distinct was this noise; &#13;
    </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since &#13;
    noises associated with "running aground" cannot originate from above but must &#13;
    have come from below, this was probably a wrong description or memory of Martin &#13;
    Nilsson. Below him were the starboard heeling tank and the pocket of the starboard &#13;
    stabiliser.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He left the cabin &#13;
    and jumped up one flight of stairs to the next deck (car deck), where he noted &#13;
    several centimetres of water on the floor;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- When he had &#13;
    reached the boat deck he observed two crew members talking into walkie-talkies;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- A search &#13;
    light was shining from vessel's side into the water; the lights went out/on &#13;
    several times;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He saw the &#13;

      from the 1st deck survived. This is a comparatively high number, bearing &#13;
      in mind that from all the six accommodation decks only 137 persons (official &#13;
      number) had survived, because the survivors from deck 1 had by far the longest &#13;
      and most difficult way to deck 7. Presum-ably because they had been warned &#13;
      early through their proximity to the noise scenario, they had therefore &#13;
      left their cabins earlier and faster than many of those from the upper decks &#13;
      had done.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) 9 reported &#13;
      water on the 1st deck, of which two noted the water already <b>before </b>the &#13;
      big heel, but the others only one minute or more thereafter. 4 reported &#13;
      a lot of water up to 0.4 m high which was rushing very quickly respectively &#13;
      under pressure. Thus water has been on the 1st and consequently also on &#13;
      0-deck <b>before </b>the big heel. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) 9 reported &#13;
      water on car deck level inside the centre casing and/or penetrating the &#13;
      car deck, of which one saw water directly on the car deck through a partly &#13;
      open car deck door (most aft stairway for passengers). </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(d) 14 reported &#13;
      the abrupt wide heel (45°-60°), were thrown out of their beds and/or against &#13;
      the walls etc., but only three reported that the ferry more or less righted &#13;
      up thereafter, although it is absolutely clear that if the ferry had not &#13;
      righted from a heel of 45°-60°, nobody would have been able to escape from &#13;
      the 1st deck or would have been able to reach the outside of deck 7 from &#13;
      any other deck. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) Water was reported &#13;
      from the 1st, the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th compartments. In cabin 1120 located &#13;
      in the first compartment in the centre line, on top of a full freshwater &#13;
      tank the water penetrated the door from the alleyway, i.e. the water height &#13;
      in the alleyway exceeded the height of the door sill. In the 3rd compartment &#13;
      water was noted in the alleyway, probably originating from either the spiral &#13;
      stairway or the lift casing. In the 4th compartment water was seen to escape &#13;
      from 2 ventilation openings under high pressure. In the 5th compartment &#13;
      water was reported to have penetrated the floor. All observations were made &#13;
      either in the longitudinal alleyway in the centre line or in athwartships &#13;
      alleyways at the starboard side only. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) The time for &#13;
      the big heel was stated only by few survivors to have been just after 01.00 &#13;

      scenario:<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most &#13;
      of the survivors reported <b>at least one very heavy bang, crash, impact &#13;
      combined with an abrupt stopping of the vessel as if the vessel had collided &#13;
      with something,</b> which was so strong that they were thrown against the &#13;
      walls, etc. Before this very dramatic crash/impact noise, which apparently &#13;
      caused the vessel to stop abruptly and which was clearly before the sharp &#13;
      and wide heels to starboard, there had been other noise scenarios heard &#13;
      by survivors, which were different. While Carl Övberg was in his cabin in &#13;
      the 4th compartment he heard hydraulic and sledge-hammer type banging noises. &#13;
      The others further forward and aft heard howling, squeaking and, most dominantly, &#13;
      scraping noises which were combined with the shaking of the vessel and which &#13;
      sounded as if the vessel proceeded through ice.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (n) This noise &#13;
      scenario has been explained in detail to the diving and underwater explosives &#13;
      expert Brian Braidwood, who has excluded, with a high degree of certainty, &#13;
      that any of the noises heard by the survivors could have been caused by &#13;
      explosions. See also Chapter 32. </font></p>&#13;

    The operator was surprised that the ship had not called for help earlier if &#13;
    they had problems. The ship had obviously had both engine and electrical problems. &#13;
    It remains a mystery why the crew on the bridge delayed the alarm, didn't &#13;
    they realise how serious the situation was? In the aftermath this is just &#13;

    only from 01.40-01.48 hours, when ESTONIA's stern was probably just settling &#13;
    down on the sea bottom and her bow rose out of the water, thus ESTONIA could &#13;

    find out what the Finnish Navy records had on file, a meeting was held with &#13;
    Commander Vesa Ennevaara at the head office of the Finnish Navy in December &#13;
    1998 and the results of the discussions are summarised as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The 1994 radar &#13;
      system was based on the equipment from the 1980s. The software was not as &#13;
      comprehensive as the current one. The main difference was that the 1994 &#13;
      system did not record data in permanent memory, which the new system will &#13;
      do when fully implemented. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tracking &#13;
      units, such as radar stations, aeroplanes and ships etc pick up targets &#13;
      and report all new objects to the next level op's centre. The acquisition &#13;
      of targets involves all military arms (navy, air force and army) as well &#13;
      as pilots, coast guard and customs. New targets are assigned a number ID &#13;
      and as soon as identification is possible, either by VHF or visually, the &#13;
      name of the object is determined. The new system will operate the identification &#13;
      process also by radar transponder codes, combined with the old system.<br/>&#13;
      Tracking was done by one radar station at a time - feeding data to the OP's &#13;
      centre - until the target was formally "handed over" to the next tracking &#13;
      station. At the same time an object could be visible and followed on the &#13;
      screens of other tracking stations, as well, but they would not feed data &#13;
      into the system.<br/>&#13;
      Tracking details were stored and transmitted in bursts from radar stations &#13;
      to the OP's centres. The data was stored in buffer memories. Overflow of &#13;
      data in a buffer memory would automatically cause deletion of the oldest &#13;
      data. Depending on the amount of data on each separate object this could &#13;
      mean anything from hours to maybe a full day or more of data remained in &#13;
      each buffer. The buffer for Estonia (if the ship was within range and was &#13;
      tracked at all, which according to Ennevaara is unclear) probably would &#13;
      have contained data all the way from Tallinn/Nayssaar, but no one thought &#13;
      to ask for it imme-diately after the accident. All old data was lost due &#13;
      to the lack of memory storage space and unavailability of such a software &#13;
      facility in 1994, because when the and rescue operation commenced much older &#13;

      he could see, the Estonia was never in front of SILJA EUROPA - but came &#13;
      up from the south-east. This track would be different from the Navy radar &#13;
      track designated Estonia - and would be similar to the one put forward by &#13;
      the JAIC. Seppelin said that the Estonia normally came up straight from &#13;
      the south-east, i.e. from what must have been the Estonia/Nayssaar sound &#13;
      and crossed the track of the SILJA EUROPA. One crew of the Estonia would &#13;
      arrogantly cross the SILJA EUROPA track close under the bow and force the &#13;
      Officer to pull back on the engines, while the other crew would always pass &#13;
      politely under the stern. This was in the summer when the SILJA EUROPA entered &#13;
      at Sandhamn and the Estonia at Söderarm.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- &#13;
      he does not believe that the Navy track is that of the Estonia. Neither &#13;
      does the officer (Capt. Ltn. Niemelä from Utö), who was in charge of the &#13;
      radar station, primarily because the Navy track follows the normal routing &#13;
      system, initially west then, west-south-west. <br/>&#13;
      - he does not recall radio interruptions but remembers that the MARIELLA's &#13;
      inability to reach Helsinki Radio on VHF Ch 16 and MF 2182 was widely discussed &#13;

    hours, while the Finnish Government, first of all the Prime Minister, was &#13;
    informed only at 04.55 hours and the other Government members thereafter until &#13;
    about 05.40 hours. At that time the chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, &#13;
    Kari Lethola, was already on his way to Turku. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other &#13;
    hand, MRCC Helsinki did inform MRCC Tallinn at 02.55 hours, but <i>"not in &#13;
    detail, only that something had happened and that people were in distress",</i> &#13;
    whilst subsequently - at 10.05 hours - the Finnish Minister of the Interior &#13;
    Pekkavinen told the press that <i>"the Estonian Authorities were informed &#13;
    at 02.00 hours by the Finnish Authorities".<br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently &#13;
    there were "other authorities" also involved in the casualty which had nothing &#13;
    to do with the rescue services and which must have been informed already that &#13;
    ESTONIA was in trouble while the vessel was still afloat.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It also has &#13;
    to be assumed with certainty that there had been intense communication between &#13;
    the ESTONIA and Tallinn, at least during the last hour, and that ESCO knew &#13;
    what was going on onboard the ESTONIA much before the first, weak 'Mayday' &#13;
    was received by MARIELLA. Officially 137 persons survived the catastrophe, &#13;
    93 bodies were brought ashore and identified, and 759 persons are officially &#13;
    missing. These figures do not include the Iraqis in the trailer on the car &#13;
    deck, the unregistered Pakistanis and the also unregistered relatives of crew &#13;
    members also said to have been on board. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>25.4 <br/>&#13;
    Further Evidence </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">According to the JAIC Report, &#13;
    Chapter 8.2, the first ROV inspection from the wreck was carried out from &#13;
    the "HALLI" on 2 October 1994. The respective logbook pages have recently &#13;
    been received, although the name "HALLI" is nowhere written on the available &#13;
    pages. According to the logbook entries Tuomo Karppinen and Siimo Aarnio, &#13;
    member and expert of the Finnish JAIC were onboard besides Turunen, Louhivuori &#13;
    and Tenhunen who are unknown. Video recordings by ROV were performed between &#13;
    12.17 hours - 20.45 hours. The three tapes received from the Finnish JAIC &#13;
    in March 1995 do fall into this time frame, however, substantial parts were &#13;
    cut out in a rather unprofessional way. <br/>&#13;
    Note: During a recent telephone conversation between Tuomo Karppinen and the &#13;
    Swedish journalist Knut Carlqvist <br/>&#13;
    Karppinen revealed that they had made certain cuts already onboard of "HALLI". &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    Further according to the logbook the first anchor position 59°22,91'N; 21°40,93'E &#13;
    was very close to the wreck, where video recordings took place between 12.17 &#13;
    hours and about 16.30 hours. At 16.40 hours the vessel shifted position to &#13;
    59°22,54'N; 21°40,51'E where the anchor was dropped at 17.00 hours and video &#13;
    recording started again at 17.15 hours and stopped at 20.45 hours. This second &#13;
    position was about half way between the Mayday position 59°22,0'N; 21°40'E &#13;
    and the wreck position. This second "HALLI" position was in direction 207°, &#13;
    0.45 nm distant from the wreck. <br/>&#13;
    This means that the video footage provided should show after 17.00 hours only &#13;
    pictures from the seabed because the longest ROV umbilical is 400 m long while &#13;
    the wreck is 0.45 nm = 830 m away. It would also make no sense to lift anchor &#13;
    from a position next to the wreck and move almost 1/2 mile away and then send &#13;
    the ROV back all the way. <br/>&#13;
    Since, however, all three videos submitted by the Finnish JAIC to be raw material &#13;
    show numerous sequences with parts of the wreck well after 17.00 hours it &#13;
    has to be concluded that these videos were not only manipulated by or on behalf &#13;
    of the Finnish JAIC by cutting out vital parts of evidence, but also by changing &#13;
    the times. The reason for this time manipulation is obvious: It was the intention &#13;
    to create the impression that the many interesting objects on the bottom of &#13;
    the sea were lying relatively close to the wreck because the ROV moves away &#13;
    from the stern and views the objects only 2 or 3 minutes later. Actually the &#13;
    ROV did start from a position 0.45 nm = 830 m to the SSW of the wreck and &#13;
    then proceeded another 250-300 mm to the W or SW, i.e. 1100-1200 m to the &#13;
    SSW of the wreck these objects were found, e.g. the ramp rail, the stabiliser &#13;
    fin, parts from the car deck and other objects which the public was prevented &#13;
    from seeing by tape cuts. <br/>&#13;
    This leads to the following conclusions:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) The vessel drifted from &#13;
    SSW to NNE. <br/>&#13;
    (b) The vessel was very severely heeled or already upside down in a position &#13;
    about 1000 m to the SSW of the wreck.<br/>&#13;
    (c) Since the ROV found objects were about on the connection line between &#13;
    Mayday position and wreck position, slightly closer to the Mayday position, &#13;
    and the engines had stopped about 10 minutes before the Mayday already, it &#13;
    has to be assumed that the vessel was initially even further to the South, &#13;
    probably 0.5 nm to the SW of the Mayday position at about 01.10/12 hours. &#13;
    According to the 3rd engineer the final speed was 6 kn, i.e. going further &#13;
    back 10 minutes at 6 kn to 01.02 hours when the big heel occurred and the &#13;
    vessel was reportedly turning to port, that is to say 1 nm, the vessel was &#13;
    at 01.02 hours at the approximate position 59°21,6'N; 21°37,8'N, which is &#13;
    not unrealistic. From this position the alleged visor position lies about &#13;
    30°, 1.2-1.3 nm distant and it is more than doubtful that ESTONIA had ever &#13;
    been up that far in the North.<br/>&#13;
    (d) It has to be concluded that the plot of ESTONIA's track in the JAIC Report &#13;
    on page 173 is completely wrong. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Also from the vessel "TURSAS", &#13;
    used for the ROV inspections on 9/10 October 1994, the logbook page for 9 &#13;
    October was recently made available and has meanwhile been translated. It &#13;
    reveals that according to the logbook entry on 9 October at 10.20 hours three &#13;
    JAIC representatives: Saarikko, Tenhunen and Louhivuori boarded the vessel &#13;
    and ROV equipment was also taken onboard. Tenhunen and Louhivouri had already &#13;
    taken part in the ROV inspection on 2 October. <br/>&#13;
    At 17.30 hours anchor was dropped in position 59°22,93'N; 21°40,73'E which &#13;
    was near the stern of the wreck. At 21.10 hours the anchor was lifted and &#13;
    dropped again 200 m to the NE at 21.25 hours, i.e. to port of the bow of the &#13;
    wreck. Video recording is not mentioned in the log, but the available video &#13;
    covers the time between 21.55 and 02.15 hours on the following day, 10 October &#13;
    1994. The video recordings made during the 1st anchoring between 17.30-21.10 &#13;
    hours are not available except for a short sequence of 18 seconds found between &#13;
    two cuts at 22.21 and 22.22 hours. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> The logbook from the search &#13;
    vessel "TURSAS" from 16, 17, 18 October 1994 are available and have been translated. &#13;
    Accordingly the vessel was in Latokori on 16th and 17th October, where at &#13;
    09.20 hours the following persons boarded the vessel: Saarikko, Louhivuori, &#13;
    Turunen, Nuorteva, Ratia and Kujansuu. Louhivuori and Turunen were already &#13;
    participating in the previous ROV inspections and Nuorteva is a sonar expert &#13;
    from the Finnish Navy, according to the newspaper reports - see Chapter 37.2 &#13;
    - and he is also mentioned in the fax reports from Kari Lethola to Olof Forssberg &#13;
    - see Chapter 24. The "TURSAS" left her berth and shortly afterwards moored &#13;
    alongside the CG vessel "UISKO". From this vessel the Swedish Captain Commander &#13;
    Tönnström came onboard and the Finnish Captain Lieutenant Mikkilä left the &#13;
    vessel, which subsequently sailed. At 21.30 hours in position 59°25,45'N; &#13;
    21°43,55'E the search by means of sidescan sonar was commenced. This position &#13;
    lies 3 nm to the NE of the wreck where in all probability ESTONIA can never &#13;
    have been, thus it has to be assumed that the gentlemen were searching for &#13;
    something different than the visor of the ESTONIA. The search was subsequently &#13;
    carried from ca. 1 nm to the East of the wreck, to ca. 2 nm to the South and &#13;
    1 nm to the West of the wreck, which according to Kari Lethola's fax to Olof &#13;
    Forssberg on 06.10.94 - see page 702 - had already been searched before. Anyway, &#13;
    according to the "TURSAS" log entries the visor was found and identified by &#13;
    ROV on 18.10.94 at 15.30 hours in position x = 6585650, y = 1587250 which, &#13;
    according to the F.B.N. computer corresponds to 59°22,526'N; 21°39,322'E which &#13;
    was subsequently repeated by the Finnish Navy to be 59°22,97'N; 21°39,33'E. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">According to the logbook &#13;
    entry (manual) of icebreaker "NORDICA" the visor was found in position 59°23'N; &#13;
    21°39,4'E, lifted and brought to Hankö. See Enclosure 24.408.1. There is presently &#13;
    no more evidence on the visor search and position available. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition images &#13;
    2 and 4 show an area of burnt deck paint to starboard of the outer lug plate, &#13;
    i.e. below the location of the bushing in normal condition. This indicates &#13;
    that flame cutting had been carried out that close to the deck that the paint &#13;
    became burnt.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Images 5 and &#13;
    6 show the middle and outer part of the hinge bolt (3). The bolt moved out &#13;
    of the hinges due to the list of the wreck and is ever since standing on the &#13;
    adjacent railbar. There are three areas of green paint visible which are indicated &#13;
    by red dots. Since only the deck was painted green it has to be assumed that &#13;
    the green paint visible on the bolt was deck paint. The hinge arrangement &#13;
    was a closed system without gaps between bushings and lug plates. This was &#13;
    evidently no more the case when the green deck paint was able to reach the &#13;
    bolt at least in three places! The explanation that this was possible can &#13;
    also be found in Subchapter 12.5 and on the enlarged images attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures &#13;
    12.5.181</a>/<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.1.htm" target="_blank">12.5.181.1</a>, &#13;
    i.e. the starboard visor hinge arrangement was totally misaligned with the &#13;
    outer bushing sticking out too much which created the gaps between hinge plates/bushings &#13;
    enabling the green paint to reach the bolt. The condition of the outer part &#13;
    of the outer bushings of which the lower part was evidently cut off explains &#13;
    the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The bolt had &#13;
      only to some extent engaged the outer visor hinge plate.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The burnt &#13;
      off lower part of the bushing made it possible for the bushing to fall off &#13;
      the bolt (contrary to the port where the bushing was intact and consequently &#13;
      remained attached to the bolt - see the following item P 1).</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) During the &#13;
      flame cutting (burning) of the lower part of the said bushing the deck paint &#13;
      below the bushing was burnt because of the narrow distance between the lower &#13;
      part of the bushing and the green deck.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Image 4 shows also &#13;
    scoring marks on the deck in front of the hinge plates evidently caused by &#13;
    the visor arm lower closing plate during opening/closing of the visor. This &#13;
    indicates that the visor was too low in the hinges, a consequence of the burnt &#13;
    out hinge plates. - See Chapter 30.</font></p>&#13;

    to what it should be if the bold would have engaged an intact pocket and the &#13;

    to explain this unusual and unexpected damage in this location, but was stopped &#13;

    bolt is fully extended." <br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The only &#13;
    possibility of such damage being caused in such a location was by closing &#13;
    the ramp by force when the bolt was already extended. Therefore, it has been &#13;
    assumed that the bolt had been extended when the ramp was closed some time &#13;
    before the casualty and the top plate and the adjacent longitudinal plate &#13;
    were pushed in, as visible. Never since this occurrence was it possible to &#13;
    close and lock the ramp properly.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image &#13;
    from the same video also shows changed rope positions and a box attached to &#13;
    the longitudinal part of the recess of the front bulkhead directly above the &#13;
    opening with the ramp actuator fastening (when the ramp was in closed condition). &#13;
    This box is visible on the videos made on 02.10.99 only as a shadow but apparently &#13;
    it was there already. The reason for this difficulty is the much smaller gap &#13;
    between bulkhead and bow ramp at that time. The box will be explained further &#13;
    in Chapter 32.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Not only did the &#13;
    gap increase between 02. and 09.10.94, but also more Teco lines (floatable &#13;
    mooring lines) were rising up between ramp and bulkhead. One of them appears &#13;
    to be turned around the box which must have been manmade. This is surprising &#13;
    because at that time "officially" no divers had been down to the wreck. <br/>&#13;
    The next available images are made from the<b> ROV and diver videos of 01. &#13;
    to 04.12.94</b> and show the same area, however, again with remarkable changes.</font></p>&#13;

    Close ups made from the diver videos of the one hawser left proved it to be &#13;
    jammed in between the extended landing for the actuator fastenings and the &#13;
    bulkhead - see the image below. To the left is the ramp landing and to the &#13;
    right the bulkhead. It is obvious that such jamming can only occur when the &#13;
    ramp was moved open/closed which must have been the case between<b> 09.10.94 &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before &#13;
    in Chapter 27 it has to be assumed that the crew fitted the angle iron in &#13;
    place to support the closing operation, i.e. to ensure smooth closing of the &#13;
    port side of the ramp which was detached from the vessel due to the broken &#13;
    hinges and which was considerably pressed down during opening and closing &#13;
    of the ramp. </font></p>&#13;

    actuator</b> area looks totally different compared to the port one because &#13;
    there is very heavy damage, the probable cause of which shall be explained &#13;
    in Chapter 32. Among other things also the fastening of the starboard actuator &#13;
    to the bow ramp was affected. All available images from this part of the ramp &#13;
    are made from the ROV video of 09.10.94, thus show the ramp pressed against &#13;
    the starboard longitudinal bulkhead part of the recess. For orientation purposes &#13;
    the first image below shows the transverse girder at the bottom in the middle &#13;
    which runs up diagonally to the left where a large crack is visible. The strong &#13;
    girder running from left middle to right up is the starboard outside longitudinal &#13;
    girder. At the port side of the mentioned transverse the landing for the fastenings &#13;
    of the port actuator were fitted, at its starboard side the fastenings for &#13;
    the starboard actuator were fitted.</font></p>&#13;

    the visor was there, thus the pressure escaped to both sides, which cracked &#13;
    open. On the starboard side there was just water, but on the port (inside) &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the pictures/images/drawings &#13;
    shown and explained on the previous pages 847-855 demonstrate the following &#13;
    condition of the bow ramp hinges:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Each hinge consisted &#13;
    of two lugs - one inner, one outer lug - connected to the ramp, one lug connected &#13;
    to the vessel, one hinge bolt and one bearing/bushing. The bolt was secured &#13;
    by one plate at each side which were bolted to the bushing. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Evidently the bolt &#13;
    of the port outer hinge had moved inside the bearing/bushing and had broken &#13;
    the securing plates which were missing at both sides. The reader is reminded &#13;
    that already the last Finnish crew had demanded the renewal of this hinge. &#13;
    See also Subchapter 3.4 and 6.5.1.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently &#13;
    due to the misaligned ramp the bolt worked itself to starboard until the outer &#13;
    lug shipped off the bolt, which apparently caused the inner lug to fail. See &#13;
    right the drawing below (PS outside).</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg856.JPG" width="361" height="166"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The additional load &#13;
    caused also the port inner hinge - see the left drawing (PS inside) above &#13;
    - to fail after some time leaving the bow ramp detached from the vessel at &#13;
    the entire port side.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The detachment &#13;
    of the complete port side of the ramp from the vessel resulted in </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) an increasing &#13;
      misalignment of the whole ramp, and<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) an increasing &#13;
      gap between the ramp and the ramp opening of the car deck.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Furthermore the &#13;
    bow ramp in its function as part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
    above bulkhead deck was no more weathertight, i.e. the car deck was open to &#13;
    the sea as the visor was always quickly water-filled at sea.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The gap between &#13;
    bow ramp and car deck ramp opening at the port lower corner extended from &#13;
    the corner to the centre line and upwards to about B-deck level.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In way of this &#13;
    gap mattresses, plastic sheets, plastic covered bedding, blankets and rags &#13;
    were found, obviously serving as "sealing material".</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - As a result of &#13;
    the port ramp side being detached from the vessel there was also a vertical &#13;
    misalignment between the port ramp side and the adjacent plating of the car &#13;
    deck opening, i.e. the mating lug for the ramp hook and the mating pockets &#13;
    for the securing bolts extending from the adjacent plating were about 100 &#13;
    mm higher up now and could no more be reached by the hook respectively by &#13;
    the bolts already for some time before the casualty, i.e. the port side of &#13;
    the bow ramp could not be secured at all for some time before the casualty. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It follows that &#13;
    the entire port side of the bow ramp was not locked/secured upon departure &#13;
    from Tallinn on 27.09.94.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The starboard &#13;
    inner hinge was still intact, but the ramp lugs were subsequently elongated, &#13;
    i.e. worn, and they would have been the next ones to fail. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Also the strong &#13;
    outer starboard hinge showed signs of wear and elongation and hence had lost &#13;
    its initial load-carrying capacity.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - This means that &#13;
    at the time of the casualty the bow ramp was merely connected to the vessel &#13;
    by the weaker inner and the stronger outer starboard hinges, both of which, &#13;
    however, were substantially worn and hence their load-carrying capacity was &#13;
    reduced correspondingly.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Damage to &#13;
    the construction</b> - (See drawing page 869) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The inside of &#13;
    the bow ramp</b> is only briefly visible when the diver climbs up the starboard &#13;
    side to the flaps at car deck level, pulls himself up along these flaps to &#13;
    the port side hinges and further to the lower securing bolt with mating pocket. &#13;
    On the ramp plating there are two areas with burnt and/or damaged paint, i.e.: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There is an area &#13;
    of ca. 1 m² located between the upper flaps and the level of the car deck &#13;
    opening where the paint is burnt and the plating is severely distorted. The &#13;
    area is inside the ramp house when the ramp is closed.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower area &#13;
    is located in the 3rd row of steel profiles, looking from starboard, which &#13;
    are welded to the ramp plating and the 6th or 7th profile from car deck level &#13;
    as indicated on the picture below by the dark spot. The paint of the plating &#13;
    as well as the two flaps below looks reddish/brown. The plating otherwise &#13;
    does not look affected, but the two flaps are bent and distorted and the car &#13;
    deck plating in way appears to be affected.</font></p>&#13;

    on both sides. - See Subchapter 27.6 and further below in this chapter.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The flaps on the &#13;
    lower side of the ramp normally covering the gap between car deck and ramp &#13;

    green, upright and intact;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Nos. 6/7 &#13;
    was bent towards the car deck and looked brownish/red;<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Nos. 8/9 &#13;
    looked new and green, were upright and undamaged except for a bent edge of &#13;
    the No. 8.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Through the gap &#13;
    between the last flap and the car deck, something big and red, probably bedding &#13;
    in plastic, is visible which is sticking in a big hole in the longitudinal &#13;
    car deck bulkhead. See the following image and drawing:</font></p>&#13;

    raised edge along the starboard side of the ramp </b>(tire-protection bar) &#13;

    ramp anywhere, but buckled and smashed at its forward part as well as the &#13;
    complete forward part of the ramp including the bell crank for the flaps. &#13;
    It was noted when the diver moved down (up) along the port side of the ramp &#13;
    from the port lower pocket of the securing bolt to the upper side that the &#13;
    upper part of the raised edge (tire-protection bar) with lug for the preventer &#13;
    wire and upper pocket for the securing bolt were bent towards the inside, &#13;
    i.e. centre line, of the ramp. This bending under force is presumably the &#13;
    cause for the cracked metal between the upper pocket and ramp edge as explained &#13;
    further above under "locking devices".</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The lugs for both &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The upper flaps &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;

      - Nos. 5 and 6 were obviously forced apart and were now standing approximately &#13;
      horizontally with damage in between;<br/>&#13;
      - Nos. 7 and 8 were hanging down in undamaged condition with the lower parts &#13;
      slightly moved to port. <br/>&#13;
      The bell crank on port side was bent and broken with the wire controlling &#13;
      the flaps also broken. The starboard side bell crank is apparently intact. &#13;

      Between the upper transverse girder of the ramp and the second flap from &#13;
      starboard a <b>wooden plank</b> was found to be sticking.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The mating lugs &#13;

    areas, according to the ROV inspections on 02. and 09.10.94 compared to the &#13;
    results of the diving investigation on 03.12.94, are demon-strated by the &#13;
    drawing on the following page. It has to be borne in mind that the green shaded &#13;
    area containing the really heavy damage at the centre line of the transverse &#13;
    girders Nos. 3, 4, 5 as counted from the lower side of the ramp is not visible &#13;
    on the videos made on 02. and 09.10.94. This does not mean that it had not &#13;
    been there, but this particular area cannot be seen on the publicly available &#13;
    video footage, because these parts were cut and deleted from the respective &#13;
    videos handed over to this 'Group of Experts' by the members of the Finnish &#13;
    Commission in March 1995 as "raw material". - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>&#13;

    area represents the contours of the forepeak deck and it is obvious that the &#13;
    damage to the 2nd transverse girder as well as to the two inner vertical girders &#13;
    appears to have been caused by contact with the corresponding parts of the &#13;
    forepeak deck. Also the type of the deep and sharp indentations of the transverse &#13;
    and vertical girders, with local deformations to the adjacent structure, could &#13;
    confirm this. On the other hand the damage to the port vertical girder is &#13;
    comparatively weak, while the most heavy damage to the starboard vertical &#13;
    girder cannot have been caused by contact with the forepeak deck because the &#13;
    two ramp hinges on that side were to some extent intact. The doubts are further &#13;
    increased by the fact that the flatbar housings on the forepeak deck at the &#13;
    four contact areas should be pressed flat, which they were not, and that there &#13;
    should at least be heavy contact marks at the deck edges of the forepeak deck, &#13;
    which however are also missing.</font></p>&#13;

    pressed together to the plating which was severely buckled. To port and starboard &#13;
    of this very heavy damage the girder was also indented, but to a lesser extent. &#13;

    defor-mations, which are not visible to this extent on the videos of 02.10.94 &#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for the &#13;
    main damage to the underside of the ramp, respectively to the severe longitudinal &#13;
    bending of the whole ramp structure which was most probably caused by a very &#13;
    heavy weight pressing down the ramp from port to starboard and by which the &#13;
    very heavy distortions to the vertical and transverse girders of the ramp &#13;
    structure were created.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This could &#13;
    explain all the damages to the ramp structure except for Nos. 1, 10 and part &#13;
    of damages 13/14 to which reference is made in Chapter 32. It is worth mentioning &#13;
    here that there was no chance for the ramp to crash on the bulbous bow as &#13;
    long as the starboard ramp hinges were intact, which they were.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(5) The rails</b><br/>&#13;
    The bow ramp is fitted with two rails on each side as can be seen on the photo &#13;
    below.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg878.JPG" width="365" height="243"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Each rail consisted &#13;
    of three fixed sections welded to the raised tire-protection bar, i.e. 4 vertical &#13;
    stanchions with three horizontal rail bars in between. A fifth moveable section &#13;
    was fitted to the most forward stanchion. When the ramp was open these movable &#13;
    sections were swung forward and secured in this position by two pins fitting &#13;
    in corresponding holes. Before the ramp was closed, the movable sections were &#13;
    swung backwards and secured by the pins as can be seen on the above picture &#13;
    and the rails remained in this position during the sea voyage. Thus it has &#13;
    to be assumed that this was also the case during the last voyage. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As parts of &#13;
    the starboard rail, the 4th section with the attached 5th moveable section, &#13;
    were found on the seabed already on 02.10.94 by ROV "Jutta II" - see the image &#13;
    on the next page - the available footage has been evaluated for indications &#13;
    of the bow ramp rails. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious that &#13;
    it is the starboard side because the movable part is always fixed at the inside &#13;
    of the fourth section if the ramp is open, as visible here and it is also &#13;
    obvious that the lower, bent part was the part attached to the ramp. It is &#13;
    further apparent that the vertical stanchion had been bent and finally cracked &#13;
    off by a force acting from port to starboard. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The image below shows &#13;

    cut off at a level well below the adjacent mating pocket of the port upper &#13;
    securing bolt. Bending or cracking can be excluded due to the even surface &#13;
    of the stanchion which was actually a pipe. At the time of cutting the stanchion &#13;
    was bent to the starboard side. See image and drawings below.</font></p>&#13;

    below - and deeply engraved scoring marks at the starboard recess in the front &#13;
    bulkhead in way of the fastenings for the starboard ramp actuator indicate &#13;
    that the ramp had been more open and was subsequently closed - see the image &#13;
    on the next page. Since this area is not visible on the footage of 02.10.94, &#13;
    it is not possible to verify whether this opening and subsequent closing occurred &#13;

    that these pallets floated into this position at the very moment when the &#13;
    ramp was pushed closed by the visor while the sinking vessel was already heeling &#13;
    to 130/140°. It has also to be excluded that the pallets floated out of the &#13;
    jammed-in condition by themselves as visible on the footage made on 09.10.94. &#13;
    This means that it has to be assumed that the pallets were manually put into &#13;
    position to avoid total closure of the ramp at some stage and, further, that &#13;
    they probably floated away when the ramp was also manually opened further &#13;
    at sometime after the 09.10.94 but before 03.12.94.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- When diver &#13;

    wristwatch in the lower part of the ramp, i.e. in one compartment above the &#13;
    broken starboard hinges. It turned out that the watch belonged to diver 2 &#13;

    disappearing behind something solid, which is apparently not identical to &#13;
    the "sealing material", which had mostly disappeared by then. The rope can &#13;
    be seen coming back slightly deeper as if running through a lug. This is approximately &#13;
    the area where the lug was found on the 1996 video - see the image on the &#13;

      6 show either empty flatbar channels where the rubber packings were supposed &#13;
      to be - which is also confirmed by the image below - or show the rubber &#13;
      packing lying loosely on the flatbars into which they should be fitted and &#13;
      bolted. The evaluation of the video films - of which these 3 pictures are &#13;
      just a small selection - prove that the rubber packings were only in place &#13;
      at the starboard side from forward of the Atlantic lock to the "corner of &#13;
      the mouth" and these were in a rather poor condition. Along the whole port &#13;
      side up into the "corner of the mouth" there were no rubber packings. The &#13;
      diver followed the flatbar - channel for the rubber packings from the top &#13;
      of the starboard front bulkhead via the forepeak deck to the top of the &#13;
      port front bulkhead which is documented on video tape B40c. The two images &#13;
      below are just a confirmation of the findings explained above.</font></p>&#13;

      hammering marks were sustained over a longer period, viz. when the visor &#13;
      moved up and down in the sea state within the play of the locking devices, &#13;
      because the counter-pressure of the missing rubber packings was not existing &#13;
      to avoid such movements. The corresponding stempost of the visor was found &#13;

      has to be there in case the bow ramp had been fully open and did smash on &#13;

    opening for the manual side lock with the rubber packing to the left. Between &#13;
    opening and rubber packing the bulkhead is visibly bulged - see arrow - i.e. &#13;
    the bulkhead is pushed out around the opening for the manual hook and increasingly &#13;
    deeper down the bulkhead. This can be seen from the next image below - arrow &#13;

    "as-found" condition is demonstrated by 15 images and 2 photographs which &#13;

    were taken from the ROV video made on 9 October 1994, i.e. 12 days after the &#13;
    casualty. All fracture surfaces are heavily corroded. This is even more evident &#13;
    from the image below made from the ROV video from 02.10.94, i.e. only 4 days &#13;
    after the sinking, which shows the same corrosion to the fracture surfaces &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These pictures need &#13;
    to be commented as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The support &#13;
      bracket at the outer side of the lug (arrow 1) is larger than the original, &#13;
      which is evident because it overlaps the end of the welding seam (arrow &#13;
      2) which marks the end of the bushing. The support bracket is about 12 mm &#13;
      larger compared to the original one made according to the von Tell drawing &#13;
      No. 49111- 373.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The oblique &#13;
      end of the bracket is just burnt, not grinded (arrow 3). It is considered &#13;
      impossible that the bracket would have left blacksmith's shop of the Meyer &#13;
      Werft in such a condition - see also Subchapter 2.4.6; </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The remains of &#13;
      the welding seams at the outer side of the lug were made very unprofessionally &#13;
      when the lug was upright which allows the conclusion that the lug was fixed &#13;
      to the vessel as otherwise the welder would have laid the lug flat. This &#13;
      would have permitted easier welding and would have produced a qualified &#13;
      welding seam. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Qualified &#13;
    welders are able to identify if a welding seam was made when the components &#13;
    were lying flat or were standing upright. The starboard and the centre lugs &#13;
    were shown to one of the very qualified welders of Meyer Werft who identified &#13;
    the welding seams at the support bracket and on the outside of the starboard &#13;
    lug to be rather poor repair welds made when the lug was upright, i.e. fitted &#13;
    to the forepeak deck. See also Subchapter 2.4.6. - As the welds had been made &#13;
    when the lug was upright, i.e. welded to the vessel, it is excluded that they &#13;
    could have been made by Meyer Werft because the bushings were welded to the &#13;
    lugs in the workshop, i.e. the lugs had been lying flat. - See Subchapter &#13;
    2.4.6.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The welds are &#13;
      thin and interrupted, respectively cracked, because they are so thin, which &#13;
      is demonstrated by the corroded surface of the inner side of the lug normally &#13;
      covered by the bushing. As long as the welding seams are intact the space &#13;
      between bushing/lug is airtight, i.e. without oxygen, which was burnt by &#13;
      the heat of the welding process. This was obviously no more the case since &#13;
      some time before the bushing was torn off, because substantial corrosion &#13;
      was able to develop.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The forward &#13;
      and aft welding seams between bushing and support bracket are not connected &#13;
      at the outer end (or closed, as the welders say), thus water could penetrate. &#13;
      This confirms the unprofessionalism of the welder who did these repair welds. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Although the &#13;
      welding seams of the inside of the starboard lug and of both sides of the &#13;
      centre lug look much better, they have to be considered fill-up welds according &#13;
      to the Meyer Werft welders, because the welds are higher than the inside &#13;
      of the lug, i.e. the bushing was not resting in the lug, either because &#13;
      the bore was too big from the beginning and/or the lug became elongated &#13;
      as time went by. Therefore the welding seams were mainly used to cover the &#13;
      space between the lug and the bushing at the bottom side of the lugs and &#13;
      thus had only a reduced load-carrying capacity compared to the original &#13;
      as-built condition.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On &#13;
    26 June 1994 a passenger observed welding work being carried out underneath &#13;
    the open bow ramp while ESTONIA was in Stockholm. It is possible that the &#13;
    repair weldings explained above to starboard lug of the Atlantic lock were &#13;
    carried out then. See also Subchapter 12.5.</font></p>&#13;

      Stenström, because allegedly the helicopter taking the Swedes back home &#13;
      could not carry the weight ashore of both the bolt and the ship's bell. &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The drawing previously, &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The contact &#13;
      plate (Arrow 1) had originally been straight as can be seen from the above &#13;
      drawing which is copied from the original von Tell drawing 4911-373 dated &#13;
      09.10.79. It has been confirmed by the von Tell representative G.Todsen &#13;
      (Enclosure 2.4.2.21 - Statement G.Todsen) as well as by the BV-surveyor &#13;
      G.Lohmann in a personal discussion that the Atlantic lock had been installed &#13;
      as per approved drawings. Consequently the contact plate was originally &#13;
      straight.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - This was no &#13;
      more the case at the time of the casualty as can be seen from images 13/15 &#13;
      and from the image below made from the ROV videos of 02.10.94 and 09.10.94, &#13;
      because evidently the contact plate was bent from starboard to port when &#13;
      the bolt was in original condition. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explanation &#13;
    for the bent contact plate of the bolt was presented by the last chairman &#13;
    of the JAIC and its Estonian part, Uno Laur, already at a meeting on 17.01.95 &#13;
    in his office in Tallinn when also a member of this 'Group of Experts' was &#13;
    present. He was asked whether he had an explanation for the many fresh footprints &#13;
    on the 2nd and 3rd stringers inside the visor and he replied as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The inside of &#13;
      the visor was not tight and filled quickly with seawater up to outboard &#13;
      level when the vessel was on full speed at sea.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All hydraulic &#13;
      installations, i.e. also the actuators of the Atlantic lock, the bow ramp &#13;
      and the visor were leaking. This caused hydraulic oil to float on the water &#13;
      surface inside the visor. </font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As soon as the &#13;
      vessel reduced speed and consequently the bow wave became smaller, the water &#13;
      streamed out of the visor and the hydraulic oil settled on the stringers, &#13;
      bottom, etc. - as explained in Chapter 30.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the Atlantic &#13;
      lock could no more be closed hydraulically already since some time before &#13;
      the casualty (probably since the ice winter, March/April 1994) crew members &#13;
      had to go down inside the visor each time before arrival and after departure &#13;
      Tallinn and hammer the bolt open respectively closed through the deformed &#13;
      lugs of the Atlantic lock. Thus they walked from forward to aft and back &#13;
      over the stringers through the freshly settled oil which caused the footprints &#13;
      as can be seen on the next pictures. </font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above was &#13;
      confirmed by another participant of the meeting, Captain Arvi Myyryläinen, &#13;
      then Hull Manager of The Pohjola Insurance Group, Helsinki. His statement &#13;
      is attached as Enclosure 12.5.175. </font></li>&#13;

    on the next page was made mid January 1995. It shows a view into the visor &#13;

    on the next page shows in detail that the footprints were so fresh and clear &#13;
    that even the size of the rubber boots could have been identified. It also &#13;
    demonstrates that there must have been quite some activities down in the visor &#13;
    before the last arrival and after the last departure from Tallinn which cannot &#13;
    just be explained with one or two men going down to hammer the bolt of the &#13;
    Atlantic lock open and closed. There were certainly also other activities &#13;
    going on as will be explained later. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    last time the hydraulic oil settled down on stringer 3 has been before arrival &#13;
    Tallinn in the morning of 27.09.94 when the speed was reduced, the bow wave &#13;
    became small and the water streamed out of the visor. Thereafter the crew &#13;
    entered the visor to hammer open the Atlantic Lock and possibly to carry out &#13;
    other activities. The crew went again inside the visor after departure to &#13;
    hammer the bolt into the Atlantic Lock lugs and to carry out other activities. &#13;
    Subsequently the vessel picked up speed, the bow wave was raising again and &#13;
    the inside of the visor filled within the following hours more or less completely &#13;
    with water, which only left with the lifting of the visor after the casualty. &#13;
    Consequently the fresh footsteps originate from before arrival and after departure &#13;
    on 27.09.94.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The opening movement &#13;
    of the bolt was from starboard to port and the contact plate was bent from &#13;
    starboard to port. Therefore it has to be assumed that the crew hammered against &#13;
    the contact plate to open the bolt, because there is no other possibility &#13;
    of forcing the bolt open. The hammering marks on the plate are clearly visible. &#13;
    When closing the bolt they hammered directly against the bolt (which is not &#13;
    possible for opening), i.e. against the 2 lugs between which the piston rod &#13;
    of the hydraulic cylinder was fastened by a little bolt. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As can be seen &#13;
    by the next pictures both lugs were bent to the respective outsides and the &#13;
    piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder was also bent.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Whilst the bending &#13;
    of the lugs is doubtless due to the powerful hammering by crew members when &#13;
    trying to force the bolt through the deformed lugs of the Atlantic lock, it &#13;
    is evident from the hammering marks on the contact plate, as visible on the &#13;
    next image, that they sometimes also hammered against this plate when trying &#13;
    to open the bolt. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following &#13;
    image, taken from the Part-Report of the JAIC, shows these lugs to be full &#13;
    of hammering marks, which are shining like new, without any traces of corrosion, &#13;
    although the fracture surfaces of the broken lugs are heavily corroded. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It appears strange &#13;
    that hammering marks, undoubtedly originating from hammering about 6 hours &#13;
    before the casualty, appear without any corrosion as can be seen on the above &#13;
    image, whilst fracture surfaces, which are said to originate from fracturing &#13;
    at the time of the casualty, i.e. were exposed to seawater only about 6 hours &#13;
    later, are severely corroded as can also be seen on the same image. This raises &#13;
    doubt whether the lugs of the Atlantic Lock really fractured only during the &#13;
    casualty or much earlier already. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- Further detailed &#13;
    explanations: </b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A further consequence &#13;
    of the water-filled visor were repeated problems with the magnetic limit switches &#13;
    of the Atlantic lock which had replaced the mechanical sensors sometime in &#13;
    1985/86 - see Subchapter 3.4 - and which controlled the red/green indicator &#13;
    lights of the control panel on the car deck (see Subchapter 2.6.4). These &#13;
    limit switches were most probably damaged by ice hacking inside the visor &#13;
    in winter 1994. When this was realised by those in charge and when it further &#13;
    turned out that the Atlantic lock could no more be operated hydraulically &#13;
    because the lugs were deformed also by ice hacking and the visor was misaligned, &#13;
    it was decided to dismount the damaged limit switches completely and the cables &#13;
    were cut off. The video prints below show the cut off cables and the empty &#13;
    sensor plate.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg912.JPG" width="370" height="321"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The motivation for &#13;
    not replacing the dismounted magnetic limit switches was primarily the rather &#13;
    high price for new ones and the apparent fact that crew members had to go &#13;
    down anyway after the closing respectively before the opening of the visor &#13;
    to close respectively open the bolt manually by hammering, thus there was &#13;
    a direct control and no remote control was required.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Neither B.V. &#13;
    nor the E.N.M.B. were informed about this severe violation of safety rules &#13;
    which rendered the vessel initially unseaworthy and should have caused B.V. &#13;
    to withdraw the class in hindsight.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When &#13;
    the information outlined above was brought to the attention of B.V. they invited &#13;
    the owners, i.e. N&amp;T, to comment on the dismounted limit switches and the &#13;
    obviously cut-off cables. Although the images from the underwater videos demonstrate &#13;
    quite clearly that the limit switches and cables were not torn off in the &#13;
    course of the casualty sequence-of-events, B.V. apparently finally believed &#13;
    the many crew witnesses stating that the installation had been complete and &#13;
    in proper working order only a few days before the catastrophe. Also the JAIC &#13;
    finally accepted the explanations by N&amp;T/the crew, although earlier there &#13;
    had been different opinions. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Summary of Facts &#13;
    presented on the Atlantic Lock:</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) All three lugs &#13;
    evidently failed in the forward/upward direction, which is only possible if &#13;
    the visor hinges were broken before - see Subchapter 34.2 - Results of the &#13;
    Finite Element Analysis of the Visor - because as long as the visor is attached &#13;
    to all five respectively seven fixing points the force direction is aft/upwards &#13;
    and the load on the Atlantic lock is only in the range of 50/60 ts.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The lugs failed &#13;
    in their thinnest sections and the upper fracture surfaces of all 3 lugs look &#13;
    more or less the same while the fracture surfaces of the lower ones look totally &#13;
    different, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard &#13;
      lug lower fracture runs obliquely from the upper point of the fracture towards &#13;
      the lower forward side of the lug and the fracture surface is severely corroded.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The centre &#13;
      lug lower fracture looks completely different because the fracture runs &#13;
      horizontally from the point of fracture on the inside towards the outside &#13;
      or vice versa. Also this fracture surface is severely corroded. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- according &#13;
      to the available videos the port lug lower fracture has apparently been &#13;
      subject to pounding. The initial condition cannot be determined anymore &#13;
      because the lug was destroyed for testing purposes. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The upper part &#13;
    of the starboard lug was found to be bent to starboard, while the upper parts &#13;
    of the centre and port lugs were straight. The lower part of the starboard &#13;
    lug was straight while the lower parts of the centre and port lugs were bent &#13;
    to port.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The welding &#13;
    seams also show quite different pictures, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard &#13;
      lug and the support bracket: <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding &#13;
      seams between the support bracket, which was much larger than the original &#13;
      and the support bushing as well as the welding seams at the outer side of &#13;
      the lug between the lug and the support bushing were obviously very unprofessionally &#13;
      made repair welds when the lug was in upright position which allows the &#13;
      conclusion that the lugs were fixed to the forepeak deck when being repair &#13;
      welded.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding &#13;
      seams on the inner side between the lug and the support bushing look much &#13;
      better but are according to the professional welders of Meyer Werft so-called &#13;
      fill-up welds and are much thinner than the initial welds were, viz. only &#13;
      about 3 mm whereas the initial welds were 7-8 mm - see also Subchapter 2.4.6<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the centre &#13;
      lug has also fill-up welding seams on both sides of only about 3 mm thickness;<br/>&#13;
      - the port lug could not be examined since it was destroyed for testing &#13;
      purposes on behalf of the JAIC. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) In summary of &#13;
    items (1) to (4) the following has to be considered established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The visible &#13;
      welding seams on the starboard and centre lugs and the support bracket of &#13;
      the starboard lug were not original, thus it has to be concluded that the &#13;
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were no more the original ones installed by Meyer &#13;
      Werft - see also Subchapter 3.3.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding &#13;
      seams in way of the outer side of the starboard lug including support bracket/support &#13;
      bushing were poor quality repair welds made when the lug was in upright &#13;
      condition.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The other &#13;
      welding seams between lugs/bushing were fill-up welds of just 3 mm instead &#13;
      of 7-8 mm in the original condition.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In particular &#13;
      the lower fracture surface of the starboard lug showed severe corrosion &#13;
      even though blank metal without any corrosion could be seen on the insides &#13;
      of the lugs and on the upper part of the bolt despite these parts should &#13;
      have become exposed to seawater at the same time as the lower fracture surface &#13;
      of the starboard lug. This could indicate that the fracture - at least of &#13;
      the starboard lug - existed already before the casualty.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Due to &#13;
      the above-explained changes compared to the original condition the load-carrying &#13;
      capacity of the complete installation had been considerably reduced.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The locking &#13;
      bolt showed 2 areas of contact indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully &#13;
      extended and sometimes only partly when in locked position which indicates &#13;
      misalignment between the lugs on the vessel and/or between the lugs on the &#13;
      vessel and the visor lug. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The steel &#13;
      plate attached to the bolt was hammered bent from starboard to port since &#13;
      this is the only way to move the bolt from closed to open position by means &#13;
      of a hammer which confirms the above. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The lugs &#13;
      between which the piston rod was fitted to the bolt were hammered apart &#13;
      since hammering on these lugs was the most effective way to hammer the bolt &#13;
      from open to closed position which further confirms the above.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the &#13;
      three lugs of the Atlantic lock were deformed and misaligned to such an &#13;
      extent that the Atlantic lock could no more be locked/unlocked by means &#13;
      of the hydraulic actuator remotely controlled from the control panel on &#13;
      the car deck, it had to be locked/unlocked by crew members by means of hammering. &#13;
      See Enclosure 12.5.175.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The sensor &#13;
      plate was empty and there are no indications that the limit switches had &#13;
      been fitted to it at or shortly before the casualty. The inside of the drilled &#13;
      holes show corrosion indicating that the limit switches had been dismounted &#13;
      some time before the casualty when also the cables were cut.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The scoring &#13;
      marks and removed paint at the upper forward side of the sensor plate do &#13;
      originate from hammering by crew members to bend the plate further aft, &#13;
      i.e. away from the hammering area of the bolt which is a further confirmation &#13;
      for the above. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the &#13;
      bolt - after having been recovered by the divers - was thrown back into &#13;
      the sea by a member of the JAIC and the sensor plate - although having been &#13;
      burnt off by the diver - was thrown away and not brought to the surface, &#13;
      these important pieces of evidence could not be examined. </font></p>&#13;

  The Car Deck</b> </font></p>&#13;
<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Very little is known &#13;
    about the inside of the car deck except for the observations made when the &#13;
    diver went down (up) the starboard inner bulkhead, inside the ramp towards &#13;
    the car deck. A lot of pallets and dunnage were noted to be piled up to the &#13;
    left of his way, with other debris and what appeared to be parts of the ramp &#13;
    rails mixed between. Behind the debris at least one, probably two big holes &#13;
    in the bulkhead are visible which will be discussed in Chapter 32. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper &#13;
    part of the ramp opening was considerably damaged indicating that something &#13;
    big had smashed against it, no scoring marks are visible and the area of the &#13;
    inner bulkhead is covered by the above-mentioned debris. It is possible that &#13;
    this damage was caused by the visor - see Chapter 31 - during the casualty &#13;
    sequence-of-events.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The condition of &#13;
    the bow ramp flaps on the car deck side have already been explained in the &#13;
    previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - and the big hole noted in the port &#13;
    inner bulkhead below the control panel and adjacent to the port outer ramp &#13;
    hinge will be discussed in Chapter 32. In spite of various attempts and although &#13;
    the supervisor frequently said so, the ROV was apparently never inside the &#13;
    car deck according to the evaluation of Disengage - see Disengage Report Subchapter &#13;
    34.6 - and if the ROV actually should have been inside the car deck it definitely &#13;
    did not enter it via the opening at the bow ramp but then it must have been &#13;
    through such a big hole in the starboard shell plating that the edges were &#13;
    not visible while the ROV moved through. This is doubtful but cannot be excluded &#13;
    because the relevant part of the Sprint ROV video tape B40b has been cut several &#13;
    times. - See Subchapter 34.6. in any event on the uncensored part of this &#13;
    tape cement bags on pallets shrinked by plastic foil and other cargo parts, &#13;
    however no truck or trailers, can bee seen which then has to be on the seabed.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This immediately &#13;
    raises the question of how they got there because it is most unlikely that &#13;
    this cargo originates from another vessel as it looks rather new and unaffected &#13;
    by sediments. It can also be excluded that the cargo fell out of the open &#13;
    bow ramp when the vessel was upside down because she was then down by the &#13;
    stern and it is physically impossible for pallets to move off some truck or &#13;
    trailer on to the car deck and then ahead on to the bow ramp and then to fall &#13;
    off the bow ramp. This leaves a sufficiently big hole in the shell plating &#13;
    in way of the forward starboard side of the car deck which indeed cannot be &#13;
    excluded and is - as a matter of fact - the only possibility. As the observations &#13;
    described above were made by the ROV on 3 December 1994, i.e. more than 2 &#13;
    months after the casualty, there are two possibilities, viz.: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) heavy objects &#13;
      from inside the car deck crashed against the shell plating and broke through &#13;
      it either during the big heel, which is unlikely, and/or subsequently<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) a hole &#13;
      was blown or flame-cut from the outside into the car deck to get access &#13;
      after the casualty. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to be able &#13;
    to explain further observations on the car deck by survivors also the fire-fighting &#13;
    system installed here - a sprinkler system called Drencher system - has to &#13;
    be explained as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck &#13;
      there were also heat-sensors installed, which activated control lights on &#13;
      the bridge indicating the particular area. By pushing a respective bottom &#13;
      the watch officer started the fire pump and activated one or more quick-opening &#13;
      valves of the sprinkler system installed underneath the car deck ceiling, &#13;
      i.e. below the 4th deck. This sprinkler fire protection system was spraying &#13;
      water out of nozzles under high pressure all over the area and the fire &#13;
      pump was continuously pumping water into the system. This sprinkler pump &#13;
      could also be activated from the ECR and from the sprinkler room (B-deck &#13;
      level in the aft part of the centre casing). It was connected to the emergency &#13;
      generator. This means that this pump has been running until the vessel was &#13;
      more or less on the side. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this connection &#13;
      the observation of passenger Juuse Veljo is of importance who testified &#13;
      among others <i>"On my way down the port side in about the middle of the &#13;
      ship I reached the fender bar and heard the noise of pumps. While I was &#13;
      still sitting on the edge the light started to blink."</i> - See his statement &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    emergency generator then still running was supplying power to three pumps, &#13;
    viz.: the bilge pump, the fire pump and the sprinkler pump. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is possible that &#13;
    the sprinkler pump was then still running together with the bilge pump, which &#13;
    according to Margus Treu, Henrik Sillaste and Hannes Kadak was also running &#13;
    already since or even before the big heel. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Furthermore there &#13;

    dated 29.09.94 Turku - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.263.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.2.3.263.</a> Treu believed that this water jet came from the partly open &#13;
    bow ramp, which however is not possible because the camera is fitted at the &#13;
    forward part of the centre casing underneath the ceiling. The distance to &#13;
    the bow ramp is 25 m and the height above car deck is about 5 m - see the &#13;
    pictures below taken on board the near-sister DIANA II where the camera was &#13;
    installed as on ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can thus be excluded &#13;
    that water penetrating the bow ramp at that relatively early stage could have &#13;
    reached the camera in such high position as much as the car deck between bow &#13;
    ramp and camera was full of trucks and cars.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is much more &#13;
    likely that the camera lens was hit by a jet of water from the sprinkler installation &#13;
    which had been activated manually in the forward part of the car deck.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) It has been &#13;
    explained in the previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - that the lower &#13;
    part of the ramp in way of the two flaps in the middle was noted to be reddish/brown &#13;
    with the flaps being bent and distorted and possible damage to car deck plating. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The passenger &#13;
    Bengt Nilsson has testified that he saw white powder and foam inside the centre &#13;
    casing on car deck level next to the 4th car deck door from forward on starboard &#13;
    side. He rushed past this door on his way up when the vessel heeled abruptly &#13;
    to starboard and he had to hold with his hands against the wall when he noted &#13;
    the above. It was so fresh that the foam was still running down the wall. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The coded fire &#13;
    alarm for the crew "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" was heard from the loud speakers, &#13;
    though only after the big heel when there was already full panic. It meant &#13;
    that Fire Group No. 1 had to assemble below the starboard bridge wing on deck &#13;
    8 and Fire Group No. 2 had to assemble on the car deck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) There are indications &#13;
    that the crew had been active on the car deck before the big heel. See the &#13;
    statement of Altti Hakanpää - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.333.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.3.333</a> and the different statements of Margus Treu in respect of his &#13;
    seeing Silver Linde on the car deck - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.261.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures &#13;

    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It is certain &#13;
    that the crew knows much more about what happened on the car deck, but remain &#13;
    silent, so far. It has to be assumed that this knowledge relates to the circumstances &#13;
    described in Chapter 32 - Unexplained Damage. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This particular area &#13;
    of the wreck above the mudline was carefully examined by divers and ROV because &#13;
    a surprisingly big part was accessible, much more than it could be assumed &#13;
    with a vessel lying on her starboard side. The reason is, as demonstrated &#13;
    by the drawings below taken from the Smit-Tak Report - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    27.410</a> - that the superstructure was buried into the sea bottom. Therefore &#13;
    the wreck had a list of about 120° with the bottom up and a substantial part &#13;
    of the starboard hull side was accessible above the bilge strake partly up &#13;
    to car deck level.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that &#13;
    over the whole length of the wreck the starboard shell plating in way of the &#13;
    0-deck is accessible which includes the heeling tank and stabiliser pocket &#13;
    areas. The same is true for the 1st deck which is accessible in most parts &#13;
    while the car deck can only be reached in way of section D, which is aft of &#13;
    the bridge. The drawing on the next page - also taken from the Smit-Tak Report &#13;
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    12.4.2.151</a> - there must have been a connection to the outside. As the &#13;
    port side of the shell plating is apparently undamaged according to the ROV &#13;
    inspections on 02.10.94 and 09.10.94 it has to be assumed that there must &#13;

    respective video material is available. The "official" mudline video is, however, &#13;
    censored, i.e. the relevant parts were deleted - see also the Disengage Report &#13;
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    34.6.434.</a> Nevertheless, careful evaluation of the available mudline video &#13;
    does reveal very substantial damage to the starboard shell plating and bottom &#13;
    plating above and below the bilge keel as demonstrated by the images below.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking at the &#13;
    images presented here it is difficult to assume that this vessel had been &#13;
    in drydock only 8 months before, because the starboard side is really in a &#13;
    very bad condition, actually much worse as it is possible to demonstrate by &#13;
    images. Very deep indentations between the frames and deep scoring marks, &#13;
    partly not even corroded, are the rule, however, in some particular areas &#13;
    the plating is even holed as e.g. can be seen from the image below. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Enhancement by means &#13;
    of special equipment confirmed indeed that the plating is holed - See the &#13;
    enhancement below.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the damage &#13;
    appearance it has to be concluded that the plate was severely corroded, i.e. &#13;
    the hole was neither caused by an impact of ex- or implosion but by corrosion. &#13;
    This is easily possible if the coating and/or anode protection of a ballast &#13;
    water tank, e.g. a heeling tank, was not in order. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following two &#13;
    images show an area which is apparently also holed, but not by corrosion because &#13;
    the edges are too sharp.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In any event the &#13;
    ferry ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on her last voyage with one or more starboard &#13;
    ballast water tanks, possibly even the heeling tank, open to the sea. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated above &#13;
    - see Chapter 17 - revised stability calculations showed that the vessel must &#13;
    have had about 200 ts additional weight on the starboard side which could &#13;
    not be pumped. The theoretical possibilities of unconfirmed flooding of compartments &#13;
    through holes to the outside was discussed as the reader may remember. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The possibility &#13;
    now turns to a fact. The vessel had holes in her underwater shell plating. &#13;
    The obvious effect on the seaworthiness of the ferry needs not to be discussed. &#13;
    The fact that the JAIC, having worked on the interpretation of those videos, &#13;
    does not mention anything in this regard, is undebatable too. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In January &#13;
    1994 the ESTONIA was fitted with stabilisers of make Brown Brothers which &#13;
    had allegedly been in operation at the time of the casualty. According to &#13;
    3rd engineer Margus Treu, the fins should retract automatically at speeds &#13;
    below 4 kn, therefore he does not believe that survivors could have seen the &#13;
    port stabiliser still out when the vessel was already almost on the side - &#13;
    see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.271.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure &#13;

    probability Margus Treu is right because only after proper questioning of &#13;
    the survivors Pierre Thiger, Tony Spuhl and Mats Hillerström did it turn out &#13;
    that what they believed to have been the stabiliser was much too much forward &#13;
    to assume it could have been the stabiliser. They saw something big, partly &#13;
    white, partly dark, vertically bigger than transverse, which was moving in/out &#13;
    and/or up/down, very far forward, almost at the bow. They saw it still when &#13;
    the vessel was on the side already. The statement of Pierre Thiger taken on &#13;
    08.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.414 and the statement of Tony Spuhl &#13;
    taken on 10.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.415. The statement of Mats &#13;
    Hillerström is not yet available. The actual stabiliser, however, is installed &#13;
    in a pocket behind the heeling tank on 0-dek level, i.e. about midships. When &#13;
    the witnesses were informed accordingly they categorically denied having seen &#13;
    anything moving in this area. This leads to the conclusion that the survivors &#13;
    had seen the visor, then still hanging on the bow ramp with the bottom attached &#13;
    to the forepeak deck and ice- knife of the bulbous bow.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This leaves &#13;
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk who has stated - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.1.251.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.2.1.251</a> - that the stern was down to the stabiliser fin level. But &#13;
    he did not say that the fin was out. Therefore, it has to be assumed that &#13;
    the survivors actually meant the visor when they mentioned the stabiliser &#13;
    during the last stage before leaving the vessel.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event &#13;
    the port stabiliser fin was found to be in its pocket during the ROV inspection &#13;

  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard stabiliser &#13;
    is not visible on the available footage - although the area was accessible &#13;
    and frequently inspected by ROVs and divers - because the respective parts &#13;
    in the available video films were deleted. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The only mention &#13;
    of the starboard stabiliser is made in the Video Tape Log concerning Video &#13;
    No. RW/SEMiI/EST/R/94/001 - General Subject: Mudline Depth Survey by ROV UF0316 &#13;
    - on 04.12.94 - the mudline video - where it is stated: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»51.58 - Follow &#13;
    curve of hull at forward of <b>stabiliser</b> 1 mtr gap from hull to M/L (mudline) &#13;
    straight through.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the stated &#13;
    depth of 80.7 m before and 81.8 m after the above entry, it has to be concluded &#13;
    that it was the deep starboard side because above the port stabiliser there &#13;
    is only about 50 m of water.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> If the stabiliser &#13;
    should be there in its pocket, why did the JAIC then censor the video? Probably &#13;
    it is not there because there have been and still are continuous rumours that &#13;
    the starboard stabiliser had not been installed properly in January 1994 - &#13;
    see Subchapter 12.5.5 - and ever since did malfunction from time to time and &#13;
    consequently might have broken off on the night of the casualty due to a too &#13;
    weak construction. In this connection the statement of the passenger from &#13;
    the 1st deck, Bengt Nilsson, recently taken in Stockholm - see Enclosure 29.6.416 &#13;
    - is of relevance, because he explains the metallic crack-ing/breaking noises &#13;
    heard by him when still lying in his bed as having come exactly from the direction &#13;
    where the starboard stabiliser fin had been installed. This indicates that &#13;
    the fin could have broken off. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Alternatively the &#13;
    stabiliser fin could have broken off by the object sliding against the vessel's &#13;
    starboard side by which the scraping noises were caused. The noise scenario &#13;
    for Bengt Nilsson would have been the same. Therefore the video footage showing &#13;
    the ROV inspection of the sea bottom was analysed and the following two images &#13;
    were found which could show parts of the stabiliser fin. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image &#13;
    is a single frame from a cut tape which vaguely shows something long on the &#13;
    seabed which the Finnish Commission did not want the public to see in detail.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has &#13;
    to be concluded that the <b>port stabiliser</b> in all probability moved into &#13;
    its pocket when the speed dropped below 4 kn which had been the case already &#13;
    before the big heel. It has further to be concluded that the object seen by &#13;
    some of the survivors far forward on the port side, which was moving in/out &#13;
    or up/down, was most likely the visor. These observations were still being &#13;
    made when the vessel was already on her side, i.e. at 01.30 hours or later. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the <b>starboard &#13;
    stabiliser</b> there are strong indications that it broke off or was broken &#13;
    off and is resting on the sea bottom now. In both cases a substantial water &#13;
    ingress into the engine room - at least 2 watertight compart-ments were affected &#13;
    - would have been the result for which there are also indications, because &#13;
    Henrik Sillaste has testified that the bilge pumps were running and Margus &#13;
    Treu has stated they were trying to pump water out of the ship. As it is not &#13;
    possible to pump water from the car deck they can only have pumped from 1st &#13;
    deck and 0-deck. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ROV tape made &#13;
    on 02.10.94 indicates that the starboard stern ramp is slightly open as can &#13;
    be seen on the adjacent image. It shows the upper inner side. The explanation &#13;
    for this slight opening was given already in Subchapter 21.3.3 by the statement &#13;
    of Rolf Sörman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.3.335.1</a> - who, as well as his seminar colleagues, were disturbed &#13;
    to such extent by hydraulic noises that they gave up their conference at 21.45 &#13;
    hours ET.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the 2nd main &#13;
    hydraulic station was located at the starboard side aft on the car deck level &#13;
    directly below the conference area this is the only installation able to produce &#13;
    the explained disturbing noise level. It can furthermore be reasonably assumed &#13;
    that the hydraulic pumps had been started and kept running to open the starboard &#13;
    stern ramp slightly by means of the ice breaking cylinders and keep the ramp &#13;
    in this position by operating the control time and again in the closing mode &#13;
    to press the ramp against the ice breaking cylinders as it would otherwise &#13;
    more open/close due to the very hard pitching of the ferry. The slight opening &#13;
    of the starboard stern ramp allowed the excessive water on the car deck, continuously &#13;
    penetrating through the unclosed bow ramp from the water filled visor, to &#13;
    run out at the stern. This worked, of course, only as long as the ferry had &#13;
    a stern trim and a starboard list. Both was the case until about 23.30 hours &#13;
    when the visor was more or less full and the trim changed to down by head. &#13;
    For further details see Chapter 31 - The Casualty Scenario. The pictures below &#13;
    show the stern ramp arrangements in port. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed &#13;
    that the starboard stern ramp was completely unlocked as it otherwise could &#13;
    not be slightly open and that the reason for this slightly open condition &#13;
    is the almost upside down condition of the wreck. It has further to be assumed &#13;
    that the stern ramp has been much more open during casualty sequence-of-events &#13;
    because latest after the shut-down of the auxiliary diesels the hydraulic &#13;
    pumps stopped since not being connected to the emergency generator. This means &#13;
    that subsequently the starboard stern ramp slowly opened completely or more &#13;
    or less completely while the ferry heeled more and more to starboard which &#13;
    led to massive water ingress onto the car deck and through the big lift opening &#13;
    at the aft end of the centre casing also into the large provision area in &#13;
    the aft of deck 1 and so on. This is most probably the explanation for the &#13;
    ferry sinking by the stern. </font></p>&#13;

    to be expected to the bulkheads surrounding the forward void space on starboard &#13;

    opening at forecastle deck level to the hinges respectively lower flaps of &#13;
    the bow ramp, then along the flaps to the port side and up the port side of &#13;
    the ramp to the port opening, he was instructed only to look for the securing &#13;
    bolts and mating boxes of the bow ramp and that was exactly what he did, thereby &#13;
    ignoring completely most relevant damage areas. Unfortunately the quality &#13;
    of the footage is very poor and thus the images are rather foggy. Nevertheless &#13;
    the important findings should be understandable to the reader the following &#13;

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3">33.1<br/>&#13;
    The "DIANA II" Incident in January 1993</font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As this relatively &#13;
    minor incident was made into a near catastrophe by the Nordic media with the &#13;
    visor allegedly almost lost, clarification was needed and thus the matter &#13;
    was also investigated by this 'Group of Experts' with the following result:<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">DIANA II was &#13;
    delivered by Meyer Werft in 1979 as forerunner and near-sister of the ESTONIA. &#13;
    The DIANA II as well as the VIKING SALLY (later ESTONIA) were trading in the &#13;
    Viking Line service between Stockholm-Mariehamn-Turku until 1990. From the &#13;
    chief mate Karl Ole Lindroos, who had practically been on board from the time &#13;
    of delivery until 1990, as well as from the mate and master Thorsten Söder, &#13;
    who served in this rank for many years, the following information has been &#13;
    received:</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was well known &#13;
    to all navigators that the bow visor was the most sensitive part of the vessel &#13;
    and was endangered in head-on seas at too high speed.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor was the &#13;
    responsibility of the chief mate who also opened and closed it. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were always &#13;
    problems at the time of opening and closing the bolt of the Atlantic lock, &#13;
    so that the bolt was finally thinned by 5 mm. After the visor had once been &#13;
    lowered with already closed bolt of the Atlantic lock, the bolt had to be &#13;
    renewed. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before it was possible &#13;
    to open the locking devices it was necessary to press the visor hydraulically &#13;
    down as otherwise the bolts could not have been opened respectively closed &#13;
    hydraulically against the pressure of the rubber packings.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the winter &#13;
    time there were always problems with the rubber packings being frozen to the &#13;
    visor bottom.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It often occurred &#13;
    that the visor closed with a loud "bang" as the man at the operating panel &#13;
    could not see the respective position of the visor.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> About one year &#13;
    before changing from the Slite Line to the Trelleborg-Rostock Line (TR Line) &#13;
    the pistons of the hydraulic cylinders were newly coated.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the bankruptcy &#13;
    of Slite Line in 1992 DIANA II was taken over by TR Line on basis of a bareboat. &#13;
    At first the Slite crew remained partly on board. Thorsten Söder and Lennart &#13;
    Elfors remained masters and Karl Ole Lindroos was one of the two chief mates &#13;
    for several months.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was &#13;
    engaged in the Rostock-Trelleborg service and made three trips daily, two &#13;
    of which were carried out during the daylight at full speed and one during &#13;
    the night with the speed reduced to ca. 12 kn. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the morning of<b> &#13;
    16 January 1993</b> during the voyage from Rostock to Trelleborg - i.e. two &#13;
    days after the hurricane in which the JAN HEWELIUSZ sank - there was again &#13;
    a storm of Bft. 10 blowing. Captain Söder was already on board the DIANA II &#13;
    to take-over the command from Captain Elfors after arrival in Trelleborg. &#13;
    The vessel proceeded through the very rough sea at ca. 12 kn. The chief mates &#13;
    Lindroos and Hartwigsson were on their handing-over round just in the forward &#13;
    part of the car deck when they noticed water leaking through the bow ramp. &#13;
    After the vessel had reached the shelter of the shore, both mates entered &#13;
    the inside of the visor through the hatch on the forecastle deck and found &#13;
    considerable damage to the hydraulic side locks (the manual side locks were &#13;
    not engaged) as well as to the Atlantic lock. After arrival the Classification &#13;
    Society B.V., Sjöfartsverket as well as TR Line were immediately informed &#13;
    and the responsible TR inspector instructed the master to have the damage &#13;
    repaired prior to the next departure.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ship's command &#13;
    entered the following remarks into the logbook:</font> &#13;

    of the B.V. surveyor, Captain Söder informed Sjöfarts-inspektionen Malmö - &#13;
    Åke Sjöblom - and invited them for survey. However, due to lack of time this &#13;
    was allegedly not possible and Sjöblom confirmed that the survey carried out &#13;
    by B.V. was sufficient and the repairs would be inspected later. Actually &#13;
    this was performed ca. three months later by the Safety Inspector Nilsson, &#13;
    according to the logbook entry.</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The B.V. lawyer &#13;

</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»According to &#13;
      the Captain in command of the DIANA II two officers discovered the damages &#13;
      at sea. For some time it had been "wet" on the forward ramp and crew members &#13;
      at sea went down between the forward ramp and the visor to see if the packing &#13;
      was leaking significantly. When they went down, the damages to the visor &#13;
      were discovered. On arrival at Trelleborg on 16 January 1993, they had a &#13;
      close look while the visor was opened. Thereafter the repairs were ordered &#13;
      through TR-Line in Trelleborg. The captain said that the weather had been &#13;
      bad for a few days, 15-25 m/s high waves, and it was dark. Thus, the damages &#13;
      might have happened several days before the 16 January 1993. He does not &#13;
      know when or under what circumstances the damages were suffered. The captain &#13;
      advised the chief surveyor of Malmö Inspectorate about the damages on 16 &#13;
      January 1993 by telephone.« </i></font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the &#13;
    ship's command the torn off starboard lug was lost. This is possible as first &#13;
    the lug hangs on the bolt of the hydraulic locking device and after opening &#13;
    the same it falls into the water. As noticed from the letter of the B.V. lawyer &#13;
    Johnsson, the repairs had already been commenced when the B.V. surveyor boarded &#13;
    the vessel. Thus practically neither the class nor the safety board ever saw &#13;
    the damage in its original condition. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ship's &#13;
    command was unable to attribute the damage to a special occurrence, such as &#13;
    a hard blow of the sea. Therefore the TR Line inspector Griesmaier is of the &#13;
    opinion that the damage to the locking devices occurred over a longer period. &#13;
    This would be in conformity with among other things the statements of the &#13;
    chief mate Karl Ole Lindroos.</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> DIANA II remained &#13;
    in charter with TR Line until the end of September 1994. Since June 1994 Nordström &#13;
    &amp; Thulin had become interested in the ship, in order to take her into their &#13;
    Stockholm-Tallinn service in addition to the ESTONIA. First inspections were &#13;
    carried out which included checking of the B.V. survey reports on board, thus &#13;
    inspector Hobro saw the B.V. report concerning the broken/cracked locks of &#13;
    the visor. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the ESTONIA &#13;
    sank, the take-over was quickly performed. On 29 Sept-ember 1994 in the presence &#13;
    of the B.V. surveyor Kirchhoff and the N&amp;T inspector Hobro, all locking devices &#13;
    were opened and closed with closed visor, the indicator lights were checked &#13;
    and all found to be in order. The vessel remained in Warnemünde until 4 or &#13;
    5 October 1994. As a consequence of the ESTONIA accident the bow visor was &#13;
    welded closed, however, broke open again during her subsequent voyage to Turku.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the take-over, &#13;
    Nordström &amp; Thulin instructed Messrs. Turbo Technik of Wilhelmshaven to inspect &#13;
    the bow visor and its locking devices and the following was ascertained:</font> &#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>- Inspection &#13;
        of the hinges by means of the "dye-check" method showed no cracks;<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- &#13;
        the play between the bolt and the lugs of the Atlantic lock was measured &#13;
        to be 35 mm and was different from lug to lug - including bolt / visor &#13;
        lug;<br/>&#13;
        - the prevailing pressure was to forward, thus the play was only aft;<br/>&#13;
        - the lugs were oval as were the bushings;<br/>&#13;
        - the bushing for the spring loaded securing bolt fitted to the bushing &#13;
        between the port and the centre lugs was present;<br/>&#13;
        - the visor lug was oval and fixed to a bar, running diagonally upwards. &#13;
        This was not in conformity with the lug as per drawing No. 48611-373;<br/>&#13;
        - at the centre and port lugs and possibly at the sensor plate there were &#13;
        two angle bars in athwartships direction, from where a pipe was leading &#13;
        to the cross beam of the 3rd stringer level of the visor;<br/>&#13;
        - below this cross beam (round) a double T-beam was fitted, probably to &#13;
        give the visor more transverse strength in the bow wave area (ice);<br/>&#13;
        - the sensors should have been fitted to the 2nd stringer level (mode &#13;
        of operation unclear at present); <br/>&#13;
        - all three lugs of the Atlantic lock had been rewelded to the forepeak &#13;
        deck;<br/>&#13;
        - the lug of the starboard side lock was not original.</font></i></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally attention &#13;
    shall be drawn to one visor damage which occurred outside the Baltic Sea area &#13;
    in the Western Mediterranean sea. It concerns the brand new car/passenger &#13;
    ferry HABIB also classed by B.V. and built for the Tunisian owners Cotunav, &#13;
    Tunis, for service between Tunis-Genua-Marseille by the Nobiskrug Shipyard/Rendsburg &#13;
    in 1978. The vessel has a length of 145.73 m, a breadth of 23.51 m and a draught &#13;
    of 6.16 m. The service speed is 23 kn. The bow ramp was regarded as upper &#13;

    wind: West Bft. 9-10, speed 15.8 kn. From 07.00 hours onwards they were sailing &#13;
    under the French coast. Around 11.00 hours it was noticed that the locking &#13;
    devices of the bow visor had broken and the visor was set to starboard.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was &#13;
    lashed/secured, and the voyage was continued with reduced speed to Marseille.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was &#13;

  "The sections of the final report of the Joint Accident Investigation Commission &#13;
  commented in this contribution are based on a number of individual investigations. &#13;
  Most of these are carried out according to the present state of knowledge and &#13;
  analysis methods. However, the results involve large uncertainties, especially &#13;
  with regard to the loads on the bow visor at the time of the accident. Moreover, &#13;
  the report contains misinterpretations and neglects possible influence factors &#13;
  on the visor failure such as maintenance conditions of the structures in question &#13;
  and pre-existing damage. Summarizing it has to be stated that the parts of the &#13;
  final report commented do not offer a reliable basis for a realistic assessment &#13;
  of the bow visor failure of MV "ESTONIA".</font></p>&#13;

    of the starboard and centre lugs; it has to be assumed, however, that it would &#13;
    have broken if the pulling had been continued as it had been in practice. &#13;
    The bolt was slightly deformed, the visor lug apparently remained unaffected. &#13;

    Bow Impact of Ro-Ro Vessels by Det Norske Veritas</font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This paper - given &#13;
    to the Society of Naval Architects of Japan by Det norske Veritas (DnV) - &#13;
    concentrates on design load aspects for the bow area and presents results &#13;
    of recent work carried out by DnV with the aim of evaluating the long term &#13;
    bow impact loads that a Ro-Ro vessel may be subjected to during its operational &#13;
    life. The reason why it has been incorporated into this report is the obvious &#13;
    fact that the results are partly absolutely contrary to the findings of the &#13;
    JAIC. The paper is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.5.433.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    34.5.433</a> and the conclusions are as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow impact &#13;
      of five different Ro-Ro vessels is studied numerically and empirically. &#13;
      Impact is considered both from an ultimate and a fatigue point of view. &#13;
      For the ultimate load case, the loads are found to be strongly a function &#13;
      of the wave height and the forward vessel speed. this illustrates the importance &#13;
      of speed reductions in rough seas. The study also shows that the highest &#13;
      waves do not necessarily induce the highest impact loads on the structure. &#13;
      The bow impact loads from the DnV Classification Rules are intended to cover &#13;
      all types of designs and design conditions.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A &#13;
      fatigue investigation of the bow door support system for one typical vessel &#13;
      has been carried out. A long term distribution of the bow forces has been &#13;
      established based upon a gradual speed reduction when wave height exceeds &#13;
      significant wave height = 5 meter. The results of the analysis show a fatigue &#13;
      life exceeding 66 years when using the North Atlantic wave climate as basis &#13;
      and <b>constant operation in head seas</b>. This corresponds to 400 years &#13;
      fatigue life for operation in all headings and on this basis it is concluded &#13;
      that fatigue does not represent a problem provided the vessel is operated &#13;
      with good seamanship. These conclusions are based upon the assumption that &#13;
      the bow doors are designed for ultimate loads according to the DnV 1994 &#13;
      Rules and that NV36 strength steel or lower is applied. The welded details &#13;

  Car/Passenger Ferry "Estonia"</i> by Disengage, Axminster/UK</b> </font></p>&#13;
<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All the video tapes &#13;
    available to this 'Group of Experts' showing the ESTONIA afloat and on the &#13;
    bottom of the sea were supplied to Disengage/UK specialised in the evaluation &#13;
    and interpretation of video tapes and the production of video images. The &#13;
    aim of the investigation conducted by Disengage at the beginning was to assist &#13;
    the explosive expert Mr. B. Braidwood in identifying possible explosion damage &#13;
    to the vessel. This has been completed and now the aim has been to identify &#13;
    the technical nature of the videos, provide fully detailed listings of the &#13;
    content of the cassettes, provide still images of any items of possible interest &#13;
    to the overall investigation and identify any anomalies in the content of &#13;
    the cassettes including missing sections of tape and unidentified activity &#13;
    of wreck site. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thirteen cassettes &#13;
    have been submitted to Disengage for analysis. Of these 13 cassettes 4 stem &#13;
    from diver activity and 9 were filmed by remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs). &#13;
    This includes 3 tapes that are duplicates. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are two &#13;
    main differences between videos made by ROVs and videos made by divers.</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ROV videos &#13;
    show data on screen during recording, including date, time, course, depth &#13;
    and camera pitch angle. The ROVs are also generally well lit due to them carrying &#13;
    more than one light to conduct filming.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The diver videos &#13;
    carry no data on screen resulting in dates and times being estimated from &#13;
    brief official documentation and on screen encounters with ROVs from which &#13;
    information is available. The picture quality of the divers videos is also &#13;
    hampered because of the poor lighting used on the head mounted cameras. The &#13;
    single very bright light tends to bleach out the images which effect has been &#13;
    worsened during the duplication process.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation &#13;
    into the cause for the excessive brightness and unclear, foggy pictures revealed &#13;
    that the contractor Rockwater made the original master recordings of the underwater &#13;
    survey on VHS cassettes in a PAL format, however, tests have shown that the &#13;
    copies supplied have been played back and duplicated on PAL/SECAM machines &#13;
    without the necessary converters in place. This has created the breakdown &#13;
    in colour definition, excessive brightness and tracking problems making accurate &#13;
    work with the video tapes very difficult and sometimes impossible. The contractor &#13;
    Rockwater was further requested to explain why so many, and partly long, video &#13;
    pauses had been made respectively long parts of the tapes were just flickering. &#13;
    Their reply was that it is normal practice for cameras to continue recording, &#13;
    for safety and continuity, throughout a survey whether it is conducted by &#13;
    ROVs or divers which is especially relevant when an ROV such as the Sprint &#13;
    unit is used, because it is only image platform with no other capacity than &#13;
    the collection of stills and video. As out of 13 cassettes reviewed only 4 &#13;
    have no cuts (because they were most probably made for demonstration purposes) &#13;
    it is quite obvious that these cuts do not fall into the responsibility of &#13;
    the contractor Rockwater, but were made elsewhere. It has also become apparent &#13;
    that the breaks basically occur in the same areas of the vessel, for example &#13;
    the starboard shell plating in way of the 0-deck below the bridge and funnel. &#13;
    </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another concern &#13;
    regarding the cuts in the footage is the relationship between the on screen &#13;
    timing and the VHS time code. Most of the occasions when a tape cut takes &#13;
    place the elapsed time on the ROV 'on screen clock' is greater than that on &#13;
    the VHS cassettes when most of the cuts in the footage were made at the time &#13;
    of duplication and not when the survey was taking place.</font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary Disengage &#13;
    has made the following main findings:</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the &#13;
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there is evidence that &#13;
    between these dates there has been movement of what would be expected to be &#13;
    stationary items such as ropes and debris. This is most clear on the hawsers &#13;
    to the port side of the bow ramp.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the &#13;
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there are occasions &#13;
    when other activity is taking place on the wreck, visible by other ROV and &#13;
    diver lights on footage. This activity is not covered in the available cassettes.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There are areas &#13;
    on the vessel that have not been surveyed enough to be documented properly. &#13;
    These areas are either missing from the footage due to cuts in the footage &#13;
    or because of a lack of detailed investigation when the ROV or divers are &#13;
    in the area.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This refers in &#13;
    particular to the starboard mudline, bow ramp hydraulic actuators and ramp &#13;
    locking hooks, seabed debris and the car deck in general. On the occasions &#13;
    when the ROV got to the starboard mudline the tape is cut between the funnel &#13;
    and bridge or until the ROV arrives at the starboard rudder or moves to another &#13;
    area on the hull away from the mudline.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bow ramp actuators &#13;
    have both been bent and damaged, however the diver does not attempt to conduct &#13;
    any kind of detailed investigation. Apart from a brief comment about the eye &#13;
    on the end of the starboard actuator on tape B40c/number 19 there is no other &#13;
    comment or video documentation of these important items.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is possible &#13;
    to access the car deck and on tape B40c/number 19 the diver enters it to inspect &#13;
    the ramp securing bolts and mating pockets. On the respective video there &#13;
    is remarkable damage briefly visible which is totally ignored by both the &#13;
    diver and his supervisor and all the many others in the control room on board &#13;
    of SEMI I who were watching what the diver was doing and frequently interfered &#13;
    with instructions.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For example, the &#13;
    diver briefly looked onto a big damage to the port longitudinal car deck bulkhead &#13;
    when he was climbing up the bottom flaps of the bow ramp from starboard to &#13;
    port. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On cassette B40b/number &#13;
    20 the ROV attempts on several occasions to enter the car deck and fails. &#13;
    On several of these occasions the operator believes he has entered the car &#13;
    deck, but then discovers he's wrong and on the seabed. On the final occasion &#13;
    they are sure they have entered and this is very difficult to confirm due &#13;
    to several cuts in the tape, but on the later diver cassette B40e/number 10 &#13;
    from the same date and time the diver sees the ROV on the seabed at the same &#13;
    time as this footage. Due to the large number of cuts on this ROV tape B40b/number &#13;
    20, including one cut of nearly one hour, no conclusions can be made. There &#13;
    is however some confusion in this ROVs activities as during the hour long &#13;
    cut in the ROVs footage the diver sees the ROV active and inside the bow ramp.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the limited &#13;
    footage available from the seabed near the starboard bow of the vessel at &#13;
    a depth of 91 m it is difficult to identify many of the pieces visible, however, &#13;
    some wooden pallets with cement bags on can be seen as well as other debris. &#13;
    This is made worse by the very regular cuts in the footage throughout the &#13;
    time the ROVs are viewing the seabed.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On cassette B40a/number &#13;
    6 dated 4/12/94 the opening dialogue on both the screen and audio commentary &#13;
    states that this is cassette two. Starting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and &#13;
    featuring footage shot by the SPRINT ROV, no cassette has been received labelled &#13;
    as number one or any timed recording before this time on this date.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a large &#13;
    amount of repeat coverage of certain areas of the vessel without any new information, &#13;
    procedure, agenda or evidence being discovered.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On two of the cassettes &#13;
    that have been supplied, the official tape logs that have been supplied as &#13;
    documentation generated at the time of filming do not correspond with the &#13;
    content of the video cassette.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has been confirmed &#13;
    by the contractor used for the diver survey, Rockwater, that it is common &#13;
    practice for divers to be equipped with two different earpieces to allow both &#13;
    the dive supervisor and technical personnel to communicate with the diver. &#13;
    It is apparent on the diver video B40c/ number 19 that the diver is receiving &#13;
    instructions in another earpiece. It is unfortunate that these instructions &#13;
    have apparently resulted in the missing of potentially important areas of &#13;
    the vessel survey. There are no transcripts at all of any of these communications.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is evidence &#13;
    indicating that there has been movement of the bow ramp at some point before &#13;
    it came to rest in its current position. The evidence visible on the tapes &#13;
    is the two hawsers trapped inside the car deck on the port side near the manual &#13;
    side lock. The other evidence is on the starboard side where the visor actuator &#13;
    has caused considerable damage on the front bulkhead, there is a large flap &#13;
    of this metal caught between the ramp and the bulkhead and there is further &#13;
    evidence on the starboard bulkhead recess in way of the blown up fastening &#13;
    of the bow ramp actuator that the ramp had been opened/closed which it had &#13;
    already been resting on the starboard bulkhead.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40c/number &#13;
    19 the divers have cut some items from the bow and are taking them to the &#13;
    crane for lifting, one diver is at the upper port side of the ramp and the &#13;
    other is at the bottom starboard side of the ramp. The diver who is standing &#13;
    on the starboard side bottom of the bow ramp near the hinge turns his head &#13;
    twice towards the seabed. On both occasions another diver is visible on the &#13;
    starboard side of the ramp below him, this diver is wearing different equipment &#13;
    from the two divers already detailed and is not explained in any of the other &#13;
    footage.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the divers &#13;
    are in the area of the port bridge there is a large amount of damage on the &#13;
    under side of the port wing of the bridge which was - at least to some extent &#13;
    - already visible on the ROV video from 02.10.94 and the sheeting appears &#13;
    to be torn off the underside of the bridge wing with heavy scoring marks on &#13;
    the inner side of the vertical stanchion supporting the wing.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The lower outer &#13;
    wire strengthened glass window of the backside of the port bridge wing was &#13;
    also found to be broken trapping what appears to be a victim in the strengthening &#13;
    wire still attached to the window. The diver first pulled the mash wire away &#13;
    and then pulled the body out of the window and let it float away.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40d/number &#13;
    9 the diver says that he is going to the seabed, but there is no tape showing &#13;
    this part of the survey. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the time and &#13;
    date order of the cassettes, tape B40e/number 10 chronologically comes before &#13;
    tape B40d/number 9.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the ROV survey &#13;
    conducted in 1996/number 11 the tape is dated from the official source as &#13;
    19/06/96 but it is cut so badly that it goes back in time by whole days to &#13;
    the 09/06/96, 26/04/96, 17/06/96, 11/06/96 and contains still images from &#13;
    a video pause during duplication.</font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Disengage reached &#13;
    the following conclusions: </font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a disturbing &#13;
    lack of continuity in the cassettes due to the large number of tape cuts. &#13;
    These tape cuts appear to have been made at different times and with different &#13;
    levels of competence. The cuts vary between very clean, single frame cuts &#13;
    with no interference on screen, to long pieces of interference and on several &#13;
    occasions the contents not only change location but go back in time and date. &#13;
    The worst example of this type of cut occurs on the most recent cassette from &#13;
    1996 that jumps back in time nearly two months. Very few of the tape cuts &#13;
    that have been documented in this report occur in locations where victims &#13;
    could be or are located and they are not due to technical issues, leaving &#13;
    no apparent reason for their existence. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The fact that the &#13;
    tape cuts repeatedly occur in the same areas of the vessel on different cassettes &#13;
    from different times and dates does not allow us to generate full documentation &#13;
    of a very serious casualty. This is a particular concern as the areas that &#13;
    lack documentation are very important to the investigation and include the &#13;
    starboard mudline and car deck. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is wide range &#13;
    of diver and ROV activity on and around the wreck site that is not detailed &#13;
    in the available footage. The time comparisons detailed in this report illustrate &#13;
    that the activity of some of the ROVs and divers visible on the tapes is not &#13;
    documented in its own right due to lack of tapes or tape cuts. On several &#13;
    occasions this undocumented activity is in areas where there is a lack of &#13;
    overall documentation, including the car deck and bow ramp.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Format problems &#13;
    resulting in poor duplication and footage quality hamper independent investigation &#13;
    of the official cassettes. The lack of format conversion during duplication &#13;
    has resulted in a large drop in quality, combined with the tape cuts it has &#13;
    meant that reaching conclusions from the tapes and still images has been far &#13;
    more difficult, sometimes impossible. </font></li>&#13;

  by Brian H.L. Braidwood, MBIM, MIExpE, Weymouth/UK</b></font></p>&#13;
<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">At the beginning &#13;
    of this subchapter the Estonian managing director of Estline,</font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> &#13;
    Johannes Juhanson, shall be quoted when he told the Estonian media on 29.09.94:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»"Estonia" &#13;
      was sunk by an abnormal factor, an explosion or an underwater collision.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In February 1999 &#13;
    Brian Braidwood was requested by this 'Group of Experts' to look into certain &#13;
    aspects of the casualty in his capacity as diving and underwater explosives &#13;
    expert, in particular to investigate whether explosive devices were present &#13;
    on board the ESTONIA and had caused damage when they exploded before the sinking &#13;
    of the ferry.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a very &#13;
    careful investigation Brian Braidwood concentrated his attention on three &#13;
    aspects, viz.:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a. The suspect &#13;
      package found during underwater surveys by the port side of the bow ramp.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b. Damage &#13;
      near the visor starboard side locks. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c. Damage &#13;
      on the car deck at the port side forward.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After dealing with &#13;
    each item in turn, he has drawn certain conclusions.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These are:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a.<b> The suspect &#13;
    package</b><br/>&#13;
    It has been considered whether this suspect package could have been an explosive &#13;
    device even if the sides of the cube were no longer than 100 mm - the smallest &#13;
    estimate. A block of this size would indeed have enough space to hold all &#13;
    the essential components of a small explosive charge of one to two kilograms.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finding such &#13;
    a device near the side locks suggests an attempt to damage the ship at a particularly &#13;
    vulnerable position. However, in later video surveys of the same area, the &#13;
    package has disappeared. When or how the device got there must remain a matter &#13;
    of conjecture. It can only be emphasised that the act of placing and arming &#13;
    such a charge takes only a few seconds as the firing time will have been set &#13;
    beforehand. A determined saboteur might well decide to increase his possibility &#13;
    of success by placing more charges, at similar vulnerable points elsewhere &#13;
    on the ship. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood &#13;
    concludes that on a balance of probabilities the suspect package could have &#13;
    been an explosive device containing between one and three kilograms of plastic &#13;
    explosive.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>b. Damage near &#13;
    the visor starboard side locks</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Photos of the &#13;
    visor tank on land, show that on the starboard side, the two metal plates &#13;
    forming the hook for the manual side lock were severely distorted and folded &#13;
    onto an overlapping position. The lug for the hydraulic side lock has been &#13;
    ripped off the visor tearing away a flap of metal. The photos also show distinct &#13;
    darkening of the white paint surface above the badly distorted hook for the &#13;
    manual side lock. This marking looks like burn or scorch marks.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the port &#13;
    side, however, the ends of the two metal plates forming the hook for the manual &#13;
    side lock had only been pressed together. Also, the lug of the hydraulic side &#13;
    lock had been ripped off where its welding has given way, but there was no &#13;
    sign of burn marks anywhere on the port side. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are several &#13;
    black and white photos and one composite picture made up of overlapping video &#13;
    stills. This composite picture gives a dramatically clear impression of the &#13;
    damage to the ship's bulkhead in the area of the side locks. This view of &#13;
    the damaged area was taken from the forward side of the bulkhead looking aft. &#13;
    The bottom half of the picture shows the opening for the manual side-lock &#13;
    hooks. Above that is the hydraulic side-lock lug which was torn off the visor. &#13;
    Above that again is a fresh hole in the metal. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Dealing with &#13;
    the details from the bottom, the picture shows that the extreme lower end &#13;
    of the manual side-lock opening is still in the shape of a smooth curve and &#13;
    so is undamaged. However, within a very short distance, the metal has been &#13;
    splayed out towards the camera. This is easier to see in the actual video.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the top &#13;
    of the opening for the manual side lock, photos show damage to the bulkhead &#13;
    in the immediate vicinity of the visor damage just described. In a colour &#13;
    photo, the opening designed to receive the hook of the manual side lock, has &#13;
    been enlarged by damage at its upper end and some pieces of metal may have &#13;
    been completely displaced from the area. The manual side-lock securing mechanism &#13;
    can been still inside the hole as it was never secured for the final voyage. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic &#13;
    side-lock lug, which was ripped away from the visor, was lodged in its recess &#13;
    on the starboard front bulkhead where it would normally be located when locked. &#13;
    At the edges of the hole the metal seems to have split in all directions away &#13;
    from the centre. this is all characteristic of the sea of an explosion.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Just above &#13;
    this area there is a fresh hole which is made by a flap having been pushed &#13;
    back in an S-shaped fold. It is a fairly round hole about 250 mm across. Some &#13;
    of the metal has been pushed in, (away from the camera position). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A comparison with &#13;
    the port side bulkhead showed no damage at all that might have been compatible &#13;
    with an explosion. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The circumstances &#13;
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, &#13;
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor &#13;
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well &#13;
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through &#13;
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the &#13;
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the &#13;
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from &#13;
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this &#13;
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The marking &#13;
    and damage suggests that if an explosive device was used it would have been &#13;
    placed on the after side of the bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock &#13;
    slot. This means that a device like the one described earlier would have remained &#13;
    in place despite water flowing through the slot just below it. When it exploded, &#13;
    it was probably completely surrounded by water, with the other side of the &#13;
    bulkhead also flooded. This would have resulted in a strong shock wave through &#13;
    the water reaching the nearby visor. However, the presence of water on both &#13;
    sides of the bulkhead would have reduced the area of damage. The chock might &#13;
    well have fractured the welds of the hydraulic side-lock lug, which was retained &#13;
    in the bulkhead by its pin. The welds apparently tore out the triangular strip &#13;
    of metal seen on the photo of the visor. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To sum it up, the &#13;
    following damage has been described and illustrated in the area of the starboard &#13;
    side lock: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and torn &#13;
      metal damaged around the top part of the manual side-lock opening front &#13;
      bulkhead. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of &#13;
      this damaged metal has been pushed forward towards the visor.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Darkening &#13;
      of the visor paintwork at exactly the same level as the damaged metal described.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The hydraulic &#13;
      side-lock hooks just below the burn marks were pushed down and severely &#13;
      distorted in a manner unlikely to have resulted from any mechanical impact.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On a balance of &#13;
    probabilities Brian Braidwood has concluded that: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The damage near &#13;
      the starboard visor side locks was caused by an explosion.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge &#13;
      weight was between one and two kilograms of TNT equivalent.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explosive &#13;
      device was placed on the forward bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock &#13;
      recess.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device &#13;
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the &#13;
      crewman responsible for operating the manual side lock.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>c. Damage to &#13;
    the car deck port side forward<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood &#13;
    investigates damage in the port forward corner of the car deck, to establish &#13;
    if it might have been caused by an explosion. The damage can been seen in &#13;
    a short part of Video B40c which was taken by a diver. From the video it seems &#13;
    that the diver may not even have been aware of this particular damage, or &#13;
    else was told to look away and concentrate on other areas. The damage is only &#13;
    visible when the camera and light, which the diver is wearing on his head, &#13;
    are turned briefly to one side. There is no reference to the hole by either &#13;
    the diver or his supervisor. Nevertheless, the relevant section of the video &#13;
    has been studied in great detail to establish the possible cause of damage. &#13;
    The image is seen most clearly when the video is played in very slow motion, &#13;
    or even frame by frame, using specialist viewing equipment.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The videos &#13;
    and still photos from around the port forward corner of the car deck show &#13;
    a widespread presence of some sort of red or pink material. Some of it is &#13;
    very shiny and reflects the diver's light. The material may be bedding. In &#13;
    an case it seems to have been used to reduce the flow of water from the flooded &#13;
    visor space past the edge of the raised bow ramp and into the car deck. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on estimates &#13;
    from studying the video and still photos, the lower edge of the damage is &#13;
    about 300 mm above the deck level and there is no apparent damage to the deck &#13;
    itself. This suggest that the device may have been lying on something, perhaps &#13;
    bedding, when it exploded. It could, therefore, have been placed in a higher &#13;
    position and become dislodged by some physical impact in the immediate vicinity. &#13;
    The forward edge of the damage is about 300 mm away from the forward edge &#13;
    of the bulkhead.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Inside and &#13;
    around the hole can be seen the red and pink colouring of the bedding. It &#13;
    looks as if some of it was inside the adjacent compartment and can be seen &#13;
    through the damage hole. The damage hole itself is fairly round and about &#13;
    300 mm across.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hole is &#13;
    bordered by petals of split metal which have split in all directions away &#13;
    from the centre of the hole. The photos are taken looking at the bulkhead &#13;
    from inside the car deck space and it can be seen how the petals cast strong &#13;
    shadows onto the bulkhead. This clearly shows that the metal has been pushed &#13;
    away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The circumstances &#13;
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, &#13;
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor &#13;
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well &#13;
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through &#13;
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the &#13;
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the &#13;
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from &#13;
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this &#13;
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the device &#13;
    exploded in the manual side-lock access compartment the space would have been &#13;
    flooded. This means the device would have been surrounded by water with air &#13;
    on the car deck side of the damaged bulkhead. However, from the comparatively &#13;
    small extent of damage, it is unlikely that any device exploded in contact &#13;
    with the bulkhead, and there is no way of knowing how far from the bulkhead &#13;
    it might have been.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the following &#13;
    circumstances were established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - A fairly round &#13;
      damage hole in the port bulkhead of the car deck adjacent to the bow ramp.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and &#13;
      torn metal petals around the edge of the hole.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of &#13;
      the damaged metal pushed away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- That any &#13;
      explosive device used could have been dislodged from a higher position and &#13;
      fallen on some bedding in the compartment next to the car deck.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Any device &#13;
      used would have been surrounded by water when it exploded. These points, &#13;
      taken together, suggest that a small explosion occurred on the far side &#13;
      of the bulkhead with the seat of the explosion being in the centre of the &#13;
      damage hole.<br/></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On a balance of probabilities, &#13;
    Brian Braidwood has concluded that:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The damage in &#13;
      the car deck port side forward was caused by an explosion.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge &#13;

      device was placed inside the space used to give access to the visor side &#13;
      locks.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device &#13;
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the &#13;
      crewman responsible for securing the manual side locks.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The seat &#13;
      of the explosion was just above deck level as if the device had been resting &#13;
      on something, perhaps a pile of blankets, before it went off.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device &#13;
      may be have been placed on the forward bulkhead like the one on the starboard &#13;
      side, and been knocked off to fall onto some bedding before it exploded.</font></p>&#13;

    and hull, the Atlantic lock location between visor and hull and the visor &#13;
    stempost area were examined. The investigations also included a visual examination &#13;
    of the parts cut off the MARE BALTICUM ex DIANA II. The results of the difficult &#13;
    and long lasting examinations, partly carried out at KTH, Stockholm, shall &#13;
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(1) The visor &#13;
    stempost </b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welds between &#13;
    stempost and shell plating of the visor had failed already during normal service &#13;
    by a spectrum of cyclic loading providing tensile stress at the crack initiation &#13;
    points together with long term corrosive action of seawater after opening &#13;
    of the welds. As a consequence the stempost had not only been separated from &#13;
    the shell plating during normal service but the stempost being a vital part &#13;
    in its load-carrying function was in itself found to be split up into four &#13;
    parts by crack development well before the casualty. The drawing on the next &#13;
    page shows the cracks F1 - F4 of which F1 had penetrated the thickness of &#13;
    the stempost to about 40% and blue paint was found inside the crack. It could &#13;
    be verified that these traces of blue paint originated from penetration of &#13;
    the outside paint into the crack opening at the time the crack had penetrated &#13;
    the stempost already to the extent of about 40% of its thickness.</font></p>&#13;

    thus at that time the stempost was already cracked by ca. 40%.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation &#13;
    of fracture F1 - F4 ascertained that all the transverse fracture had started &#13;
    and penetrated from the outside by corrosion assisted fatigue cracking. In &#13;
    addition, fractures F2 and F3 reveal major bending displacements of their &#13;
    flanks, in particular fracture F3 reveals a specific bending angle of about &#13;
    70° combined with severe bending deformation following the original crack &#13;
    development. </font></p>&#13;

    lock</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inspection &#13;
    of the original lug remains recovered from the wreck of the ESTONIA at KTH, &#13;
    Stockholm revealed that the failure of the Atlantic lock took place by rupture &#13;
    of the 3 lugs welded to the forepeak deck of the ferry, viz. at first to their &#13;
    circular welds to the housing/bushing, subsequently in the remaining cross &#13;
    sections by overload shear at about 40° to the mounting plane on forepeak &#13;
    deck, whereby also bending distortion prior to final cracking of the assembly &#13;
    was found.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor mating &#13;
    lug was found to be deformed by bending of about 15°-20° to starboard whereby &#13;
    apparently a crack had opened in the weld between the visor bottom plating &#13;
    and a vertical support stiffener.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bore of &#13;
    this mating lug had an original diameter of 85 mm, however, which was measured &#13;
    to be 91 x 105 mm with an oval deformation towards forward indicating the &#13;
    main force direction to have been aft.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    is a confirmation of the structural analysis of the visor by the FE method &#13;
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.2.430.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    34.2.430</a> - according to which the force direction at the Atlantic lock &#13;
    was found to be <b>aft as long as the visor hinges were intact.</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another downward &#13;
    bending movement of about 8°-10° was found which indicated forward tilting &#13;
    of the visor bottom prior to the failure of the lock.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    is only possible if the hinges had failed already. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further found &#13;
    that the position and shape of the visor's mating lug did not fully comply &#13;
    with the available drawings, thus changes had been made during the life of &#13;
    the vessel. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Further examinations &#13;
    revealed that about 90% of the length of welds between the lugs on the forepeak &#13;
    deck and the bushing/housing had been pre-cracked by fatigue. The crack propagation &#13;
    together with the corrosion showed a similar picture as found on the visor &#13;
    stempost.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary &#13;
    of the above it can be concluded that the welding seams between the lugs on &#13;
    the forepeak deck and the bushing/housing as well as the welding seams between &#13;
    when the visor lug and the visor bottom have been considerable pre-cracked &#13;
    by fatigue.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Deformation &#13;
    indicate a sideways and downwards movement of the visor during final failure &#13;
    of the Atlantic lock.</font></p>&#13;

    locks</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard &#13;
    lug has been torn off the visor bulkhead in such a way that the crack started &#13;
    at the upper edge of the weld between the lug and the visor plating, then &#13;
    propagation in a downward direction, being inclined to starboard by about &#13;
    20° against the vertical, leaving a steel tongue at an angle of more than &#13;
    90° to the bulkhead surface before final separation of the lug from the visor &#13;
    plating.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The port lug &#13;
    location indicates a more vertical down tearing movement during crack propagation &#13;
    without leaving a steel tongue before failure. No detailed investigation of &#13;
    the character of the fractures have been performed nor were the welding seam &#13;
    remains examined.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Actuator &#13;
    mountings on B-deck</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard &#13;
    actuator was torn off from the supporting B-deck structure, whereby the welds &#13;
    failed first and the vertical stiffeners below the B-deck plating subsequently, &#13;
    leaving strongly deformed steel tongues behind. Inspection of the dismounted &#13;
    port actuator revealed a repair weld in way of the vertical stiffener at a &#13;
    location with possible high stress during the opening procedure. Investigation &#13;
    revealed the fatigue cracked area to cover 50-70% of the total load-carrying &#13;
    area of this weld.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(5) Actuator &#13;
    hinges at the visor arms</b><br/>&#13;
    At a distance of 1300 mm forward of the visor's main hinges the actuator hinges &#13;
    (fastening) were fitted underneath the visor arms and permitted the actuators' &#13;
    sideways movements up to an angle of 15°. No specific structural failures &#13;
    could be found by visual inspection. Severe scratch marks were found with &#13;
    complete removal of the paint at an angle of 8-10° against the horizontal. &#13;
    At the linear forward edges of the lug plates deeper surface damage had been &#13;
    caused as compared to the curved aft edges. It can be concluded that these &#13;
    scratch marks are a result of the cutting process of the lug plates through &#13;
    the forecastle deck plating. The scratch mark inclination of 8°-10° against &#13;
    the visor arm would coincide with a forward rotation of the visor around the &#13;
    Atlantic lock while the lug plates were cutting through the deck structure &#13;
    and the side locks had failed already. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(6) The visor &#13;
    hinges</b><br/>&#13;
    The visor's hinge system design consisted of the starboard and port side hinge &#13;
    arms fabricated from structural platings, with two attached lug plates on &#13;
    each side, carrying support bushings with bronze liners in the respective &#13;
    bore holes. The support bushings were welded to the lug plates with circular &#13;
    fillet welds. The visor hinge lugs were mated by deck hinge fittings, represented &#13;
    by lugs welded to the forecastle deck. The mechanical connection was one bolt &#13;
    on each side. The video image below shows the starboard hinge arm shortly &#13;
    be- fore the accident.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The failure of the &#13;
    visor hinges occurred by fractures A1-A8 of the visor lug plates together &#13;
    with the fillet welds to the support bushings. The bolts had been ripped out &#13;
    of the hinges, together with the bushings.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The four visor &#13;
    lug plates revealed various amounts of macroscopic deformation and necking &#13;
    at the fracture locations.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures &#13;
    A1-A4 of the upper locations of the remaining bores were indicating considerable &#13;
    less necking as compared to the lower fractures A5-A8. In particular, the &#13;
    upper fractures A3,A4 of the starboard lugs exhibited only very small fracture &#13;
    edge contractions, yielding substantially identical cross sections of the &#13;
    fractures and the plates as taken from the design drawing. Fracture A4, shows &#13;
    delaminations originating from longitudinally to rolling direction orientated &#13;
    inclusions.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The respective &#13;
    upper fractures of the port side lugs A1, A2 showed visible necking with some &#13;
    reduction of local cross sections. the lower fracture of the outer port side &#13;
    lug A5, was considerable necked representing a typical shear failure.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lower fractures &#13;
    A6 of both the inner port side and the outer starboard lug A8 were heavily &#13;
    deformed by bending and hammering. As a particular feature, the inner starboard &#13;
    upper fracture A3, was accompanied by numerous secondary cracks. Some of them &#13;
    even penetrated the lug plate in radial direction without significant macroscopic &#13;
    deformation.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visual &#13;
    investigation of the failed fillet welds between the hinge lugs and the support &#13;
    bushings revealed different cracking modes at the upper and lower fractures &#13;
    of the hinge plates. Close to the upper hinge lug plate fractures, A1-A4, &#13;
    the fillet welds had failed mostly by cracks parallel to either the hinge &#13;
    or the bushing surface.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cracks &#13;
    propagated also very often below the respective base material surfaces. At &#13;
    the lower fracture areas of the hinge plates A5-A8, the fillet welds seemed &#13;
    to have failed more by a shear fracture of the weld metal, revealing thicknesses &#13;
    between 5 and 7 mm. However, there were also hammering effects on the weld &#13;
    crack surfaces in this area which was more subjected to compression than to &#13;
    tensile stress. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One bushing &#13;
    had been recovered from the wreck while the remaining visor hinge lug plates &#13;
    had been removed from the visor for investigation at the Institut för Hållfasthetslära &#13;
    of KTH, Stockholm. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures &#13;
    and cracks of the upper locations A1-A4 of both the starboard and port side &#13;
    hinge lug plates exhibit ratchet marks and fatigue bench marks which demonstrate &#13;
    the start of fatigue cracking from flame cutting marks in the inner bore of &#13;
    the lugs. This applies also to the lower fracture of the inner starboard lug, &#13;
    A8. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For further &#13;
    identification of the cracking mechanism, a section was removed from the inner &#13;
    starboard upper fracture A3 area containing the above mentioned secondary &#13;
    cracks. As from the metallographic investigation, fig. 46, the cracks developed &#13;
    stepwise and showed side branching with corrosion products being typical for &#13;
    corrosion supported cracking.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The investigation &#13;
    of one of the secondary cracks (A3) revealed numerous smaller secondary cracks &#13;
    also starting from the inner asymmetrically applied deep flame cuts. The formation &#13;
    of respective ratchet marks can be clearly demonstrated at the crack initiation &#13;
    points, which show successive striation marks at various locations of the &#13;
    secondary cracks being created by stepwise crack propagation in radial direction &#13;
    of the visor hinges.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fatigue &#13;
    cracks of the visor hinge plates did however also initiate from the outer &#13;
    surface of the hinge plates. The inner bore holes of the hinge plates were &#13;
    originally drilled by machining, however, the surfaces visible outside of &#13;
    these areas were noted as having been destroyed by inadequate application &#13;
    of flame cutting.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fracture &#13;
    of the recovered hinge bushing was fitting to the fracture of the inner starboard &#13;
    hinge lug. It exhibits a gap of about 4-6 mm between lug bore and support &#13;
    bushing. This gap is almost entirely filled with corrosion products, presumably &#13;
    magnetite, which is also found in thick layers at a location where both hinge &#13;
    late and fillet weld failure are represented together with some excess weld &#13;
    metal, see arrow on the picture below which may have provided a local notch &#13;
    effect.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1197.jpg" width="308" height="244"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In another cross &#13;
    section, also severe corrosion inside the gap is identified and the surface &#13;
    of the hinge bore and the bushing exhibit a considerable misalignment, which, &#13;
    during welding of the left fillet weld, was overcome by a buffering layer. &#13;
    The misalignment corresponds to asymmetric burning marks, for example of the &#13;
    inner starboard hinge.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For closer &#13;
    investigation only a small part of an adhering fillet weld of the support &#13;
    bushing was available. It included both a full crack of the hinge plate material &#13;
    and a secondary crack close to the weld metal and showed also the flame cut &#13;
    surface of the hinge plate bore hole. While the full crack revealed plastic &#13;
    shear at its flanks, the secondary crack had started from the heat affected &#13;
    flame cut surface and propagated close to the heat affected zone of the weld &#13;
    in radial direction. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the &#13;
    evidence provided by the above investigation, the following conclusions can &#13;
    be drawn:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The fillet welds &#13;
      between the hinge plates and the bushings seem to have partially failed &#13;
      a considerable time before the casualty due to corrosion supported fatigue.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The partial &#13;
      failure of these fillet welds provided access of seawater to the gap between &#13;
      the hinge plates and the bushings and caused reduction of load carrying &#13;
      capacity of the hinges. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Both effects &#13;
      facilitated the start and propagation of extensive corrosion fatigue cracking &#13;
      of the hinge plates at another location which occurred also a considerable &#13;
      time before the casualty as demonstrated by the corroded appearance of the &#13;
      fracture of the inner starboard hinge.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It has &#13;
      to be assumed that the inner starboard hinge may have failed first with &#13;
      only a small macroscopic plastic deformation at the edges of the fracture &#13;
      and without leaving bending of the rest of the hinge plate.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As the &#13;
      port inner hinge plate was found to be bent to port and plastic necking &#13;
      at the fracture was noted, it has to be assumed that the port hinges failed &#13;
      after the starboard hinges. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above explained &#13;
    investigation of the various parts of the ESTONIA visor system has provided &#13;
    sufficient evidence that the visor hinges, in particular, the starboard hinge &#13;
    lugs, were severely precracked, before the casualty. There is also evidence &#13;
    that the fillet welds between the visor hinge lugs and the support bushings &#13;
    failed due to corrosion assisted fatigue.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to &#13;
    determine the required strength assessments, a Finite Element Calculation &#13;
    of the stresses in the above welds was carried out which considered four different &#13;
    directions of loads on the hinge lugs and established the location of the &#13;
    maximum fracture inducing radial stresses in the fillet welds for each direction &#13;
    and for various applied loads. The thickness of the fillet welds were taken &#13;
    as 7 mm.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For example, &#13;
    the normal visor opening procedure created a vertical down force of maximum &#13;
    375 kN on each hinge lug based on nominal visor weight and respective leverages &#13;
    and resulted in maximum radial stress in the fillet weld found at the location &#13;
    as marked by the circle in the drawing below together with the stress distribution &#13;
    in radial direction. Accordingly the opening procedure would thus create a &#13;
    local radial weld joint stress of 75 N/mm². </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1199.jpg" width="465" height="352"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is thus obvious &#13;
    that, during opening of the visor, the location of maximum radial fillet weld &#13;
    stress is found in the same region where fatigue cracking of those fillet &#13;
    welds initiated. However, also the other assumed directions of loads on the &#13;
    visor hinges would provide maximum radial stress locations. In particular, &#13;
    a similar stress range as for the opening procedure would result from an assumed &#13;
    aftwards force on the hinges. Such an aftwards load could have created the &#13;
    conditions for crack initiation and failure of the hinge plates, following &#13;
    the failure of the fillet.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the present &#13;
    investigation the following conclusions are drawn: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The ESTONIA bow &#13;
      visor system contained considerable amounts of fatigue cracking which was &#13;
      created by dynamic loads during normal service. The visor hinges showed &#13;
      the largest amount of pre-damage, together with the mountings of the hydraulic &#13;
      actuators.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure &#13;
      of the bow visor hinges was initiated by failure of the fillet welds which &#13;
      were vital supporting joints between the visor hinge plates and the supporting &#13;
      bushings.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure &#13;
      of the hinge fillet welds at locations of high stress was initiated by corrosion &#13;
      fatigue a considerable time before the casualty.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The dynamically &#13;
      loaded hinge plates failed by fatigue cracking and subsequent plastic overloading &#13;
      of the remaining weakened cross sections. The fatigue crack initiation at &#13;
      the hinge plates was favourised by corrosion, reduced load-carrying capacity &#13;
      and burning marks.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In addition &#13;
      to the visor hinges and the actuator mountings, there were various other &#13;
      pre-damaged locations, in particular, the stempost and the bottom lock area, &#13;
      which may have contributed to overloading of the hinge locations. </font></p>&#13;

    of the visor, the handling of the mooring lines by the deck crew and, finally, &#13;
    he zoomed in on the starboard visor hinges. The first copy of the original &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The results are &#13;
    summarised in the<i> Report on the Loss of the Ro-Ro Ferry "Estonia"</i> - &#13;
    attached as Enclosure 12.5.180 and shall be briefly commented as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The object of the &#13;
    report was to detect and identify any structural rupture or damage which could &#13;
    have contributed to the loss of the Ro-Ro ferry ESTONIA. For identification &#13;
    of components bracketed numbers, for example (5) in the text refer to annotations &#13;
    on the drawings, on the previous page. A detailed examination of the video &#13;
    tape showed the only damage to be identified limited to the starboard visor &#13;
    hinge.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inner visor &#13;
    hinge plate (2) is correct and straight on its fore and aft axis other than &#13;
    a section of approximately 150 mm between the vertical centre line of bolt &#13;
    (10) and the aft end of the visor arm (1). This section has a clockwise twist &#13;
    which gives a downward inclination to the visor bolt (10) and the inner steel &#13;
    bushing surrounding it (7). This inclination of the bolt assembly (10) and &#13;
    the steel bushing extends from its inner end to the outer face of the vessel &#13;
    hinge plate (5). The video image does not allow a precise calculation of this &#13;
    angle, but the average of a series of measurements show it to be approximately &#13;
    4 degrees which gives a downward misalignment of the axis at bolt(10) of approximately &#13;
    25 mm at the starboard face of the vessel's outer hinge plate (5). In addition &#13;
    there are two unexplained dark marks on each side of the inner hinge plate &#13;
    (2) opposite each other at the point it joins the bolt assembly (10). These &#13;
    two marks appear to be joined by a thin line extending across this section &#13;
    of the inner Visor Hinge Plate.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An aft section of &#13;
    approximately 400 mm of the outer visor hinge plate (3) together with the &#13;
    outer steel bushing it carries has a significant rotation in an anti clockwise &#13;
    direction on its fore and aft axis. The whole assembly is visibly rotated &#13;
    to such an extent that both its inner and outer ends can be seen on the video &#13;
    image as an ellipse. This is in marked contrast to the inner bushing assembly &#13;
    (7) which is symmetrical to the axis of the bolt (10) as seen in Makers drawings &#13;
    590/1106. There is another disruption to the bolt assembly, i.e. the outer &#13;
    steel bushing (8) is shown on the hinge plate (3) while the video print shows &#13;
    it to be misplaced outwards by approximately 80 mm. The steel bushing (8) &#13;
    extends further than the portion on the inner side of the outer visor arm &#13;
    although it should be identical as seen on Drawing 590/1106. Taking account &#13;
    of all these situations it is apparent that considerable disturbances have &#13;
    taken place in this area. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the video &#13;
    image a significant linear difference is apparent along the axis of bolt (10) &#13;
    at its interfaces with outer steel and bronze bushing at the outer side of &#13;
    the vessel hinge plate (5). In this area the video image shows a significant &#13;
    fact. The base of the outer visor arm casing (1) can be clearly seen at deck &#13;
    level and can also be seen in a gap of approximately 25 mm between the vessel's &#13;
    outer hinge plate (5) and the outer steel bushing (8). According to Makers &#13;
    Drawing this should not be possible, as the bushing (8) should obstruct this &#13;
    view. In addition to this nothing can be seen of the fixed bushing (6) beyond &#13;
    the face of the outer vessel hinge plate (5) from which it should protrude &#13;
    by 5 mm nor can the 5 mm distance ring which should be between the outer hinge &#13;
    plate and the outer steel bushing. There is a further significant fact, approximately &#13;
    150/160 degrees for the bronze and steel bushing (8) is missing from the lower &#13;
    section of the Bolt Assembly (10). From the video image it is clearly visible &#13;
    that the securing plate (9) is totally missing and that the bolt (8) is not &#13;
    in place where it should be, and that only 2 of the 4 securing plate bolts &#13;
    (11) are in position and are sticking out of the outer steel bushing (8). &#13;
    These are either studs from which the nuts have been forced off or bolts nuts &#13;
    with the heads broken off.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary the following &#13;
    has to be concluded:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This Report is based &#13;
    on Video Tape Images showing disruption to the structure of the Ferry "Estonia", &#13;
    especially in the area of the Starboard Hinge Plates (2) and (3), and on the &#13;
    Bolt Axis (10). This damage is very significant, especially so when the components &#13;
    involved form part of a load bearing assembly liable to operate in heavy sea &#13;
    conditions. </font></p>&#13;

    Structure Analysis of the Bow Ramp Hinges<br/>&#13;
    by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has stated &#13;
    on page 175 of their Final Report:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»After the &#13;
      ramp had been forced open by the visor, waves may have caused the ramp to &#13;
      move between fully open and partly closed position, but generally a significant &#13;
      opening was available for waves to enter the car deck as further described &#13;
      in 13.5 below. The large amounts of water flooding onto the car deck caused &#13;
      the vessel to heel over and after a few rolling movements a significant &#13;
      list developed to starboard. This happened within the first minutes after &#13;
      the visor had separated from the ship. It is, however, the opinion of the &#13;
      Commission that full service speed setting was maintained right up to the &#13;
      time when the list developed.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that &#13;
    according to the JAIC the bow ramp had been fully open for some time when &#13;
    the vessel was still on full service speed at a significant wave height of &#13;
    between 3.5 - 4.5 m, which included the 7 m wave, from about 30° on the port &#13;
    bow. <br/>&#13;
    Therefore the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg was requested to calculate &#13;
    the water column necessary to break all four intact hinges of the bow ramp. &#13;
    The result was that <b>a static load corresponding to 6 m water </b>- but &#13;
    without the influence of about 14 kn speed - would break all four sound hinges<b>. &#13;
    As the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle already at around midnight, &#13;
    it can be excluded that the bow ramp would have remained connected to the &#13;
    vessel by the hinges</b> in particular if the vessel was making a speed of &#13;
    about 14 kn against bow seas.<br/>&#13;
    As explained in the previous Subchapters 6.5, 12.4 and 12.5, however, the &#13;
    severely pre-damaged <b>port outer hinge </b>of the bow ramp<b> had collapsed &#13;
    </b>presumably already in March 1994 and the ramp became detached from the &#13;
    vessel and most probably subsequently <b>also the port inner hinge</b> broke, &#13;
    leaving the <b>starboard inner and outer hinges.<br/></b>Calculations of the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg have revealed &#13;
    that in case the ramp was just connected to the vessel by the port inner, &#13;
    the starboard inner and the starboard outer hinges a <b>static load of 4 m &#13;
    water</b> would have been sufficient to break off the ramp not taking into &#13;
    account <b>the additional effect of a speed of 14 kn,</b> and if the ramp &#13;
    <b>had been connected just by the starboard inner and outer hinges</b> - which &#13;
    was the most likely scenario - a static load of only 2.5 m is required to &#13;
    break off the ramp, again, not considering the effect of the speed.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As it has been &#13;
    proved with certainty - Subchapter 12.4 - that the port outer bow ramp hinge &#13;
    was broken and the ramp detached from the vessel many months before the casualty, &#13;
    which was confirmed by the damage picture of the ramp after the casualty, &#13;
    it can be concluded that the bow ramp would have broken off completely had &#13;
    it been fully open shipping water with a significant wave height of between &#13;
    3.5 - 4.5 m (7 m) on the port bow and with the vessel making a speed of about &#13;
    14 kn. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The respective &#13;

    that it has theoretically been possible for the lugs underneath the visor &#13;
    arms to break through the deckbeam at frame 159. It has not been the subject &#13;

        'Estonia' is apparently resting on her side at 70 m depth. The vessel &#13;
        was already located 2 hours after the survey vessel 'SUUNTA' commenced &#13;
        her search on Friday (1.10). A ROV can be sent down at the earliest on &#13;
        Saturday (2.10). ... <br/>&#13;
        The master of the F.B.N. survey vessel 'SUUNTA' refuses to analyse the &#13;
        sonar pictures of the wreck. ... <br/>&#13;
        The wreck was found pretty close to the casualty area. <br/>&#13;
        As soon as the wreck has been video-filmed, the commission shall meet &#13;
        in Helsinki to analyse the films. According to Kari Lethola the video &#13;
        films will not be shown to the public until the commission has completed &#13;
        its analysis carefully and quietly. <br/>&#13;
        Lethola does not make definite statements, however admits that a lot indicates &#13;
        the visor to have been the cause of the casualty. "We have a lot of indications &#13;
        pointing to this but no evidence. This we will only get after the wreck &#13;

        The commission has finalized the taking of statements from the survivors. &#13;
        On Friday they concentrated on collecting all thinkable information which &#13;
        might have a relation to the casualty. There is eyewitness evidence drawing &#13;
        the investigators' attention to the bow door. However Lethola does not &#13;
        exclude completely the possibility that the cargo might have shifted. &#13;
        "The many reports about banging noises from the car deck could indicate &#13;
        that the cargo did move", Lethola replied. <br/>&#13;
        The Swedish and Estonian parts of the commission have gone home and the &#13;
        commission shall first collect everything concrete to work with. <br/>&#13;
        "Now our work aims at filming the wreck. With the help of the video films &#13;

        In Finnish newspapers it was reported on Saturday (01.10.94) that 'Estonia' &#13;
        may have had problems already one hour before finally the alarm was transmitted. &#13;

        "normal" route for the 'Estonia'. <br/>&#13;

        Everything points to the visor located in front of the bow ramp to the &#13;
        car deck to have been the cause for the casualty. Dr. Jouko Nuorteva, &#13;
        who analysed the sonar pictures taken when 'Estonia' was located, could &#13;
        give them on Sunday a new interpreta-tion. According to Nuorteva the vessel &#13;
        is turned towards East, i.e. not in the course direction as it was believed &#13;
        in the beginning. <b>At the bow there is a large object which was either &#13;
        torn loose or is hanging on the bow</b>. The object could according to &#13;
        Nuorteva be the damaged visor or part of the visor. The video pictures &#13;
        shall deliver the information in case the visor should have sustained &#13;
        such a big damage. The investigators now have access to as many video &#13;
        films as still pictures from 'Estonia'. The pictures were taken in black/white &#13;
        and colour. <br/><b>"The pictures are of a high quality, so much we can say,</b>" said &#13;

        Estonia's President, Lennart Meri, is fully prepared to exchange the Estonian &#13;
        Transport Minister Andi Meister, who is jeopardized by Sweden and Finland &#13;
        in the joint investigation of the 'Estonia' casualty. <b>There must not &#13;
        remain the slightest doubt that Estonia wants complete certainty about &#13;
        the catastrophe.</b>"<br/>&#13;
        This was stated by the President in an interview last Sunday in Stockholm &#13;
        ... <br/>&#13;
        The 65 year old President has taken it very personally that there was &#13;
        so much mistrust against the Estonian crew and the Estonian JAIC members &#13;
        expressed recently by several Finnish and Swedish civil servants. <br/>&#13;
        He listened politely to the questions, nodded but did not want to become &#13;
        polemical about them. He said slowly, very slowly and with very much self-control &#13;
        after having pointed to all the flags outside the hotel being put on half-mast: &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        "There was the best trained personnel one can think of on the 'Estonia'. &#13;
        They did their work exemplarily and did everything to avoid that panic &#13;
        broke out. Captain Arvo Andresson, this experienced sailor, stood all &#13;
        the time on his bridge and never left it. He followed the vessel also &#13;
        into the depth. Everything went so fast."<br/>&#13;
        The last days had added doubts about the Estonian Transport Minister Andi &#13;
        Meister as chairman of the JAIC. Among other things the Swedish sea safety &#13;
        experts questioned his competence. <br/>&#13;
        "In this context I can only say that in case there should be indications &#13;
        of a conflict of interest for any Estonian person, we shall exchange him", &#13;
        Lennart Meri replied.<br/><b>Confidence</b><br/>&#13;
        He pointed out spontaneously that he himself had appointed a personal &#13;
        representative (for the JAIC), who, with his 40 years in the sailor profession, &#13;
        stood for competence and experience. He has the President's full confidence &#13;
        and he is member of the JAIC.<br/><b>Note:</b> He means Uno Laur. <br/>&#13;
        The President explained that two Estonian representatives had already &#13;
        left the JAIC and were replaced. He added that they had wished to leave &#13;

        By Jim Muluran, Shipping Editor<br/>&#13;
        Sonar images of the wreck of the 'Estonia' last night suggested the ferry &#13;
        may have sustained catastrophic damage to her bow doors. Pictures transmitted &#13;
        to the Finnish government vessel "HALLI" from an unmanned submersible &#13;
        suggested the visor bow door was lying 15 m from the hull. The underwater &#13;
        survey tended to confirm fears that the failure of the outer visor may &#13;
        have caused the casualty. There was still no indication as to whether &#13;
        there had also been a devastating failure of the inner watertight doors." &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Turku on &#13;
      this and the following day and viewed the video material produced by the &#13;
      ROVs from the "HALLI". It has to be assumed that it was then decided that &#13;
      the visor had to be considered "not yet found", although somebody must have &#13;
      told Lloyd's List before that the visor had been found. The reasons for &#13;
      such a tactical manoeuvre are obvious: The visor next to the wreck implies &#13;
      a longer sequence of events and rules out a rapid development undetected &#13;
      by the crew until it was too late. The visor close to the wreck also rules &#13;
      out the possibility that the visor might have pulled open the bow ramp when &#13;
      the vessel was still at full speed or, at least, making headway. </font></p>&#13;

      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Film Pictures &#13;
        Show the Visor to Have Been Torn Off </b><br/>&#13;
        Video pictures show that the whole visor was torn off 'Estonia' ... and &#13;
        that the watertight ramp at its inside was about 1 m open. Therefore the &#13;
        car deck became quickly water-filled and the vessel capsized. .... The &#13;
        experts cannot say whether a heavy wave or fatigue of the material have &#13;
        caused the catastrophe. The video pictures demon-strate without doubt &#13;
        that is possible on a modern ferry that the whole visor weighing many &#13;
        tons can simply be torn off. This could be the explanation for the 2 bangs &#13;
        many survivors have heard. ...<br/>&#13;
        The visor was pushed upwards with such force that it broke loose from &#13;
        its hydraulic locking devices and left big holes in the steel plates. &#13;
        ... <br/>&#13;
        The visor has still not been found although ROVs have been used in addition. &#13;
        The reason for this is certainly that the visor fell off more than on &#13;
        hour before the vessel sank. The bow ramp is in position but its locking &#13;
        devices are also damaged. The bow ramp has to ascertain/maintain watertightness &#13;
        even if the visor is damaged, however, it is about 1 m open. The JAIC &#13;
        draws the conclusion that the water quantities which ingressed through &#13;
        the open ramp were sufficient for the vessel to loose the stability and &#13;
        to capsize. <br/>&#13;
        Why the visor was torn off and why also the locking devices of the bow &#13;
        ramp are damaged the JAIC cannot say for the time being. "We need time &#13;
        for us to find the answers why the visor became loose", said Olof Forssberg. &#13;
        According to Forssberg this could be for example a heavy wave, too high &#13;
        speed under the prevailing conditions and too high load.<br/>&#13;
        The JAIC members warned not to draw conclusions with regard to other car/passenger &#13;
        ferries. They would now investigate whether the 'Estonia's' construction &#13;
        would deviate from the construction of other comparable ferries. According &#13;
        to naval architect Börje Stenström, JAIC member, it is already clear that &#13;
        the ferry traffic shall have to face serious consequences even if the &#13;
        answer to the question what caused the casualty should not be found. <br/>&#13;
        "It has to be emphasized that the Atlantic lock of the 'Estonia', which &#13;
        is an additional locking device for heavy weather, had been engaged," &#13;
        said Stenström. <br/>&#13;
        Failure of Material Far-fetched <br/>&#13;
        Stenström does not want to speculate completely about the causes why the &#13;
        lock mechanism failed, however, he stated that failure of the material &#13;
        seemed to be far-fetched. "Then you may rather imagine overload." <br/>&#13;
        Technology Doctor T. Karppinen ... stated that the sea state had influenced &#13;
        the tearing off of the visor. According to Karppinen the pictures of the &#13;
        open bow ramp did support the reports of two engineers that water ingressed &#13;
        through the bow ramp. That they had seen on a monitor."</i></font></p>&#13;

        A Norwegian special-purpose vessel for deep sea photography can be engaged &#13;
        for the examination of "Estonia". <br/>&#13;
        The vessel's name is "Seaway Commander" and it is equipped with 3 remote-controlled &#13;
        mini subs. It is one of the most modern vessels of this type in Northern &#13;
        waters. <br/>&#13;
        The vessel arrived Monday p.m. in Nynåshamn after having left Haugesund &#13;
        on Friday. <br/>&#13;
        "It speaks a lot for the vessel to proceed to Hangö during the night", &#13;
        said Leif Aspen, operations manager of the Norwegian offshore company &#13;

        According to Aspen they are in negotiations right now with the Finnish &#13;
        Coast Guard and the JAIC to obtain the order to examine "Estonia". <br/>&#13;
        The 3 mini subs differ in dimension. The two bigger ones weigh ca. 4500 &#13;
        kg each and the small one just 200 kg. <br/>&#13;
        "The two big ones are equipped with cameras and manipulators, these are &#13;

        Supports Video Film </b><br/>&#13;
        Six days after the catastrophe the only surviving officer having been &#13;
        on duty spoke at a press conference in Tallinn. The 3rd engineer and watch-keeper &#13;
        Margus Treu was in the engine room of the vessel at the time of the casualty. &#13;
        In the case that his evidence is true it is once and forever established &#13;
        that "Estonia's" sinking was caused by the tearing loose of the bow visor. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        In spite of Treu being an experienced sailor it was difficult for him &#13;
        to explain what actually happened. <br/>&#13;
        - "At 01.00 hrs. I saw on my monitor in the engine room that an AB sailor &#13;
        went his control round and that he was just forward at the bow ramp." &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        This information, however, does not conform with the statement that AB &#13;
        sailor Silver Linde made during earlier interrogation by the Commission. &#13;
        Linde testified there that he had completed his round already at 00.30 &#13;
        hrs. by turning a control key behind the bow ramp. <br/><b>Heard Hard Bangs</b> <br/>&#13;
        Between 01.12 and 01.15 Margus Treu heard 2 to 3 strong bangs in the vessel. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        "These were not the waves. They did not sound like from waves even if &#13;
        the waves are very strong. I thought that trucks had started to move and &#13;
        crashed against the shell plating." <br/>&#13;
        He switched his monitor to the effect that he could see the truck. Thereafter &#13;
        he changed the camera and had a look at the bow area. "There I saw that &#13;
        water rushed onto the car deck. Then the vessel had already taken a list. &#13;
        Simultaneously the mate called from the bridge asking: "Can we restore &#13;
        the balance of the vessel again?" Treu tried to pump water over to the &#13;
        other side which failed. The mate asked again: <br/>&#13;
        "Is it possible to pump out freshwater to regain the balance?" Treu replied: &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        "This is not possible, this is technically impossible." <br/><b>The Engines Were Running </b><br/>&#13;
        He also denied information that the engines had stopped long before the &#13;
        vessel sank. No water entered the engine room as long as he was there.<br/>&#13;
        "At 01.25 hrs. I tried to start the port one but it failed. The starboard &#13;
        engines kept running for some minutes more. Then they also stopped." <br/><b>Washed into the Sea</b><br/>&#13;
        Thereafter he crept up to the 8th deck and pulled himself to the aft just &#13;
        when the sinking was interrupted.<br/>&#13;
        - "Then I was washed into the sea by a giant wave. I succeeded in pulling &#13;
        myself up into a lifeboat."<br/>&#13;
        From there he saw that the bow visor had disappeared when "Estonia" disappeared &#13;
        into the deep. <br/><b>After the press conference Margus Treu criticised the interrogations &#13;
        by the Estonian police. The Estonians went very far with their ambitions &#13;
        to clarify the causes for the casualty.</b><br/>&#13;
        On Friday (30 September, i.e. 2 days after the casualty) all passenger &#13;
        lists and Estline's complete documentation concerning "Estonia" were confiscated &#13;
        by the Estonian Security Police. <br/>&#13;
        Note: On 5 October N&amp;T declared the withdrawal from the Stockholm-Tallinn &#13;
        ferry service (which remained a decla-ration only for the years to come &#13;
        because they continued until 1998). On Monday, 03.10., also Sten-Christer &#13;
        Forsberg, technical director of N&amp;T, went very far when he strongly attacked &#13;
        the Swedish Ship Engineers' Association: <br/>&#13;
        - "Their categorical allegations against the Estonian engine room crew &#13;

        problem with the bow visor already before departure from Tallinn harbour. &#13;
        Such a theory can be found in the investigation material of the Tallinn &#13;
        police according to the experience of SvD made in Tallinn.</i></b><i> &#13;
        However according to mate Einar Kukk, who was trainee onboard the 'Estonia', &#13;
        those in command on the bridge did not receive any information that this &#13;
        should have been the case. Kukk was on the bridge between 20.20 hrs. and &#13;
        00.40 hrs. local time. "During this time a possible failure of the visor &#13;
        was not discussed", said Einar Kukk to SvD. The Tallinn police have interrogated &#13;
        58 survivors, of whom 33 are crew members. Many of them state that they &#13;
        heard a distinct metallic noise before 'Estonia' got the list. "But none &#13;
        of them took the view that this resulted from a collision", said the investigator &#13;
        Väino Karmi. The investigation by the police, which runs parallel with &#13;
        the investigations by the International Commission and the Swedish police, &#13;
        indicates that the theory about sabotage can be probably written off. &#13;
        "No such information did come up", said V. Karmi. He is upset about accusations &#13;
        that the Estonian security police did try to hide important witnesses. &#13;
        "When the survivors of the catastrophe arrived at Tallinn Airport we guided &#13;
        them away from the intensive shadowing by the media. Even you journalists &#13;
        have to understand that people having just escaped a tragedy should not &#13;
        be exposed to questions." <br/><b>Fraud with Cargo Weights </b><br/>&#13;
        Väino Karmi is well acquainted with MV 'Estonia' since the Tallinn police &#13;
        initiated an investigation into fraud with cargo weights earlier this &#13;
        year. The trigger off factor was the smuggling of 64 Kurds who were hidden &#13;
        in a Swedish truck. Karmi is of the opinion that many freight forwarders &#13;
        systematically stated lower values to avoid high customs fees. "Each time &#13;
        the Estonian customs made spot checks they found wrong declarations." &#13;
        SvD did scrutinise the "Estonia's" cargo manifest. The 39 trucks contained &#13;
        everything from furniture and timber to frozen fish and fashion clothes. &#13;
        Two trucks were declared empty, but the Tallinn police has no confirmation &#13;
        of some rumours that refugees should have been onboard. <br/><b>Note:</b> There were actually 40 trucks onboard. <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">See &#13;
        Chapter 17</a>. <br/><b>Trainee Mate </b><br/>&#13;
        Mate Einar Kukk was onboard the 'Estonia' to gain practical experience &#13;
        before taking up his normal duty as 2nd mate on "Estonia's" sister vessel &#13;
        'Vironia,' the previous 'Diana II'. 'Vironia' shall take up the traffic &#13;
        at the beginning of November. Kukk reports about the last hours onboard: &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        - "I left the bridge at 00.40 hrs. Then everything was under control. &#13;
        I went to bed just before 01.00 hrs. After ca. 5 minutes I heard a strange &#13;
        noise which I had never heard before at sea." <br/>&#13;
        Kukk went up to see what happened. When he was still in his cabin the &#13;
        vessel started to heel over seriously. Kukk's statements also indicates &#13;
        that 'Estonia' took a list already 30-35 minutes before the casualty. &#13;

        Criticised by the JAIC "</i></b><i><br/>&#13;
        After the visor broke off the 'Estonia' was doomed if the vessel was not &#13;
        turned rather quickly which was not done." That's the way Tuomo Karppinen &#13;
        expressed himself. The JAIC came out with a preliminary report about what &#13;
        caused the casualty after their meeting in Turku on Tuesday. <br/>&#13;
        According to the JAIC the casualty one week ago had been caused by water &#13;
        on the car deck which ingressed via the forward ramp. Why the visor broke &#13;
        loose is not explained. The JAIC declared that it could have been caused &#13;
        by fatigue as well as by one single overload of the locking devices. Thereafter &#13;
        the visor broke off and the inner bow ramp was exposed to such wave loads &#13;
        that the locking devices gradually gave way and the ramp opened some meters. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        This had been sufficient to take in so much water on to the car deck that &#13;
        the vessel became unstable, heeled to starboard and capsized. How fast &#13;
        this developed after the visor broke off the JAIC is unable to say.<br/><b>One A4 Page</b><br/>&#13;
        It is also unknown "which information about the immediate danger did exist &#13;
        on the bridge", as they expressed themselves. One A4 page with short factual &#13;
        comments is all that the JAIC has achieved so far in the investigation &#13;
        of the human tragedy without comparison in Europe after the war. <br/>&#13;
        Many of the experts and members of the JAIC to whom DN spoke did agree &#13;
        in one matter: It is considered to be more or less impossible that ferry &#13;
        proceeded on against the prevailing sea conditions with the 15000 ts heavy &#13;
        ferry without noting that the visor and also parts of the foreship were &#13;
        torn/broken off. <br/>&#13;
        "They should have seen from the bridge that the visor had disappeared", &#13;
        said T. Karppinen. <br/>&#13;
        "It is for me not understandable that one can proceed against 8-10 m high &#13;
        waves without noting that the visor has disappeared", said Sten Anderson &#13;
        who has sailed as master for 17 years and is now observer for Sjöfartsverket &#13;
        to the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
        "It is very difficult to understand that they proceeded on without visor &#13;
        for another hour", said Börje Stenström. <br/>&#13;
        All these comments mean subliminally that those in charge on the bridge &#13;
        after midnight were not competent. Another possibility is that the visor &#13;
        was torn off and the inner ramp damaged by one single wave which did not &#13;
        give the watch officer time to react. <br/><b>Different Versions</b><br/>&#13;
        The statements from the surviving crew members, however, do not confirm &#13;
        the above version of a development within seconds after which the vessel &#13;
        was doomed to capsize. The JAIC's hearing of the crew did clearly reveal &#13;
        that the watch A.B. Silver Linde made his last watch round at 23.30 hours &#13;
        Swedish time. At this time he had turned a key which confirms that he &#13;
        did make his round. Then he heard a loud bang from the ramp and had to &#13;
        hold himself fast not to be knocked off his feet on the car deck. He did &#13;
        nevertheless not draw the conclusion that something dangerous had occurred &#13;
        as the vessel continued to pitch in the heavy seas. Exactly this indicates &#13;
        that what Linde heard was a part of the casualty scenario: He was used &#13;
        from many times before to holding himself against the vessel's move-ments &#13;
        and would not have paid attention unless something special occurred. <br/><b>"Everything normal". </b><br/>&#13;
        When he came to the bridge half an hour later there were the 2nd and the &#13;
        4th mate. At the same time also Captain Arvo Andresson appeared. According &#13;
        to Linde everything was normal on the bridge. Thereafter the phone rang &#13;
        and somebody advised that there was something wrong down in the vessel. &#13;
        Apparently now large quantities of water were penetrating. <br/>&#13;
        Only 24 minutes after Linde and the master came up to the bridge the emergency &#13;
        call "Mayday" was sent. About 20 minutes later the vessel disappeared &#13;
        from the radar screen of "Mariella". If the heavy bang heard by Silver &#13;
        Linde on the car deck at 23.30 hrs. had been caused by the breaking off &#13;
        of the visor, the vessel must have proceeded on for at least half an hour &#13;
        without bow visor and also without those on the bridge noting what had &#13;
        happened. Ab-solutely clear is that the master really tried to save his &#13;
        vessel after he understood what had happened, it is however unclear when &#13;
        this was. <br/>&#13;
        - The pictures from the wreck show that the rudders are almost on hard &#13;
        astarboard and the propellers are in a position indicating that the speed &#13;
        had been reduced, said Tuomo Karppinen. It is, however, unclear when this &#13;
        manoeuvre was made and how long the speed had been reduced. Sten Andersson &#13;
        pointed to the fact that the reducing of speed in the prevailing wind &#13;
        and sea conditions was the only professional way to handle the vessel. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        - However none of the surviving crew members from the engine room talk &#13;
        about speed reduction for any longer period of time. It is extremely important &#13;
        to adjust the speed, this is of particular importance for a vessel with &#13;
        bow visor. According to Sten Andersson the crew "did not judge the circum-stances &#13;
        properly" during that night. Karl-Johan Hagman drew attention to the fact &#13;
        that Estonian vessels with 'Estonia's' engine power are unusual.<br/>&#13;
        - The crew probably did not realize how dangerous it is to proceed with &#13;
        full output of 24000 hp against the heavy waves, an output that was needed &#13;
        to break half meter thick ice. <br/>&#13;
        If the visor should be found near the wreck everything points to a very &#13;
        quick development. The visor then broke loose shortly before the vessel &#13;
        took such a list that all 4 main engines stopped due to lack of oil pressure. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        If, however, the visor should be found a longer distance away from the &#13;
        wreck, this would indicate that the vessel proceeded for some time against &#13;
        the heavy waves without visor. The competence of the crew has to be questioned. &#13;
        Then the JAIC's chairman, the <b>Estonian Andi Meister</b>, does not believe &#13;
        anything of this at all:<br/><b>- According to my opinion the catastrophe was caused by a material &#13;
        failure. "I cannot blame the crew".</b><br/></i><b>Note:</b> When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe on 01.05.97 Andi &#13;
        Meister stated among other things that "the JAIC had decided to use this &#13;
        casualty to set an example by teach-ing the shipbuilding industry a lesson." &#13;
        This required a casualty scenario permitting a cause consideration pointing &#13;
        to the shipbuilder, i.e. the building yard - Meyer Werft in Papenburg. &#13;

        the forward ramp. <br/>&#13;
        3. It was established that the bow visor was lost at a certain time. The &#13;
        bottom lock has been identified by ROV. The lock turned out to be broken. &#13;
        It could not be established however whether the failure had been caused &#13;
        by fatigue or overload.<br/>&#13;
        4. After the visor had fallen off, the inner ramp was exposed to the pressure &#13;
        devices of the ramp to fail in steps and the ramp did open to some extent. &#13;
        Thereby water could penetrate the car deck. It could not be verified whether &#13;
        the locks of the ramp were out of function, i.e. were damaged or whether &#13;
        the ramp moved forward out of a locked position. It has not been possible &#13;
        to clarify whether the damages to the hull in consequence of the tearing &#13;
        off of the visor did cause further leakages. <br/><b>Note</b>: Item 3b of the Smit Tak report after the diving survey in &#13;
        December 1994 reads: "b. Construction damage. Except for some minor buckles &#13;

        ramp some broken windows/ port-holes including the cuts made by the divers &#13;
        during the internal inspection, there is no constructional damage to the &#13;

        is unsupported by evidence, leave alone that the mudline video shows holes, &#13;

        6. It has not been established whether faults of the hydraulic of the &#13;

        The highest police management is disappointed that no better assistance &#13;

        police did not get in contact with us up till now. The Finnish police, &#13;
        however, have been much more active, said Priit Männik. The information &#13;
        he is lacking deals among other things with the passengers who had been &#13;

        technical equipment and with information from the Swedish Shipping Inspection &#13;
        (Sjöfartsverket). <br/>&#13;
        - We have no access to the Swedish inspection made before the last departure &#13;
        here in Tallinn on 27 September in connection with the training of Estonian &#13;
        inspectors, he said. Transport Minister Andi Meister, chairman of the &#13;
        JAIC, criticised for not having allowed the first hearing of survivors &#13;
        to be performed the way required, said on Wednesday that the Estonians &#13;
        had still not been informed who is in Swedish hospitals although many &#13;
        days have passed since the 'Estonia' casualty. <br/><b>Invitation to the Swedish Police</b><br/>&#13;
        Police chief Männik would like the Swedish police to come to Tallinn and &#13;
        participate in the investigation. He and his investigators have now taken &#13;
        the statements of all 61 Estonian survivors. On Wednes-day they commenced &#13;
        analysing the statements. They are working in accordance with 3 main theories &#13;
        why 'Estonia' could have sank, but Priit Männik is like a clam if he is &#13;
        asked questions in this regard.<br/>&#13;

        results are clear. The technical aspects have to be carefully considered &#13;
        in our investigation. Estonia has so far not put forward any suspicion &#13;
        for a criminal offence. <br/>&#13;
        - According to Männik the witness statements from the surviving Estonians &#13;
        are very contradictory. One of the problems is to find the time when what &#13;
        happened.<br/>&#13;
        - He sighs about the confusion which continues to exist about who had &#13;

        wide ranging area with a very thick layer of mud. ...<br/><b>Object Squeezed into Ramp Opening</b><br/>&#13;
        Films from the wreck show some sort of red material near the open bow &#13;
        ramp through which water ingressed to the car deck. The object looks like &#13;
        a mattress. "This is a mattress which you see on the pictures", said Kari &#13;
        Lethola.<br/>&#13;
        "We have discussed this and came to the conclusion that something is jammed &#13;
        in at the bow ramp. This detail has to be filmed again."<br/>&#13;
        "We have studied the drawings and there is a bed-clothing store located &#13;
        right inside the bow ramp." Kari Lethola does not dare to say whether &#13;
        somebody has tried to seal the gap between ramp and bulkhead by means &#13;
        of mattresses or if the mattresses visible on the video film could have &#13;
        floated up and got squeezed in after the vessel sank." </i></font></p>&#13;

      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Damage to Visor &#13;
        Locks is the Main Question </b><br/>&#13;
        The JAIC is now focusing on the question whether the locking device systems &#13;
        holding visor and bow ramp in place were faulty or damaged.<br/>&#13;
        "This is one of the main questions we are concentrating upon", said Uno &#13;
        Laur. As soon as the weather permits the 'Suunta' shall send the ROV's &#13;
        down again, this time for a special documentation of the locking devices. &#13;
        The combination of the broken off visor and the open ramp confuse the &#13;
        experts, simultaneously it does point to the locking systems being a weak &#13;
        point in the sequence-of-events. <br/>&#13;
        "The visor broke off completely or in parts which could have been caused &#13;
        by damaged locks. Thereafter huge water quantities were smashing against &#13;
        the bow ramp, the inner door. This has to be watertight and has strong &#13;
        hydraulic locks.<br/>&#13;
        According to Johannes Palmgren, expert in Shipinspec., the ramp should &#13;
        withstand the waves, even if the visor should be gone - at least for the &#13;
        time it takes the crew to realize that the visor has disappeared.<br/>&#13;
        The videos from the sea bottom show that the ramp is about 1 m wide open &#13;
        at the upper side. The gap continues at both sides and narrows continuously. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        "Nowhere do you find an answer to the question why different locking systems &#13;
        failed almost simultaneously", said Uno Laur. On Thursday the experts &#13;
        of the Estonian part of the JAIC com-menced looking at the 16 hours of &#13;
        video film available. SvD received permission to join the marine experts &#13;
        while viewing the videos. <br/><b>Sharp pictures.</b><br/>&#13;
        Remarkably sharp pictures from 'Estonia's' propeller triggered off an &#13;
        intensive discussion. The question what speed was she making on her way &#13;
        to disaster is most relevant. The 15 kn which were the rule in heavy weather &#13;
        could have been too much. Nevertheless, what happened after the crew discovered &#13;
        free floating water on the car deck? <br/>&#13;
        Was the speed reduced to minimize the water ingress or did it come too &#13;
        late? <br/>&#13;
        "There are relations between the angles of the propeller blades which &#13;
        indicate the speed of 'Estonia' just before she sank. On the film a rather &#13;
        small angle is visible which indicates rather low speed", said Uno Laur. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        However the picture of the propellers do not say anything about the earlier &#13;
        speed. <b>Most important: Did they lower the speed after 3rd engineer &#13;
        Margus Treu had reported to the bridge that there was water on the car &#13;
        deck just after midnight (Swedish time), i.e. 35-40 minutes before 'Estonia' &#13;
        sank? <br/>&#13;
        The Angle Controls the Speed.</b> <br/>&#13;
        - Those in charge on the bridge can reduce the speed directly by changing &#13;
        the angles of the propellers (blades). The engineer has nothing to do. &#13;
        The four main engines can continue with unchanged revolutions, Laur pointed &#13;
        out. It is nowhere documented that those in charge on the bridge actually &#13;
        did reduce the speed after Treu's alarming them, said Laur. The combination &#13;
        of the damaged or torn off visor, open ramp and excessive speed might &#13;
        have been the death sentence for 'Estonia'. <br/><b>No Questions from the Owners </b><br/>&#13;
        The Estonian part of the JAIC, of which Uno Laur is the member directly &#13;
        representing the President has difficulties receiving the required information &#13;
        quickly which is probably due to the politicians trying to influence the &#13;
        investigation heavily. Already on the 29th September they requested drawings, &#13;
        sketches and calculations for different parts of the 'Estonia'. <br/>&#13;
        After six days, yesterday was Thursday, there was still no reaction. From &#13;
        B.V. the JAIC received a letter on Thursday with the offer to help. The &#13;
        letter was sent by normal mail and was thus only received after 6 days.<br/>&#13;
        Finally fax contact has been established with Paris and the Estonians &#13;
        have requested all relevant information from the classification society &#13;
        B.V., which surveyed 'Estonia' in the beginning of 1993, which included &#13;
        also the visor and the bow ramp. <br/>&#13;
        "They are frustrated that nobody has access to the drawings of visor and &#13;
        locking devices", said the marine engineer Heimo Jaakula, one of the Estonian &#13;
        experts and advisors. ..." </i></font></p>&#13;

      visor and whatever else might have been on the bottom of the sea in this &#13;
      area, however without informing the Estonians at all. On the other hand, &#13;
      the Estonians did withhold information, at least as long as possible, in &#13;

      of interest, i.e. the Finns and Swedes on the one side and the Estonians &#13;
      on the other, and it is quite obvious that it would be most advantageous &#13;
      for both sides if a casualty scenario and a cause consideration could be &#13;

        to have the wreck examined by divers, the above-mentioned installation &#13;
        should be brought up, according to Koivisto, the matter should be given &#13;
        a relatively high priority and should be speeded up. The Swedish pilot &#13;
        Benny Pettersson, who frequently piloted "Estonia" knows the exact location &#13;
        of the installation on the bridge. <br/>&#13;
        5. We hope to make video images of the key areas on the new video films. &#13;
        It is our intention to send a series of colour copies to each country &#13;
        before Tallinn. In addition we are preparing several copies for an eventual &#13;
        press information. I assume that a similar number of journalists will &#13;
        be coming to Tallinn as were at our last meeting in Turku. The really &#13;
        international press will hardly come at all. Yesterday when we published &#13;
        the Mayday tape there was only one journalist present who did not understand &#13;
        Swedish and Finnish. <br/>&#13;
        6. Finland's police have collected in Hangö Freeport the liferafts from &#13;
        "Estonia" that floated ashore and delivered by various vessels. There &#13;
        shall subsequently be an inspection report on each raft. FBN inspector &#13;
        Jan Jansson, who is also expert to PCIMA, had a look at them. There are &#13;
        also rafts in Estonia (some of them have already been stolen)." </i></font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was the day of the &#13;
      3rd meeting of the JAIC, this time in Tallinn. At the meeting the questioning &#13;
      of the key witnesses from the crew was continued respectively started again &#13;
      from the beginning. According to the notes of Tuomo Karppinen the 3rd engineer &#13;
      Margus Treu, the watch A.B. Silver Linde and the trainee mate Einar Kukk &#13;
      were heard. As usual with this commission it was not an organised taking &#13;
      of statements, but the witnesses were questioned in the presence of the &#13;
      whole JAIC and everybody asked what he wanted to ask. <br/>&#13;
      This time Treu's evidence had changed because he did not mention water on &#13;
      the car deck at 01.00 hours again which he previously said to have reported &#13;
      to the bridge, but now saw Linde at 01.00 hours on the car deck "coming &#13;
      from the pumping station for visor and ramp", although according to his &#13;
      own statement Linde was at 01.00 hours on the bridge and according to Kukk &#13;
      the vessel abruptly heeled to starboard at this time. It is unknown whether &#13;
      this remained unnoted by the audience or whether attempts were made to clarify &#13;
      these differences. The 2nd Interim Report of the JAIC reads as follows:</font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"At its meeting in &#13;
        Tallinn on 17 October 1994 the Joint Accident Investigation Commission &#13;
        (Sten Andersson did not attend) reviewed new information available to &#13;
        it as a result of additional video films taken from the sunken ship and &#13;
        confirmed the following conclusions of the First Interim Report:" </i><br/><b>Note: </b>The visor was still not found "officially". <br/><i>"I The bow visor was lost underway."</i> <br/><b>Note</b>: The JAIC believed that the visor was lost when the vessel &#13;
        was proceeding at full power against 4.5 m significant wave height which &#13;
        includes 8-9 m seas. This position was maintained all the time and is &#13;
        part of the scenario of the Final Report. <br/><i>"II Water entered the car deck at the forward ramp." </i><br/><b>Note</b>: This is true because it was observed by Treu, Kadak and Sillaste &#13;
        on the monitor and the ramp was found to be open at the wreck. <br/><i>"The Commission also assumed the following positions regarding the &#13;
        details and one of the most probable causes of the accident: <br/>&#13;
        1. The bow door (visor) has separated from the ship as a result of failure &#13;
        of all three locking mechanisms. According to the observations made by &#13;
        members of the crew this happened at about 01.15 when water was simultaneously &#13;
        observed on the TV-monitor, entering the car deck from openings along &#13;
        the vertical sides of the forward ramp. The failures have taken place, &#13;
        in case of the two side locks in the welding of the locking eye plates &#13;
        to the bow visor and in case of the centre lock (as previously shown) &#13;
        by failure of the lugs carrying the locking plunger unit." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> Already on the ROV videos from 02. and 09.10.94 the extremely &#13;
        thick welding seams of the side lock lugs are visible, which were created &#13;
        by cutting off/rewelding of the lugs several times as it was observed &#13;
        by many truck drivers - <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">see Subchapter &#13;
        12.5 </a>- however this is not mentioned by the JAIC.<br/><i>2. "Following the failure of the locking arrangements the bow visor &#13;
        has opened up under the wave loads. The deck mounted hinge points have &#13;
        eventually failed as a result of the uncontrolled movement of the 55 tons &#13;
        visor, leaving it attached only by the hydraulic actuating cylinders. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        3. During the subsequent unrestrained movement of the bow visor it hit &#13;
        the bow ramp in several modes, including hits from the rear to the upper &#13;
        protrusion of the ramp, causing it to become dislodged from its locking &#13;
        arrangements and to move to a partly open position. The bow visor has &#13;
        ultimately separated from the ship and disappeared overboard." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> Apparently at this time JAIC had not yet realised the interlock &#13;
        between visor and bow ramp, i.e. that the upper part of the ramp was extending &#13;
        into the ramp house being part of the visor, which means that if the visor &#13;
        would move forward the ramp would get in contact with the aft part of &#13;
        the ramp house. As long as the visor was empty however and the ramp properly &#13;
        locked and secured, nothing could have happened because the empty visor &#13;
        was unable to break the locks and hooks of the ramp as long as they were &#13;
        intact. Unfortunately neither was the case. See <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
        29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a>. <br/><i>4. "Partial opening of the ramp had allowed water to enter the car &#13;
        deck due to the heavy sea. Collection of water on the car deck eventually &#13;
        led to loss of stability and capsizing of the vessel." </i><br/><b>Note: </b>The JAIC does not yet say that the ramp was fully open but &#13;
        just states "partial opening". Nevertheless, the JAIC seems to believe &#13;
        that the opening was big enough to allow the penetration of a sufficient &#13;
        quantity of water within a very short time 01.15-01.30 hours, i.e. 15 &#13;
        minutes from visor off to vessel on the side. <br/><i>5. "After the vessel had turned over to almost 90 degrees starboard &#13;
        list, which is estimated to have taken place in less than twenty minutes &#13;
        after the damage to the forward ramp, it started to sink with the stern &#13;
        first. The ship disappeared from the radar screen of a Finnish surveillance &#13;
        station at 01.48. <br/>&#13;
        6. The vessel turned during the phase of losing stability and landed on &#13;
        the sea bed with an almost easterly heading. It is assumed at this stage &#13;
        this movement was partly the result of an attempt by the officers on the &#13;
        bridge to turn the ship around and partly by the wave action after the &#13;
        ship had lost propulsion power."</i><br/><b>Note</b>: They did not yet say whether the vessel turned to port to &#13;
        starboard.<br/><i>7. "The locations of the EPIRB-s have not been found during the video &#13;
        documentation and their status is therefore not known at the present time." &#13;
        </i><br/><b>Note</b>: At that time both EPIRB-s had been found in switched off &#13;
        condition already 15 days before, but this as well as the location of &#13;
        the visor were kept secret. <br/><i>8. "Emergency MAYDAY signals were sent by ESTONIA at 01.24 and were &#13;
        received by ships in the area and the MRCC at Turku." </i></font></p>&#13;

        Accident Commission convinced what cause the Estonia shipwreck. Estonia's &#13;
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together &#13;
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull made water flow &#13;
        on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the ship &#13;
        completely changed. <br/>&#13;
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces &#13;
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, &#13;
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the Accident Commission, who was not present &#13;
        at the Monday session in Tallinn. Also from other very informed sources &#13;
        DN has received the same information, that holes in the hull contributed &#13;
        to water getting into the ship so quickly (...) <br/>&#13;
        According to Sten Andersson the three visor locks, two on the sides and &#13;
        one at the bottom, was ripped off. This can be seen from the new underwater &#13;
        pictures taken. <br/>&#13;
        DN's source, with very good insight in the ship's construction, has difficulties &#13;
        to believe that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic lock - could &#13;
        have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. I rather believe that &#13;
        the visor attachments on the deck has broken and that the 54.5 ton visor &#13;
        fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock." "According to the source of &#13;
        DN this scenario gives "violent mechani-cal damages and big holes in the &#13;
        hull". Those holes will then be situated under the water line in the heavy &#13;
        sea." </i></font></p>&#13;

        ESTONIA Accident <br/>&#13;
        Further to our exchange of information yesterday, you have probably noticed &#13;
        that the bow door has now been found and identified. It is located on &#13;
        the seabed about 1 nautical mile west of the wreck itself. This seems &#13;
        to indicate that the captain has attempted to turn the ship around at &#13;

    <blockquote> &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The draft version states &#13;
      that "both fins seem to be in retracted position" while the final version &#13;
      states that only "the port side one seems to be in retracted position". &#13;
      This implies that Stenström knew that the starboard fin was not in retracted &#13;
      position, but apparently also not in extended position which should be the &#13;
      case created by gravity if the fin would have been intact. Since the starboard &#13;
      fin was apparently neither retracted nor extended, it has to be assumed &#13;
      that it was missing. <br/>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">During the month of November &#13;
      the Swedish JAIC spoke to:</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - the previous masters &#13;
      of the 'NORD ESTONIA' Per Ringhagen and Sten Levander, and further with &#13;
      the Stockholm pilots having piloted the ESTONIA frequently,<br/>&#13;
      - the employees of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm Shipinspec office,<br/>&#13;
      - the management of N&amp;T and Estline. From 9 to 18 November the visor was &#13;
      searched and finally lifted by the Finnish multipurpose ice breaker 'NORDICA' &#13;
      assisted by the Swedish mine hunter 'FURUSUND'. <a href="chapter26.htm" target="_blank">See &#13;
      Chapter 26. </a>During the lifting operation Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka &#13;
      from the Finnish JAIC were present on board of the 'NORDICA'. <br/>&#13;
      The visor was landed ashore in Hangö and put on blocks in upside down condition &#13;
      at the premises of Messrs. Levator Oy where it stayed in the open air until &#13;
      it was shipped to Sweden by the Swedish Navy in December 1999. The visor &#13;
      was closely examined by members and experts of the JAIC from all three countries &#13;
      and it was subsequently decided to have the bulkhead parts in way of the &#13;
      torn off lugs of the hydraulic side locks cut out and transported to the &#13;
      Royal Technical High School (KTH), Stockholm. This was carried out after &#13;
      the 23 November because when representatives of Meyer Werft inspected the &#13;
      visor for the first time on that day these parts were still in position &#13;
      and are thus visible on the photos then made. <br/>&#13;
      Andi Meister writes in his book "<i>The Unfinished Logbook"</i> about the &#13;
      visor inspection as follows:</font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"On 2 December the &#13;
        inspection of the visor in Hangö took place. In addition to the other &#13;
        acknowledged experts also the scientists of the Estonian Shipping Company &#13;
        (ESCO) and of the Technical University of Tallinn, August Ingerma and &#13;
        Jaan Metsaveer, participated. It was now also established by means of &#13;
        squeezed steel parts that the visor had pulled open the ramp and that &#13;
        the ramp had been completely open until becoming partly closed again when &#13;
        the vessel turned upside down."</i></font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Swedish Government &#13;
      had instructed Sjöfartsverket already on 3 October to develop possibilities &#13;
      to recover the bodies out of the wreck and it was thus decided to have the &#13;
      wreck examined by divers. A description of the work required was drawn up &#13;
      in the form of tender conditions which were sent to 14 contractors - see &#13;
      also Chapter 27 - and the job was finally awarded to Smit-Tak/Rockwater, &#13;
      i.e. Smit, Rotterdam, the world's leading salvage company. The contract &#13;
      was signed on 29 November and the work began on 1 December, however, was &#13;
      delayed due to the wrong wreck position stated in the tender conditions &#13;
      - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27.</a> <br/>&#13;
      Also the JAIC was given the opportunity of having parts of the wreck examined &#13;
      and taken up. In order to make the necessary decisions Börje Stenström (and &#13;
      most probably Tuomo Karppinen) attended on board the diving support vessel &#13;
      'SEMI I' while the Estonian side was represented by Aarne Valgma, the head &#13;
      of the Sea Safety Division of the E.N.M.B. and the man who could have prevented &#13;
      the last sailing of the ESTONIA (and consequently her sinking). <br/>&#13;
      As the JAIC had made up their mind already what had caused the sinking of &#13;
      the ferry, their interest remained restricted to the bow area and to some &#13;
      limited extent to the bridge where allegedly three bodies had been found &#13;
      (although there were at least 5), which were allegedly not identified although &#13;
      some of them were wearing uniforms. The cabins of master, chief engineer, &#13;
      radio officer and the owners' cabin all located directly below the bridge &#13;
      were allegedly not examined. At least nothing is mentioned in the official &#13;
      reports. There was however another "unofficial" diving investigation going &#13;
      on at the same time - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;
      27</a>, <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 34.6 </a>and the Disengage &#13;
      Report in <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
      34.6.434.</a> - the result of which regrettably has never been made public. &#13;
      It is certain however that the work of this "unofficial" diving team was &#13;
      executed with the consent - if not on instruction - of a certain Swedish &#13;
      government authority. A number of objects from the wreck were recovered &#13;
      by divers and brought to the surface, among others the lugs of the Atlantic &#13;
      locks burnt off in a rather unprofessional way, i.e. each lug was burnt &#13;
      off instead of burning off the whole deck part to which the lugs were welded. &#13;
      Due to this way of burning, the bottom parts of the lugs - say the lower &#13;
      20-30% were missing - which made the lugs look rather small. Also the sensor &#13;
      plate fitted next to the lugs was burnt off but thrown to the sea bottom &#13;
      by the diver and thus disappeared forever. <br/><b>Note</b>: The examination of this sensor plate ashore would doubtless &#13;
      have proven that the holes for the screws having previously held the sensors &#13;
      were corroded to such an extent that it would have been obvious that the &#13;
      sensors had been removed already several months before the casualty, a violation &#13;
      of the class requirements which would have forced B.V. to withdraw the class &#13;
      of the ferry in hindsight with substantial consequences for the owners. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      In addition to the sensor plate also the sensor cables were clipped off &#13;
      and thrown to the sea bottom by the diver obviously for the same reason, &#13;
      because on the video footage it is clearly visible that these cables were &#13;
      cut and not broken by being torn off, of which N&amp;T tried to persuade B.V. &#13;
      and the JAIC in endless argumentation and writings. Obviously with success &#13;
      because B.V. did not withdraw the class nor did B.V. ever criticise N&amp;T/ESCO &#13;
      and the JAIC just noted on page 128, Subchapter 8.6.6 of their Final Report: &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"The magnetic-type &#13;
        position sensors for the bottom lock were not in position on their mounting &#13;
        bracket according to pictures taken during the ROV and diving investigations. &#13;
        The electric cabling that had been part of the sensor installation and &#13;
        the ends of the cables were visible in the area. The mounting bracket &#13;
        for the sensors appeared to be intact or possibly bent slightly aft. No &#13;
        other signs of any mechanical action could be seen on the bracket. The &#13;
        12-millimetre-diameter bolt holes for the originally installed mechanical &#13;
        switches were empty. It is not fully clear how the magnetic sensors had &#13;
        been installed on the bracket. The magnet which was part of the bottom &#13;
        lock position indicator was after the accident visible on its mounting &#13;
        bracket in the locking bolt. According to information obtained from the &#13;
        electrical engineer who installed the magnetic sensors and the magnet &#13;
        in the mid-1980s they were of the Siemens 3SE6-type." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> According to a member of the 2nd crew the sensors had been &#13;
        dismounted and the cables were cut at the end of the ice winter in April &#13;
        1994. The sensors were not reinstalled as the crew members had to go down &#13;
        anyway and open respectively close the bolt of the Atlantic lock by hammering, &#13;
        as this was no more possible hydraulically due to the severe misalignment &#13;
        and distortions of the lugs. Therefore a remote control was no more required. &#13;

    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Atlantic lock bolt, &#13;
      however, a most important piece of evidence in the JAIC's chain of argumentation, &#13;
      was brought to the surface but, much to the surprise of the outside world, &#13;
      thrown back into the sea by Stenström, allegedly after having measured its &#13;
      thickness and found it to be undamaged and straight, a statement, which &#13;
      is apparently false, as must be concluded from the rather good video footage &#13;
      available - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2.</a><br/>&#13;
      It has to be assumed that Stenström very well realised from the explanations &#13;
      and pictures of the diver that the lugs of the hydraulic side locks could &#13;
      do substantial damage to the JAIC scenario when brought up to the surface &#13;
      and subsequently being examined ashore. The extremely thick welding seams &#13;
      would have proven that they consisted of several welds on top of each other, &#13;
      i.e. frequent cutting off/rewelding had taken place. Furthermore it would &#13;
      have become known that the missing bulkhead parts to cover the holes in &#13;
      both aft bulkheads of the visor (where the lugs had been sitting) were not &#13;
      attached to the lugs (apart from a tiny piece). This meant that the lugs &#13;
      had no more been welded to the bulkheads as original but had just been stuck &#13;
      through pre-cut holes and then welded on to the remnants of previous welding &#13;
      seams. Al this was naturally combined with a substantial reduction of the &#13;
      initial load carrying capacity of the locks. Stenström decided to leave &#13;
      the locks in the wreck. <br/>&#13;
      The recovery of the visor hinge bolts which had already been ordered to &#13;
      the divers was stopped also. A close examination of these bolts would have &#13;
      brought results - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2 &#13;
      </a>- for the JAIC casualty scenario. <br/>&#13;
      By fax of 06.12.1994 to Andi Meister, Stenström briefly reports on the diving &#13;
      inspection (see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27</a>) &#13;
      and concludes:</font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Findings in the &#13;
        bow area generally <b>confirmed the earlier hypothesis of the development &#13;
        of the accident.</b> Broken lugs of the bottom lock of the visor were &#13;
        recovered for detailed examination. One hinge for the visor was also recovered. &#13;
        Damages on the bow area and the ramp were documented. <br/><b>The findings support the hypothesis that the visor broke loose from &#13;

        to move</b>. The visor thereby forced the ramp open due to mechanical &#13;
        interference. <b>The visor probably brought the ramp to fully open position &#13;
        at the time it was leaving the ship.</b> The visor tumbled forward over &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In a memo of the same &#13;
      date he goes more into detail on his hypothetical assumptions:</font></p>&#13;

        hull mounted part intact, hinge separated.<br/>&#13;
        Number 2. Both lugs on ramp lower beam broken, hinge separated. <br/>&#13;
        Number 3. No damage, some play at pin. <br/>&#13;
        Number 4, starboard side. No damage, same play at pin." </i><br/><b>Note</b>: Stenström does not state that the port outer hinge was found &#13;
        to be bent and misaligned, with the bolt moved to starboard, both securing &#13;
        plates missing and the port "outer eye" (lug) slipped off the bolt. He &#13;
        also failed to mention the mattresses, bed-clothing, blankets and rags &#13;
        squeezed between ramp and bulkhead at the port outer ramp hinge, although &#13;
        this had become public knowledge (see DN of 07.10., page 59 above). <br/><i>"2. Ramp front side.<br/>&#13;
        Heavy damage at lower end, most at starboard side. <br/>&#13;
        Ramp beams damaged at lower ends and in centre line at mid length (possible &#13;
        contact with fore peak deck locating horn)."</i><br/><b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention that the ramp is bent longitudinally, &#13;
        is resting on the starboard bulkhead with a gap existing between the port &#13;
        bulkhead and the ramp, i.e. that the ramp has been exposed to pressure &#13;
        from port to starboard, which had led to very severe deformations of all &#13;
        the transverse beams, except for the lower ones and to deformation of &#13;
        the longitudinal beams in the lower area which he interpreted to have &#13;
        been caused by contact with the forepeak deck. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2.</a><br/><i>"3. Ramp inner side.<br/>&#13;
        Some damage at top." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> He means apparently the damage to the port outer beam which &#13;
        was bent and distorted at the upper side, but the severe damage to the &#13;
        inner ramp plating in the upper third with burnt and distorted plates &#13;
        and also the distorted flaps in way of the centre line at the top and &#13;
        the bottom of the ramp are not mentioned. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2. &#13;
        </a><br/><i>"4. Ramp actuating cylinders. <br/>&#13;
        Port side one found extended, rod end failed." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> The videos clearly show that the port ramp actuator was sitting &#13;
        in <b>retracted</b> condition inside the bulkhead opening with the piston &#13;
        rod broken at the lug fitted to the lugs at the ramp side. These lugs &#13;
        at the ramp side were missing. The videos also show that the starboard &#13;
        ramp actuator was also broken, once at the lug, same as the port one, &#13;
        but again at the piston rod because this part was found by the diver to &#13;
        be jammed in between ramp and bulkhead recess. The remains of the piston &#13;
        rod and the actuator were noted inside the bulkhead in retracted condition. &#13;
        The lugs at the ramp side are missing, the fastening of these lugs was &#13;
        found to be blown open and distorted. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a> &#13;
        and <a href="chapter32.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 32</a>.<br/><i>"5. <b>Ramp locking plungers.</b> <br/>&#13;
        Starboard side ones, both in extended position, mating boxes deformed. &#13;
        Port side ones, upper one in fully extended position, mating box deformed, &#13;
        lower one partly extended, no visible damage to mating box." </i><br/><b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention the diver's report that there &#13;
        was a misalignment of 21/2 inches = 10 cm at port side between the plungers &#13;
        (bolts) and the mating boxes which also existed between the ramp hook &#13;
        and the mating lug. He also did not mention that both port mating boxes &#13;
        as well as the mating lug and the ramp hook were found to be intact which &#13;
        means that the entire port side of the bow ramp had not been secured at &#13;
        all upon departure from Tallinn (and numerous voyages before already). &#13;

        plating although only a very tiny part of the bulk-head, less than 1/10 &#13;
        of the contact area, was found to be attached to the lugs and the diver &#13;
        reported that no bulk-head parts were attached to the lugs at all. "<br/><i>8. <b>Visor hinges. </b><br/>&#13;
        Deck lugs intact, no visible twisting. Design deviates, however, from &#13;
        that shown on drawings. Starboard side one has been beaten by visor arm &#13;
        more than the port side one. One hinge bushing recovered for examination." &#13;

        the starboard one without bushing and the port one with the inner bushing &#13;
        attached. Both bolts could have been recovered without big problems by &#13;
        the crane of 'SEMI I'. At this time the cracks in the welds of the visor &#13;
        hinges had already been known to the Estonians for 2 months, however, &#13;
        the Finns and Swedish JAIC members were not informed.<br/><b><i>"9. Front bulkhead.</i></b><i><br/>&#13;
        Not much damage except around port side locating horn and ruptures caused &#13;

        upper part to such an extent that the diver could move through it and &#13;
        the lower side was found cracked off the hull and bulged forwards. See &#13;

        about 70% of the channels partly extending up to the front bulkheads (also &#13;
        noted by Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée - see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;
        15</a>). Also the severely hammered stempost area is not mentioned.<br/><i>"11.<b> Bulbous bow. </b><br/>&#13;
        Heavy scratch marks on ice breaker horn, clear evidence on front and bottom &#13;
        of bulb from contact with visor." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> This is correct, however, the marks and even damage are only &#13;
        proof for contact with some object, not necessarily the visor.<br/><i>"<b>12. Navigation bridge.</b><br/>&#13;
        One Shipmate GPS navigator recovered for possible retrieval of data. The &#13;
        navigation PC could not be found. The engine control levers on port side &#13;
        bridge wing and on centre console were in full astern position." </i><br/><b>Note: </b>The examination of the bridge - under the aspect of acci-dent &#13;
        investigation - was totally unacceptable, for example Stenström failed &#13;
        to have the divers establish: <br/>&#13;
        (a) course on the gyros which would have indicated the heading of the &#13;
        vessel at the time the auxiliary engines stopped; <br/>&#13;
        (b) whether the auto pilot was switched on/off which would have indicated &#13;
        whether they were steering manually already;<br/>&#13;
        (c) whether the stabilisers were activated or not; <br/>&#13;
        (d) the identity of the bodies by means of their ranks indicated on their &#13;
        uniforms and the type of clothes of plain clothed bodies. <br/>&#13;
        (e) whether any documents were still possibly legible (Stenström most &#13;
        likely knew that the logbook had been recovered already in the early days &#13;
        of October 1994 by Swedish Navy divers). <br/><i>"The controls for the watertight doors were found to be push button &#13;
        switches and no information about ordered positions of the doors could &#13;
        therefore be found. The watertight door checked by the divers was in closed &#13;
        position." </i><br/><b>Note: </b>The door closed from port to starboard, thus closed anyway &#13;
        by gravity due to the starboard list of the wreck. <br/><i>"<b>13. EPIRB beacon.</b><br/>&#13;
        One casing for an EPIRB beacon was found on top of the bridge, the other &#13;
        position was inaccessible for the diver. The casing was open and empty. &#13;
        The casing was recovered for further investigation."</i><br/><b>Note: </b>At this time both EPIRBs had already been in the possession &#13;
        of the Estonians for more than 2 months, but the Swedish and Finnish JAIC &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">It is quite obvious that &#13;
      the JAIC was dominated by technicians, in particular by naval architects &#13;
      like Börje Stenström. Thus also the investigation was performed from the &#13;
      technical points of view of shipbuilders. It is unknown whether the master &#13;
      mariners Hans Rosengren and Olle Noord were always happy with the rapid &#13;
      development of the cause consideration and casualty scenario in which the &#13;
      surrounding circumstances, in particular the nautical ones, were often grossly &#13;
      neglected. <br/>&#13;
      On 6 December 1994 Börje Stenström, accompanied by his assistant Mikael &#13;
      Huss, also naval architect and lecturer at the KTH, Stockholm, visited Meyer &#13;
      Werft in Papenburg for the second time. They had brought the starboard and &#13;
      centre lugs of the Atlantic lock with them for demonstration purposes. According &#13;
      to the notes of Dr. Holtappels Stenström explained the following: </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">1. Bottom lock (Atlantic &#13;
        lock) failed due to overload, no fatigue.<br/>&#13;
        2. Side locks have not taken much load due to lack of structure. <br/>&#13;
        3. Wind 20m/sec., significant wave height 4-4.5 m, single waves 7-8 m; &#13;

        Summary of Technical Findings and Technical Evaluation of the Probable &#13;
        Sequence of Events and Cause of the Accident.<br/></i></b><i>The investigation of technical facts related to the accident &#13;
        has continued with high priority. <b>The findings and conclusions reported &#13;
        and agreed on during the meeting on 17th October in Tallinn are essentially &#13;
        still valid</b> but various additional findings have been made and the &#13;
        related probable development of the accident has been further clarified &#13;
        and modified. .... <br/>&#13;
        The summary below describes the technical findings and also the effect &#13;
        these may have had on the development of the accident. <br/>&#13;
        1. All evidence found so far confirm the hypothesis that the mechanical &#13;
        failure started with failure of the lower locks of the visor. Most probably &#13;
        the bottom lock failed first. The mounting lugs for this lock have been &#13;
        recovered from the wreck. <b>They indicate that the failure in the lugs &#13;
        has been caused by overload and also that the actual welding of the locking &#13;
        plunger housing to the lugs has been less extensive than presumed in the &#13;
        engineering calculations. The total load carrying capacity of the mounting &#13;
        of the bottom lock has therefore been less than intended. </b>The internal &#13;
        work routines of the shipyard relevant for this condition are being discussed &#13;
        with the yard."</i><br/></font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Note:</b> <b>1. Failure &#13;
        in the lugs has been caused by overload: </b><br/>&#13;
        The subsequent investigation by Prof. Hoffmeister - see <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
        34.8</a> - Enclosure 34.8.436 - proved that the welding seams between &#13;
        "locking plunger housing" and lugs were up to 90% penetrated by fatigue &#13;
        cracks. <br/><b>2. Welding of the "locking plunger housing" to the lugs has been less &#13;
        extensive than presumed in the engineering calculations:</b><br/>&#13;
        The welding seams found were about 3 mm thick while according to the Meyer &#13;
        yard welders having done the job, they were 7-8 mm thick originally which &#13;
        was also in conformity with the yard's standard welding rules when welding &#13;
        a 15 mm thick component to a structure. In such case each weld had to &#13;
        correspond to 50% of the thickness of the component to be welded. Thus &#13;
        it has to assumed that the welds and probably also the lugs were not original &#13;
        and definitely the rather poor repair welds of the starboard lug did not &#13;
        originate from the yard. - See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
        12.5</a>. - The JAIC was not interested and arranged for a paint analysis &#13;
        of the starboard lug only in December 1996. <br/>&#13;
        3. The total load carrying capacity (lcc) of the bottom lock has therefore &#13;
        been less than intended.<br/>&#13;
        According to Stenström's own calculation the lcc of the Atlantic lock &#13;
        had been only 70-80 ts. while actually a subsequent break test with 3 &#13;
        m welds revealed a break load of 220 ts. See <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;

          the vessel had traded in the area with similar weather conditions for &#13;

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>38.5 Further<br/>&#13;
    Investigations and Meetings </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">At the beginning of September &#13;
    6 Finnish statements of the key witnesses of the crew and the statement taken &#13;
    in Hangö from the nautical student Rain Oolmets were received from the Finnish &#13;
    JAIC. Almost one year after the casualty had passed before the first statements &#13;
    could be studied and evaluated by this 'Group of Experts'! <br/>&#13;
    In the meantime Stenström continued to give interviews in support of the JAIC &#13;
    scenario and cause consideration and, in particular, drew the attention of &#13;
    the media to the poor condition of part of the visor hinges and the locking &#13;
    devices for which, in his view, the building yard was to be blamed with the &#13;
    naïve argument that the JAIC was unable to find anybody who would admit to &#13;
    have done repairs as sloppy as described during the lifetime of the vessel, &#13;
    or that they could not find any recording on them.<br/>&#13;
    Nevertheless the communication between Stenström and this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    was continued. <br/>&#13;
    At a further meeting in Stockholm on 2 October Stenström reported that the &#13;
    next JAIC meeting would be on 17/18 October in Tallinn. At the subsequent &#13;
    meeting in Stockholm on 5 December, the technical part written by him - see &#13;
    the Part-Report - would be finally agreed upon. The JAIC's scenario and cause &#13;
    considerations would not be changed. Nevertheless, he agreed to have a look &#13;
    at the facts considered by this 'Group of Experts' not to be in dispute and, &#13;
    further, to another meeting to be held in Stockholm during the first week &#13;
    in November. Stenström also reported that the tank tests with a model of the &#13;
    ESTONIA had shown that at a speed of 10 kn the same loads on the visor occurred &#13;
    as at a speed of 14.5 kn, however not as often. <br/>&#13;
    Stenström furthermore admitted that up to 30 ts. water could have been in &#13;
    the visor. <br/>&#13;
    Note: This was not surprising because this is the quantity indicated by the &#13;
    highest water mark visible inside the visor. <br/>&#13;
    This means that the lower part of the bow ramp including the hinges had been &#13;
    under water. Stenström further stated that the heavy damage to the port outer &#13;
    ramp hinge - as visible on the videos - had existed already since some time &#13;
    before the casualty. As a result - in his opinion - the bow ramp could not &#13;
    be closed properly at the port lower edge, thus was open to the visor up to &#13;
    about 20 mm. This - so he said - was also the reason why the port lower securing &#13;
    bolt of the ramp was unable to engage its mating pocket at the ramp side. &#13;
    He then stated that the Estonian crew had put this severe damage repeatedly &#13;
    on the repair list since some time already, however without N&amp;T doing anything. &#13;
    He said that he had copies of these repair lists. Stenström argued further &#13;
    that because the bow ramp had been partly open for some time already, there &#13;
    must have always been water on the car deck if the theory of the German 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' would be correct. However, as there had obviously not always been &#13;
    water on the car deck the visor could not have been filled to the outside &#13;
    water level. Unfortunately the observations of previous passengers and, in &#13;
    particular, the statement of Pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.4.161</a> and <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.4.4</a> &#13;
    - were at that time not yet known to this 'Group of Experts'. They prove beyond &#13;
    reasonable doubt that there had indeed been water on the car deck already &#13;
    in 1993 and the worse the weather got the more water had been on the car deck.<br/>&#13;
    In any event, Stenström had stated that the bow ramp could no more be properly &#13;
    closed for some time before the casualty, that the crew had demanded repairs &#13;
    which were rejected by N&amp;T. It follows already from this fact that the ferry &#13;
    had been initially unseaworthy with the knowledge of the technical managers &#13;
    and owners since some time before the casualty already. No mention of this &#13;
    serious deficiency is made in the Final Report with the exception of the following &#13;
    remark on page 42 - <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.3.6</a> &#13;
    - "It was known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point &#13;
    where corrective action would be needed". <br/>&#13;
    By letter of 27 October the "the undisputed facts" were submitted by this &#13;
    'Group of Experts' to the JAIC and a copy of the letter is attached as Enclosure &#13;
    38.5. <br/>&#13;
    Note: The letter was registered on 2 November 1995 under B125 in the logbook &#13;
    of the Swedish JAIC and was declared classified until 9 March 1998. <br/>&#13;
    This 'Group of Experts' expressed once again its regret that it was not possible &#13;
    for the JAIC to travel to Hamburg and/or Papenburg:<br/><i>"Once again we have to express our regret that is has not been possible &#13;
    for you to visit us here in Hamburg and/or in Papenburg. Many things would &#13;
    have been much easier to transfer to you respectively prove to you, if you &#13;
    would have spoken to the individuals personally and asked your own questions, &#13;
    be that now the von Tell representative Todsen, the BV surveyor Lohmann or &#13;
    the welders, locksmiths, foreman, etc. of Meyer Werft having been engaged &#13;
    respectively responsible, e.g. for the welding of bushings into the lugs of &#13;
    the Atlantic lugs or the lugs to A-deck or the steel bushings into the bores &#13;
    of the visor arms etc., all of whom have been identified. Anyway this can &#13;
    still be arranged if you should wish so."" </i><br/>&#13;
    As there was no response, it was decided to take one of the welders to Stockholm &#13;
    to the next meeting. This was welder Koenen who had welded, among other things, &#13;
    the locking devices in the foreship area of ESTONIA during its construction. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    The next meeting with the JAIC took place in Stockholm on 9/10 November and &#13;
    before the meeting this 'Group of Experts', together with the Meyer Werft &#13;
    welder Koenen, had about two hours time to look - undisturbed and in detail &#13;
    - at the recovered objects stored in the basement of the KTH. The comments &#13;
    of welder Koenen after this close inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs can &#13;
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">To begin with the findings &#13;
    and conclusion of the inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs were submitted &#13;
    in detail and in summary. It was concluded that the lugs of the Atlantic lock &#13;
    welded to the forepeak deck were no more original. Due to the red paint below &#13;
    the blue it had to be assumed, however, that the lugs had been exchanged already &#13;
    when the vessel was still "VIKING SALLY" which was noted by the JAIC in silence &#13;
    and without further comments.<br/>&#13;
    Subsequently the participants of the JAIC were invited to ask questions to &#13;
    welder Koenen about the yard practice, welding standards or whatever else, &#13;
    but in particular about their view expressed as in the Part-Report conclusions, &#13;
    namely:<br/>&#13;
    "<i>- The visor locking devices were constructed with less strength than required &#13;
    according to calculations. It is believed that this discrepancy developed &#13;
    due to lack of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions &#13;
    for certain parts of the devices."</i> Not a single question was, however, &#13;
    put to welder Koenen who left with the impression that none of the experts &#13;
    of the JAIC was the least interested in his testimony. His impression was &#13;
    correct, because the JAIC reiterated in their Final Report what they had assumed &#13;
    to be the facts already in November 1994. <br/><i>"The attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic &#13;
    calculations required. It is believed that this discrepancy was due to lack &#13;
    of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions for certain &#13;
    parts of the devices." </i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The meeting went on and as &#13;
    this was the last meeting in Sweden and also the last one with Börje Stenström &#13;
    attending, the subjects of discussions shall be outlined in some detail:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> JAIC: The vessel was assigned &#13;
    the highest B.V. class symbol, it could consequently operate in worldwide &#13;
    trade.<br/>&#13;
    German 'Group of Experts': This is true, however, the trading area of a passenger &#13;
    vessel is defined in the PSSC, which is issued only after the class certificate &#13;
    has been submitted to F.B.N. The PSSC restricted the trade of the vessel to &#13;
    "kustfaart mellan Finland och Sverige", i.e. coastal trade between Finland &#13;
    and Sweden. <br/>&#13;
    JAIC: This restriction referred to the radio operator only. In case AB Sally &#13;
    would have put a radio operator onboard the ferry could have traded "Short &#13;
    international voyages", i.e. 600 nm between 2 ports and no more than 200 nm &#13;
    from the next port, i.e. the ferry could have sailed between Helsinki and &#13;
    Gothenburg. <br/>&#13;
    German 'Group of Experts': It had been agreed in the building contract that &#13;
    the vessel had to be built for an "intended trade", i.e. for the Viking Line &#13;
    service Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm. <br/>&#13;
    JAIC: This referred only to the "partial collision door" while the contract &#13;
    is otherwise open. <br/>&#13;
    German 'Group of Experts': The well known fact that the "partial collision &#13;
    door" was not installed is indeed proof that the vessel was built for a particular &#13;
    trade, for which according to the opinion of the responsible maritime administration &#13;
    - F.B.N. - such a "partial collision door" at the location required by SOLAS &#13;
    was not necessary.<br/>&#13;
    JAIC: It was also in 1979/80 a well known fact that the Finnish and Swedish &#13;
    owners sold their ferries after 8-10 years in service to owners operating &#13;
    in entirely different areas of the world. Thus it would only be logical to &#13;
    build the ferries for worldwide trade.<br/>&#13;
    German 'Group of Experts': This is the shipowners' concern. The yard builds &#13;
    the vessel according to the contractual agreements, class rules and requirements &#13;
    of the maritime administration.<br/>&#13;
    Subsequently the development of the ferries built for AB Slite and AB Sally &#13;
    from 1969 to 1980 beginning with "APOLLO" and "DIANA" and ending with "VIKING &#13;
    SALLY" was explained, the discussion between Sjöfartsverket/Wahnes on basis &#13;
    of his logbook concerning "bow ramp = collision bulkhead" for "DIANA II" the &#13;
    attitude of the F.B.N. as to "VIKING SALLY", etc. were outlined. Further the &#13;
    "Copenhagen Convention" was handed over as well as this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    report about "The description of the process of conversion from design to &#13;
    production of the locking devices" which can be found as part of Subchapter &#13;
    2.4.6. This 'Group of Experts' explained also the background of the "partial &#13;
    collision door" clause in the "VIKING SALLY" specification ("EARL OF GRANVILLE" &#13;
    conversion) and the initial offer of the yard to install this partial collision &#13;
    door for DM 45.000,-- which was rejected by the owners. It would, however, &#13;
    have been possible at any time to have these doors installed for less than &#13;
    DM 100.000,-- in case the trading area would be changed to outside of "sheltered &#13;
    waters" as it occurred when the ferry's route was changed to Tallinn-Stockholm. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    JAIC: Probably a yard has to argue differently than a Government commission, &#13;
    who will definitely and sharply draw attention to the faulty practice followed &#13;
    by the maritime administrations of the Nordic countries for decades by accepting &#13;
    the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead on car/passenger &#13;
    ferries. The JAIC is of the considered opinion that according to SOLAS the &#13;
    maritime administra-tions may not grant exemptions in this respect, even not &#13;
    if the ferry trades regularly within 20 nm from the nearest land. Stenström &#13;
    said that it is a fact that in the Baltic about 70 ferries have been trading &#13;
    on which the bow ramp was the collision bulkhead. Of these 70 ferries 35 had &#13;
    the interlock between ramp and visor. The first vessel with such a construction &#13;
    was built in Finland. Meyer Werft is not responsible for it, Stenström said. &#13;
    It is considered a fact that the way "VIKING SALLY's" visor/bow ramp were &#13;
    built corresponded in those years absolutely to the state of the art and technique. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 November Klaus Rahka &#13;
    from the Finnish JAIC phoned a member of this 'Group of Experts' and reported &#13;
    the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <ul><li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had carried out &#13;
      a break test with the mock-up of a side lock. It broke at 134 ts. load.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They further carried &#13;
      out a bending test with the mock-up of the visor lug being part of the Atlantic &#13;
      lock. The load required to cause a deformation as found was found to be &#13;
      200 ts., i.e. the Atlantik lock had held at least 200 ts according to Klaus &#13;
      Rahka.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström was present &#13;
      during the tests and his comment at the end was: "We are not changing the &#13;
      report. Why should we be that friendly to the yard?" </font></li>&#13;
  </ul><p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This attitude was also reflected &#13;
    in the next telephone conversation on 12 December when Börje Stenström stated &#13;
    the following:</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The publication of the &#13;
    Final Report had been postponed.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had a full commission &#13;
    meeting last Monday/Tuesday (04./ 05.12) with Andi Meister, Enn Neidre, Uno &#13;
    Laur and two professors attending from Estonia. </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Purpose of the meeting was &#13;
    to establish what else had to be done.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> As far as the technical &#13;
    side was concerned (his job) they believed that the factual side was well &#13;
    covered by the Part-Report already, which would not be changed very much, &#13;
    although some analysis will still be carried out.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On the operational side &#13;
    they would have a long distance to go because the Estonians practically had &#13;
    not delivered anything, although Andi Meister - being no more a Minister - &#13;
    was said to be writing every day. Enn Neidre and Uno Laur have neither commented &#13;
    in writing nor verbally, they are absolutely passive. T</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">he Swedish and Finnish side &#13;
    developed the opinion they have to investigate the operational/educational &#13;
    side themselves, but do not know how, because the information is more or less &#13;
    exclusively in Estonia. They had hoped that something would come from their &#13;
    Minister, but so far in vain.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Next meeting will only &#13;
    be mid February 1996. </font> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This means that the date &#13;
      for the publication of the Final JAIC Report, announced with so much enthusiasm &#13;
      only a couple of months before had been postponed to some unknown time in &#13;
      the future. <br/>&#13;
      In this connection a fax has to be mentioned which was sent by Kari Lethola &#13;
      already on 12 November to Olof Forssberg only, which reads - office translation &#13;
      - as follows:<br/><i>"Representatives of the F.B.N., Chief Director Muttilainen (No. 2 in &#13;
      the organisation), Valkonen, the legal man Makkonen and the engineer Fabricius &#13;
      - met at the beginning of last week in Hamburg Holtappels, Hummel and possibly &#13;
      some other representatives of Jos. L. Meyer Werft. The yard had invited &#13;
      them to come to Hamburg. Simo Aarnio interviewed Makkonen subsequently. &#13;
      Makkonen repor-ted that the yard's representatives had first asked whether &#13;
      the F.B.N. had anything "against the yard". The answer was no. Possibly &#13;
      the yard wanted to check whether there could be a conflict of interests &#13;
      between F.B.N. and the yard in case of possible legal proceedings in the &#13;
      future. Thereafter they presented the results of their investigation. I &#13;
      hope that we shall have the same information after the Friday meeting in &#13;
      Stockholm. In any event, they do further maintain their theory that the &#13;
      hinges broke first and not the Atlantic Sicherung. Fabricius took the same &#13;
      view during subsequent discussions. He had inspected the visor in Hangö &#13;
      before the trip to Hamburg. Tuomo and Klaus shall come and interview Fabricius &#13;
      pretty soon. <br/>&#13;
      The Papenburgers have also pointed out that "Estonia" had traded with a &#13;
      water-filled visor for quite a long time already (almost all the time). &#13;
      There are clear indications for that inside the visor.<br/>&#13;
      Holtappels did further indicate that in case of possible legal proceedings &#13;
      against the yard they would right from the beginning disregard the JAIC &#13;
      investigation results to the effect that no one could use it as evidence &#13;
      against the yard. This would be done on the grounds of bias (partiality) &#13;
      of all three Estonian members. Holtappels did not give any reason for this, &#13;
      but possibly he means that </i></font></p>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi (Meister) had at &#13;
    the time of the casualty the political responsi-bility for the appropriate &#13;
    safety rules and also because the govern-ment had been the owner of the company, &#13;
    which partly owned the vessel and/or had been the operator.</font></i></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Enn (Neidre) is working &#13;
    as safety chief for Estline, which partly owned the vessel. </font></i></li>&#13;
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Uno (Laur) was Enn's &#13;
    predecessor in this job.</font> </i> &#13;
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> We shall possibly continue &#13;
      to discuss this matter. <br/>&#13;
      Regards, Kari" </font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The contents of this fax &#13;
      allows the following rather astonishing conclusions:</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) Even after almost &#13;
      14 months of "joint" investigations the Estonians - although being in the &#13;
      chair - were not informed and thus did not take part in crucial decisions &#13;
      concerning the reliability and credibility of JAIC. <br/>&#13;
      (b) The chairmen of the Finnish and Swedish JAICs were pretty much aware &#13;
      of the background of all three Estonian members and as Olof Forssberg reported &#13;
      to Inez Uzman, the Swedish Minister for Communication and Transport, and &#13;
      Kari Lethola reported to the Minister for Justice in Helsinki, it has to &#13;
      be assumed with certainty that the problems were well known at least inside &#13;
      these administrations as parts of the respective Governments. Nevertheless &#13;
      nothing was done from their side until Dr. Holtappels raised the point. &#13;
      It finally led to the resignation of Enn Neidre in April 1996 as member &#13;
      of the JAIC. He remained, however, an expert of the Estonian JAIC and as &#13;
      such participated undisturbed in the work, had access to the complete documentation, &#13;
      attended the meetings as before and even participated in the drafting of &#13;
      the Final Report. Whether this nominal change in the position of Enn Neidre &#13;
      did improve the reliability and credibility of the JAIC is a question for &#13;
      the reader to decide. <br/>&#13;
      (c) Remarkable is finally how experts with differing opinions - like Mr. &#13;
      Fabricius - were being treated: Tuomo and Klaus had "to talk" to him. <br/>&#13;
      Note: As a matter of fact engineer Fabricius never showed up again in this &#13;
      case. <br/>&#13;
      (d) The meeting between the F.B.N. and this 'Group of Experts' was already &#13;
      the second one and confidentiality had been agreed. The validity of agreements &#13;
      with the management of F.B.N. seems to be rather short. In this case it &#13;
      was broken by F.B.N. immediately after their return to Helsinki. <br/>&#13;
      At a subsequent meeting in Helsinki on 23 November between Kari Lethola/ &#13;
      Klaus Rahka and a member of this 'Group of Experts' the following information &#13;
      was received:<br/>&#13;
      - Andi Meister, the head of the International Commission (IHK), was no more &#13;
      the Estonian Minister of Transport but was sitting at his home writing the &#13;
      Estonian version of the report; they had so far however received nothing. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      - Uno Laur as the personal representative of the President of Estonia in &#13;
      the "Estonia" matter came together with the President, Andi Meister, Enn &#13;
      Neidre and the then Prime Minister by military plane to Turku on 28 or 29.09.94 &#13;
      - probably 28.09.94. The Prime Minister was at first also a member of the &#13;
      Estonian intermediate commission but was subsequently fired, when it turned &#13;
      out that he was a weapons smuggler. Tuomo Karppinen was also in Turku on &#13;
      that day, the first one in the early morning hours had been Kari Lethola.<br/>&#13;
      Note: According to the notes made by prosecutor Birgitta Cronier, then in &#13;
      charge of the ESTONIA case, on the morning of 28 September 1994 "Kari Lethola &#13;
      is already on site in Utö". See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.463.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
      38.5.463.</a></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The co-operation between &#13;
      the part commissions could be better. Each national part of the JAIC was &#13;
      working internally on its subject, the exchange of information/documentation &#13;
      was basically restricted to the meetings. This refers in particular to the &#13;
      Estonians who have produced very little, so far, but also to the Swedes. &#13;
      Börje Stenström is an acknowledged expert in naval architecture, but it &#13;
      seems almost impossible to persuade him of other alternatives once he has &#13;
      made up is mind. He is not a good casualty investigator. They are expecting &#13;
      a lot of problems before the Final Report is agreed upon.<br/>&#13;
      - They know nothing about the working lists where the twisted port hinge &#13;
      of the bow ramp was mentioned repeatedly for repairs.<br/>&#13;
      - This 'Group of Experts' explained to them the connection water in visor &#13;
      / gap in ramp / water on car deck / clothing around the port hinge of the &#13;
      ramp. They were themselves puzzled about the many clothings hanging around &#13;
      that area which could only be explained as the crew plugging the gap in &#13;
      the ramp from time to time when the ramp and visor were closed.<br/>&#13;
      - They will continue to investigate the above circumstances. The probability &#13;
      that the scuppers on the car deck were open was also discussed, that one &#13;
      or several non-return valves were blocked, that pipes leading from scuppers &#13;
      on car deck towards outboard through the 1st deck (deck below car deck) &#13;
      were corroded/leaking and in connection with open non-return valves water &#13;
      penetrated the starboard side of the 1st deck (vessel had a permanent starboard &#13;
      list of 4-5° around which she was rolling probably up to 10° to starboard).<br/>&#13;
      - In the further discussion it became very obvious that they would like &#13;
      to do a much more technical investigation with the fantastic possibilities &#13;
      they have in VTT, however, however this was rejected by the Swedes respectively &#13;
      allowed to a rather limited scope only. <br/>&#13;
      - They were also informed about the repeated invitations of this 'Group &#13;
      of Experts' to the JAIC to come to Hamburg and Papenburg, to talk to the &#13;
      von Tell representative and relevant yard workers, which they did not know &#13;
      at all. Obviously the channel of information between the JAIC and this 'Group &#13;
      of Experts' ended on the private desk of Börje Stenström. The invitation &#13;
      was repeated to them and they promised to consider. <br/>&#13;
      - Kari Lethola promised to try to find the passenger of "SILJA FESTIVAL" &#13;
      who has told the newspaper HELSINGIN SANOMAT (published 29.09.94) that ESTONIA &#13;
      left Tallinn with open visor.<br/>&#13;
      Note: At that time the statement of this passenger had been in the file &#13;
      of Lethola for sometime already. He denied during the following 2 years &#13;
      frequently to know the name, however, when some of his files were finally &#13;
      inspected by members of this 'Group of Experts' in December 1998 the statement &#13;
      was found and copied. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/19.236.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
      19.236.</a><br/>&#13;
      - It was agreed to send them everything in copy which was sent to the Swedish &#13;
      Commission and further on to send them blind covers. <br/>&#13;
      This was the first time for this 'Group of Experts' to get the chance to &#13;
      look at the other side of the coin and make the amazing experience that &#13;
      the relationship between the Finnish and the Swedish parts of the JAIC was &#13;
      not as good as demonstrated to the outside and, in particular, that this &#13;
      was basically due to the behaviour of Börje Stenström. Moreover, that Stenström &#13;
      basically dictated the scope of the technical investigations exclusively &#13;
      in accordance with the hypothetical casualty scenario and the cause considerations &#13;
      developed by him. <br/>&#13;
      Already in December everything which had been submitted in writing to Stenström &#13;
      was sent in copy to the Finnish part of the JAIC and further on they received &#13;
      blind copies of all correspondence. <br/>&#13;
      It was also considered to be remarkable that Stenström had not informed &#13;
      the Finns about the damaged port outer hinge of the bow ramp and the consequentially &#13;
      open part of the bow ramp to the water-filled visor, which, in fact, rendered &#13;
      the ferry initially unseaworthy with the privity of her owners/ tech-nical &#13;
      managers. The Estonian part of the JAIC knowing these circumstances, of &#13;
      course, from their questioning of the relief crew remained silent. It is &#13;
      unknown what the Finns did after having been informed by this 'Group of &#13;
      Experts' about such grave deficiency as the partly open bow ramp being plugged &#13;
      with mattresses, blankets and similar material to avoid the worst - water &#13;
      in large quantities on the car deck - from the always at sea water-filled &#13;
      visor. No official reaction was noted until Karpinnen made himself the laughing &#13;
      stock of the shipping community when he invented the "floating mattresses" &#13;
      during the press conference in which the Final Report was presented. <br/>&#13;
      The total disregard of Börje Stenström for orderly investigation is further &#13;
      demonstrated by the way in which he chose to file documentation he received &#13;
      in his capacity as JAIC member. Instead of having the documents registered &#13;
      in the logbook as provided for by law he kept them unregistered at home. &#13;
      Only after his death in February 1997 were these documents found in his &#13;
      house, and subsequently registered with the small notation "Inh. fr. BS &#13;
      971006 or 970326" meaning "Arrived from Börje Stenström on 06.10.97 or 26.03.97". &#13;
      This should of course also have been done with the repair lists of ESTONIA &#13;
      on which the repair request for the damaged port outer hinge of the bow &#13;
      ramp was made, however these lists were never registered.<br/>&#13;
      Note: The alleged "List of maintenance and repair works on M.V. 'Estonia': &#13;
      April 1993 - August 1994" - attached as Supplement 230 - just contains the &#13;
      engine and electrical part - deck is not mentioned. Moreover this "List" &#13;
      was received by the Swedish JAIC from N&amp;T only on 31.10.97 - five weeks &#13;

      The year 1995 ended with a letter from Börje Stenström dated 22 December &#13;
      by which he asked in total 11 questions with regard to the contents of the &#13;
      memo this 'Group of Experts' had handed over at the November meeting - the &#13;
      letter is attached as Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.464.htm" target="_blank">38.5.464 &#13;
      </a>and shall be commented on in connection with the reply dated 22 January &#13;

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>39.4<br/>&#13;
    The Survivors' Statements </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">As stated before, the non-classified &#13;
    statements were copied from the files of the Swedish JAIC in January/February &#13;
    and sent in bundles to Hamburg. All statements were in the Swedish language, &#13;
    i.e. the original Finnish and Estonian statements were already translated &#13;
    into Swedish. See also Subchapter 36.5.<br/>&#13;
    It took almost 3 months to analyse and evaluate the statements. The result &#13;
    was astonishing as the hypothetical sequence-of-events of the JAIC did not &#13;
    at all match with the statements of the survivors. It follows that the JAIC &#13;
    had disregarded the passengers' statements and just relied on the testimonies &#13;
    of the crew members, in particular, of Silver Linde and Margus Treu. <br/>&#13;
    Note: Chapter 21.2 demonstrates the "reliability" of these statements. <br/>&#13;
    The summary and evaluation of all statements, the changed sequence-of-events &#13;
    and cause consideration as well as the conclusions resulting therefrom were &#13;
    submitted - together with a summary of the technical findings in a 87-page &#13;
    letter dated 22 July 1996 to Börje Stenström with copy to the Finnish part &#13;
    of the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
    Stenström wrote a few comments by the letter of 30 September, however, the &#13;
    Finnish part of JAIC never did reply to this letter. The letter is attached &#13;
    as Enclosure 39.4.471. It was classified by the Swedish part of the JAIC on &#13;
    02.08.96 and declassified again on 06.03.98 - 14 months after the publication &#13;
    of the Final JAIC Report. </font></p>&#13;

  <p align="center"> <b><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">39.5<br/>&#13;
    Communication and Investigation as from April 1996 </font></b></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: Since the beginning &#13;
    of 1996 the Finnish Environment Agency was preparing the removal of the fuel &#13;
    oil from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA. This should be carried out by sophisticated &#13;
    ROVs, able to cut holes into the vessel's side. The heavy fuel should then &#13;
    be heated and sucked out by means of equipment which could, however, only &#13;
    be used up to wind force 3-4 Bft. As this meant that there would be quite &#13;
    some idle time at sea for the vessel "HALLI" from board of which the ROV was &#13;
    operated, Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish part of the JAIC &#13;
    took the chance to stay onboard at those idle times and used the ROV for examinations &#13;
    of interesting parts of the wreck. See Chapter 28. This 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    was kept closely informed and even asked what they wanted to have examined. &#13;
    Thus a fax with various points of interest was sent to Tuomo Karppinen on &#13;
    18 April - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.472.htm" target="_blank">39.5.472</a>. &#13;
    Tuomo Karppinen also wrote down in a memo which items the Finnish part of &#13;
    the JAIC would like to have examined and as it is revealed from the memo that &#13;
    their requirements went much farther than those of this 'Group of Experts'. &#13;
    Also Börje Stenström wanted more and better pictures from the wreck when he &#13;
    wrote by fax of 15 April to Tuomo Karppinen: <br/>&#13;
    "re: Pictures from 'Estonia'. <br/>&#13;
    After some consideration I can still see the necessity for us to try to get &#13;
    better pictures from the damage to the deck and the front bulkheads, inclusive &#13;
    of pictures through the holes in the vessel. Furthermore, close-ups of the &#13;
    electric cables to the sensors of the bottom lock, in particular the free &#13;
    ends and the backside of the plate to which the sensors had been mounted."" &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.474.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    39.5.474. </a></font></p>&#13;
  <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">He should have remembered &#13;
    that the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables had been cut off in &#13;
    his presence by the divers in December 1994 - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;
    27</a> - and thrown away. <br/>&#13;
    Since it was one of the really urgent requirements of this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    to have an own look at the wreck the Finnish part of the JAIC was requested &#13;
    to permit a member of this 'Group of Experts' to attend one of the planned &#13;
    ROV surveys. This was however at once and categorically rejected. Nevertheless &#13;
    Karppinen and Rahka kept reporting on these ROV inspections, for example Karppinen &#13;
    on 29 April: <br/>&#13;
    "The water was so dirty that the ROV operators refused to put their equipment &#13;
    into the water in order not to endanger it. All the time the Norwegian M.V. &#13;
    "TERTNES" was dropping sand and rocks into the water only 100 m away from &#13;
    the wreck, therefore the visibility was zero. "TERTNES" left on Sunday and &#13;
    will return only in June. They will make another attempt by ROV next weekend. &#13;
    So far they have searched the whole wreck except for the extreme aft and found &#13;
    nothing - no hole cut into the side."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Börje Stenström, whose &#13;
    health was continuously deteriorating, complained bitterly about the Estonians &#13;
    who still had not delivered anything, thus the Swedes had practically taken &#13;
    over everything from them. Enn Neidre was replaced by Pritt Mänik. He stated, &#13;
    that they had accepted our letter of 22.01.96, also the plugging of the bow &#13;
    ramp by the crew and it will be included into their report. He was aware of &#13;
    the fact that the Estonian witnesses were lying to them and did not tell the &#13;
    full story, however, "What can we do?" <br/>&#13;
    Note: They should have listened to the surviving passengers. <br/>&#13;
    He did not read the Hellberg book, but others in the Commission have and feel &#13;
    that the yard is "treated quite well". When the gap in the bow ramp was further &#13;
    discussed, it turned out that the gap was now apparently an admitted fact. &#13;
    Stenström also spoke about the interlock between visor and bow ramp and it &#13;
    turned out that he believed that the visor could only be closed if the bow &#13;
    ramp was properly closed and locked. He was informed that the visor could &#13;
    be almost closed (for painting purposes) if the bow ramp was fully open. Also &#13;
    the water in the visor and on car deck was discussed and the passenger video. &#13;
    Stenström was informed in detail about the missing material at the starboard &#13;
    hinge compared to the port hinge. Stenström further informed that their report &#13;
    was still not ready and that they would send the draft to N&amp;T, ESCO, B.V. &#13;
    and the yard before it would be finalized so that all parties involved would &#13;
    have a last chance to comment on their respective parts. Stenström further &#13;
    advised that they believed to have enough evidence to evaluate their case, &#13;
    but if any diving on the wreck would be done they would certainly want to &#13;
    examine certain things. Compared to the Part-Report they had "softened" the &#13;
    Final Report not to put more or too much blame on the yard. They did not get &#13;
    the information about the officers from the Estonians which they need. They &#13;
    cannot even blame them for the speed. He will send the draft report next week. &#13;
    Margus Treu has said that the watertight doors were open. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">June: During a telephone &#13;
    conversation on the 5th Klaus Rahka advised that he would go out by tug to &#13;
    M.V. "HALLI" tonight, to attend another ROV inspection of the wreck. They &#13;
    had a meeting of the technical group, i.e. B. Stenström, T. Karppinen, Metsaveer &#13;
    and Ingerma, M. Huss and himself. The atmosphere was quite relaxed and it &#13;
    seems that they do accept a break load of 175 ts for the side locks now. <br/>&#13;
    Subsequently Rahka wrote as follows:<br/>&#13;
    "With respect to doing a test including weaker than actual weldments we seem &#13;
    to share an interest toward a test, because that would be the only practical &#13;
    way to find the magnitude of an extreme minimum strength of a lock of this &#13;
    general configuration. As it is now - estimates of minimum strength have only &#13;
    been made analytically, and we see a strong chance that these estimates inevitably &#13;
    produce low values for the strength estimates. The forepeak structure is high &#13;
    quality FE 37-type steel, which thanks to its high ductility could work to &#13;
    even out loads between the three lugs, thus raising the result above that &#13;
    obtainable by calculation only. Technically it would thus be valuable to determine &#13;
    the behaviour of such a structure, because the assumptions underlying the &#13;
    analytical calculations most likely underestimate load sharing between the &#13;
    three lugs. An experiment would be the only reliable way to find how much &#13;
    this technical minimum is larger than the analytical estimate." <br/>&#13;
    Such a test was subsequently also carried out and for details see Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    34.3</a> and 39.2. The complete fax is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.475.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    39.5.475</a>. <br/>&#13;
    On 8 June SVENSKA DAGBLADET published an interview with Olof Forssberg of &#13;
    which some parts are quoted below: <br/>&#13;
    "There is no guarantee that the Commission's report will be completed by the &#13;
    2nd anniversary of the casualty. This was said by Olof Forssberg, chairman &#13;
    of the Swedish part of the International Commission.<br/>&#13;
    The delay of the report is a disappointment for many relatives. On the 2nd &#13;
    anniversary the liability of the owners for the casualty becomes time barred &#13;
    and the relatives had stated that they need the report of the Commission to &#13;
    sue the owners. <br/>&#13;
    It cannot wait </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">F: As there is a time-bar &#13;
    period of 2 years the relatives cannot sit and wait for our report. They have &#13;
    to commence legal proceedings on basis of own material, said Olof Forssberg. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    SvD: Why is the report so much delayed? From the beginning it ha been said &#13;
    that it should come out 1 year after the catastrophe. Now it is uncertain &#13;
    whether it will be ready on the 2nd anniversary.<br/>&#13;
    F: It has to be borne in mind that we here in Sweden cannot do everything &#13;
    in the commission. This is actually an International Commission with an Estonian &#13;
    chairmanship. <br/>&#13;
    F: There are always difficulties if one is working in a commission with leaders &#13;
    from 3 different nations and if one is an own national commission. There is &#13;
    hardly a subject which due to the language does not lead to delays and complications. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    Discussions about selection of words<br/>&#13;
    F: The text is read and everybody has to agree, and that takes time. Always &#13;
    discussions remain about the selection of particular words, in particular &#13;
    in the judgement of people and people's behaviour, i.e. that the words have &#13;
    to be chosen very carefully.<br/>&#13;
    SvD: It has been said that the delay is due to disagreement within the commission? &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    F: This I deny categorically. <br/>&#13;
    SvD: Is there agreement between the delegates of Estonia, Sweden and Finland? &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    F: In case we do not agree, we are writing our different opinions. Because &#13;
    majority decisions are not allowed, we have to reserve our rights. <br/>&#13;
    SvD: About a year ago the commission submitted a part-report concerning the &#13;
    technical aspects of the casualty only. The behaviour of the crew shall be &#13;
    dealt with only in the final report.<br/>&#13;
    Olof Forssberg is today neither confirming nor denying information concerning &#13;
    missing initiative of the Estonian crew.<br/>&#13;
    SvD: What is your opinion about the picture of the master as outlined by the &#13;
    journalists Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle in their book about the catastrophe? &#13;
    The master is said to have been authoritarian and incompetent. <br/>&#13;
    F: Talks with pilots show a different picture. There is much different information &#13;
    about the master.<br/>&#13;
    SvD: When 'Estonia' got the list, however, the master choose to turn to port &#13;
    which increased the list?<br/>&#13;
    F: Theoretically, it would have been better to turn to the other side. It &#13;
    is, however, not so easy just to say that the master turned to the wrong side. &#13;
    It is often so that in case of a list this side is turned into the sea, exactly &#13;
    as the master did.<br/>&#13;
    Bad Repairs<br/>&#13;
    SvD: The yard which built the 'Estonia' is alleging that N&amp;T neglected the &#13;
    condition of the vessel and postponed necessary repairs. Can you reject this &#13;
    allegations?<br/>&#13;
    F: We shall comment on this in our final report, said O. Forssberg and added &#13;
    that the German yard has "a number of theories at the present time". He pointed &#13;
    out that the yard e.g. was interested in a Russian report which alleges that &#13;
    the casualty was a result of the ferry having been used as a smuggle ship. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    SvD: Do you mean that the yard is looking for any straw to find an explanation &#13;
    which would release her from liability?<br/>&#13;
    F: We get the impression that they are trying to do that. <br/>&#13;
    SvD: How was it to investigate the largest civil casualty in Europe in modern &#13;
    times? <br/>&#13;
    F: - Many times people are of the opinion that because so many have lost their &#13;
    lives there must be a rather complicated cause for the casualty. There can, &#13;
    however, be a rather banal accident even if the consequences are disastrous.<br/>&#13;
    - It is easy to conclude that a lot of people must also have made a lot of &#13;
    mistakes. Sometimes however life is quite simple such as that an accident &#13;
    occurs. <br/>&#13;
    SvD: Will the theories and speculations come to an end once your final report &#13;
    is submitted?<br/>&#13;
    F: No, because we have no access to the wreck the rumours will continue to &#13;
    live. This was the same with the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg, Dag Hammarsköld's &#13;
    air plane casualty and the murder of Olof Palme - theories are coming and &#13;
    emerging in uniform distances." <br/>&#13;
    The complete article is attached as Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.476.htm" target="_blank">39.5.476.</a> &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 13 June Klaus Rahka informed &#13;
    that the ROV inspection of the wreck had brought nothing. It might be repeated &#13;
    but Kari Lethola wants a diving investi-gation. Finnish divers had made an &#13;
    offer already and one diver can work on site for about 20 minutes. One job &#13;
    will be to closely film the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables of &#13;
    the Atlantic lock sensors, however the wish list of this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    would also be favourably considered. Rahka was informed that his proposal &#13;
    to make a further break test with tack-welds had been accepted and the test &#13;
    was already being prepared. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">July: In early July the evaluation &#13;
    of the many statements of the survivors was completed and based on the noise &#13;
    and time scenarios revealed from these statements, a new casualty scenario &#13;
    was developed which differed considerably from that of the JAIC. The present &#13;
    stage of the technical investigation by this 'Group of Experts' including &#13;
    the interpretation of the passenger video, the summaries and evaluations of &#13;
    all survivor statements and the consequently newly developed casualty scenario &#13;
    and cause consideration were - as stated before - submitted to Stenström with &#13;
    copies to the Finnish JAIC. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.4.471.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    39.4.471.</a> <br/>&#13;
    While in the Swedish and Estonian media a squabble was carried out between &#13;
    Andi Meister/Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg and other Swedish JAIC members and &#13;
    experts, the rumours that Andi Meister would resign from the JAIC were growing &#13;
    and, indeed, on 30 July he resigned. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström commented &#13;
    this as follows: </font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi Meister was already &#13;
    very tired at the last meeting and had indicated that he was considering to &#13;
    retire. They believe that the Estonian complaints about the Swedes withholding &#13;
    evidence was just an excuse to create a break in the commission which, however, &#13;
    would not be permitted by the politicians on both sides. The Estonians were &#13;
    apparently under growing internal pressure to avoid what becomes more and &#13;
    more obvious viz. that the main blame lies with the management and crew and &#13;
    that the evidence given by the Estonian crew members is wrong. Stenström further &#13;
    said, that he had a lot of material at home which was not even registered. &#13;
    See also <a href="chapter35.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 35.7</a>. He declared &#13;
    not to have the repair list for the bow ramp damage. He was told by chief &#13;
    engineer H. Moosaar (of the 2nd crew), Hobro and Rasmusson that the copy remained &#13;
    onboard. That was clear, however, where was the original? No reply. </font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">August: The diver videos &#13;
    and three amateur videos were received, viewed and evaluated which took time &#13;
    and the further development and discussion of the new casualty scenario took &#13;
    even more time. Sweden and Finland were on vacation. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">September: On 5 September &#13;
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' met with the Finnish part of the JAIC &#13;
    in Helsinki when a copy of the passenger video was handed over - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    39.3 </a>- and all subjects were discussed. It turned out that the JAIC trusted &#13;
    the model test results of SSPA more than the reports of the survivors and, &#13;
    further, maintained their initial findings and casualty scenario in spite &#13;
    of all the contradictory evidence submitted to them by this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    and others. The results of the meeting are summarized in a memo and because &#13;
    this was the last meeting with the JAIC the conclusions shall be quoted a &#13;
    follows: <br/><i>"Tuomo Karppinen, who is obviously in overall charge of the evaluation &#13;
    of statements, is very uncertain and unsure. He was apparently following instructions &#13;
    when submitting the scenario explained under 1.8. without creating the impression &#13;
    of being entirely convinced himself. In addition, he obviously has not yet &#13;
    carried out a detailed evaluation of the statements, which is really necessary &#13;
    to understand the full background. The obvious fact that his nautical experience &#13;
    is limited to some yachting does not make it easier. Consequently, it again &#13;
    has to be concluded that the Commission is still not doing the required work &#13;
    as it has to be and can be expected with a case of this dimension. It is not &#13;
    enough to explain all indications of an early starboard list with "but the &#13;
    seas continued to strike from port side until the visor fell off."</i><br/>&#13;
    It has to be decided now whether we shall spend some more time in explaining &#13;
    to them in more detail why the starboard list must have occurred much earlier, &#13;
    etc. The next Commission meeting is at the end of September. They will under &#13;
    all circumstances complete their report before Christmas, even if it should &#13;
    not contain the latest stage of the investigation. The pressure from government &#13;
    side is said to be very severe." <br/>&#13;
    By letter of 30 September Börje Stenström commented on some of the issues &#13;
    raised in the letter of this 'Group of Experts' but no word abut the survivors' &#13;
    statements and the resulting new casualty scenario. <br/>&#13;
    Since 24 September Uno Laur was the chairman of the JAIC. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">October: The exchange of &#13;
    information by fax and telephone between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    continued and some time was spent with the discussion of the statements of &#13;
    ex-boatswain Luttunen, who testified that the three lugs of the Atlantic lock &#13;
    on the forepeak deck had been renewed in 1982/83, most probably by von Tell &#13;
    AB, Gothenburg. The JAIC did not accept the statement of Luttunen, because &#13;
    it was not confirmed by other crew members having been onboard with him. It &#13;
    led, however, to an analysis of the paint layers of the starboard lug and &#13;
    the visor lug which revealed that the basic primer of the starboard lug was &#13;
    grey and of the visor lug was yellow. As the basic primer of the foreship &#13;
    at the newbuilding stage had been yellow, this analysis result confirms the &#13;
    Luttunen statement, but even despite such improved knowledge the statement &#13;
    was still disregarded by the JAIC.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> November: The JAIC had a &#13;
    commission meeting for three days in Stockholm from 19-21 November at which &#13;
    24 persons attended, among them Enn Neidre - who as the reader will recall &#13;
    - had officially resigned from the JAIC. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.477.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    39.5.477</a> - List of Attendants. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">December: Following the above-mentioned &#13;
    meeting various JAIC members and experts made different statements to the &#13;
    media, and the yard was again attacked. Soon thereafter Börje Stenström wrote &#13;
    an apologetic fax to Dr. Holtappels, which is quoted as follows: <br/>&#13;
    "You will no doubt learn through your press monitoring about what was going &#13;
    on in Stockholm during the past days. A radio channel reporter had talked &#13;
    to an outside expert, getting the impression that there were additional facts &#13;
    about the locking mechanisms beyond what is mentioned in the Part-Report. &#13;
    This led to activities in several other media including two TV channels by &#13;
    which I have been interviewed. I stated repeatedly in the interviews that &#13;
    we do not point out who installed the lock attachments of their current dimensions. &#13;
    Unfortunately this was now picked up in only one of the broadcasts, but rather &#13;
    an impression that it was now more clear than before that the yard had installed &#13;
    undersized lockings. <br/>&#13;
    Lawyer Witte was also interviewed and claimed quickly that chances to sue &#13;
    the yard will now increase. I will call Witte Tuesday morning to explain to &#13;
    him that his conclusions are not based on facts of our report, on the contrary &#13;
    we will remain silent on the issue of who may have installed the weak parts." &#13;

    Changes in the JAIC</b> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Estonian chairman Andi &#13;
    Meister resigned on 30.07.96. The chairmanship had been offered to Kari Lethola &#13;
    and to Olof Forssberg, however, was rejected by both of them as the Prime &#13;
    Ministers of Estonia, Finland and Sweden had decided on 28 September 1994 &#13;
    that the chairman should be Estonian. Only in the course of September did &#13;
    Uno Laur accept the appointment and took over the chair on 24 September. Already &#13;
    on 30.07.96, the day of Andi Meister's resignation, Heino Jaakula - from the &#13;
    Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.) - was appointed as member. <br/>&#13;
    In April Enn Neidre had already resigned from the JAIC upon pressure from &#13;
    Sweden and Finland caused by the remarks of Dr. Holtappels (see Chapter 38.4). &#13;
    As stated above Neidre was replaced by Pritt Männik, but remained an expert &#13;
    to the Estonian JAIC and participated in this capacity full scale in the JAIC &#13;
    work including the drafting of the Final Report. The initial judgement that &#13;
    the JAIC was biased due to its Estonian members remains upheld. <br/>&#13;
    The Finnish expert Simo Aarnio passed away on 22.01.96 and was replaced by &#13;
    Kari Larjo on 27.02.96. <br/>&#13;
    There were considerably more changes to come which will be explained in the &#13;
    following chapter 40.</font></p>&#13;

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.3<br/>&#13;
    The Development from July to December</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>July: </b>In the meantime &#13;
    the "WASA KING" specification dated 25.09.92 which had been received at the &#13;
    exhibition from the Turku Repair Yard - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    3.4.96</a> - had been translated and evaluated. See <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    3.4</a> - when Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 1 July and reported the following:<br/>&#13;
    - He would finish the Report in two weeks, then everything would be in the &#13;
    printing house and the printing would start.<br/>&#13;
    - The result would be the 1st draft which would then be sent to all members &#13;
    and experts for comments to be delivered by mid August. The enclosures would &#13;
    be in a separate supplement of about 500 pages.<br/>&#13;
    - After printing of the final version the Report would be published circa &#13;
    mid to end September.<br/>&#13;
    - A new Swedish Commission would be formed to investigate everything the Swedish &#13;
    Government did or did not in connection with the ESTONIA; <br/>&#13;
    - Karppinen was then asked whether he knew about the repair specification &#13;
    dated 25.09.92 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    3.4.96</a> - which he confirmed and further advised that he had spoken with &#13;
    Tuomo Mäkki about it, who had made an offer for the bow ramp hinges but not &#13;
    for the visor locking devices.<br/>&#13;
    Note: This is true. Behind the respective item is a handwritten note: "Price &#13;
    to be quoted after visual inspection." Apparently Mäkki never inspected the &#13;
    locking devices visually because in the meantime it had been decided to sell &#13;
    the vessel and only those items were repaired by the sellers which had to &#13;
    be rectified according to the sales contract. <br/>&#13;
    Karppinen further explained that he had also spoken to the last Finnish inspector, &#13;
    Charles Richardson from Wasa Line, who had told him that at the time the specification &#13;
    was made up by the crew they did not know that the vessel would be sold.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Next the possibility that &#13;
    the Atlantic lock had been changed after newbuilding was discussed and Karppinen &#13;
    said that there was a small chance because the basic primer of the visor lug &#13;
    was found to be yellow but on the starboard lug grey. <br/>&#13;
    Note: Actually the basic primer of all lugs had been yellow at newbuilding &#13;
    - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 2.4.6</a> and<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.4.6.63.</a> <br/>&#13;
    - Finally Karppinen advised that it had been decided that this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    would receive no parts whatsoever from the JAIC Report before the publication.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>August:</b> On 13 August &#13;
    Tuomo Karppinen advised on the following:<br/>&#13;
    - The draft version of their Report had now been distributed to the members &#13;
    and experts except for three chapters which are still missing. <br/>&#13;
    - He expects amendments, because after all delegations have read through the &#13;
    draft he is certain that not everybody will agree. - Amendments are sent to &#13;
    him and he incorporates them into the existing text. <br/>&#13;
    - They still hope to publish around the 3rd anniversary. <br/>&#13;
    On 15 August the Swedish JAIC had a working meeting in Stockholm. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>September:</b> From 3 &#13;
    to 5 September the Swedish JAIC went again through the text of the Report &#13;
    and apparently concluded the matter. During this meeting it came to a clash &#13;
    of different opinions which led to the resignation of the psychological expert &#13;
    Bengt Schager three days later on 8 September. In a subsequent interview by &#13;
    Jutta Rabe, Bengt Schager did explain the situation as follows:<br/><i>"BS: It was a meeting where we should look at the text. I was prepared &#13;
    for that meeting because as I figured out, it was the last chance to alter &#13;
    some of the details in a favourable way as I regard it is the truth. I was &#13;
    very well prepared and got the message that this meeting would only deal with &#13;
    the language problems and such things and that the report should be printed &#13;
    even though not all the chapters were ready, I didn't think that this was &#13;
    a proper way of working with it and then I told them that I would resign and, &#13;
    also I might mention, before that, when Olof Forssberg was the Swedish chairman, &#13;
    he was in favour for the opportunity for me of having a special opinion also &#13;
    printed into the report and then, later on, I understood that Mr. Laur would &#13;
    never allow a special opinion from me printed in the report. This, together &#13;
    with the rush in timing was the basis for my decision, and the long frustration &#13;
    also. <br/>&#13;
    Q: But you emphasize just at this moment that their truth and your truth, &#13;
    so there is a difference between your truth and their truth? <br/>&#13;
    A: There is a discrepancy and, of course, I believe that I am right, but I &#13;
    don't know and that's why I would like to be revealed my thinking when the &#13;
    report is there, so that everyone who is reading the report and listening &#13;
    to me, or, perhaps is reading what I am writing at that time and can see for &#13;
    themselves and judge, because when you are one against 20 you have some difficulties &#13;
    with, you have consequences with your relations, with the rest of them, and &#13;
    arguing for something, when you have 20 against you, of which 10 are silent &#13;
    but hostile and 10 are arguing against you, you have a friend at your side &#13;
    frequently saying: "Bengt, stop, for heaven's sake, stop," then you may come &#13;
    to a point, where you are really questioning yourself. Then, after a while, &#13;
    you have to continue because you are believing in a certain thing and the &#13;
    rest of them could not really give me good arguments. So, then you have to &#13;
    continue, in a way. Even though, of course, it makes you sometimes a little &#13;
    bit uncertain whether you really have right or not." </i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 18 September Tuomo Karppinen &#13;
    started during a telephone conversation: <br/>&#13;
    - He received the comments/corrections from members and experts on Monday, &#13;
    8 September, and has given the corrections to the printing house this Monday, &#13;
    15 September.<br/></font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - He will receive &#13;
    three printed copies in about two weeks which will then be read through again &#13;
    by the English language expert and himself at least twice.<br/>&#13;
    - Then the final version goes to the printing house and then it takes 4-5 &#13;
    weeks, i.e. publication mid to end November. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 22 September during a &#13;
    further telephone conversation Tuomo Karppinen said that they will have another &#13;
    full commission meeting in Tallinn due to unexpected difficulties with the &#13;
    text and only thereafter the final corrections can be made and printing started, &#13;
    i.e. publication early December. <br/>&#13;
    On the same day "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published an ariticle which contained &#13;
    the first interview with Bengt Schager after his resignation and which reads &#13;
    - office translated - as follows:<br/><i>"'Estonia' Report is Protecting the Crew. <br/>&#13;
    The 'Estonia' Report is incomplete. The Estonian chairman tries to avoid criticizing &#13;
    the crew and this has disturbed the work of the commission, alleges an expert, &#13;
    who resigned from the investigation. <br/>&#13;
    Turbulent Investigation. <br/>&#13;
    The investigation of the International Commission was accompanied by numerous &#13;
    delays, censorship, accusations, criticism by the Judicial Ombudsman and change &#13;
    of chairmen. <br/>&#13;
    July 1996: The Estonian Chairman Andi Meister resigned after having severely &#13;
    criticized the Swedish part of the Commission. <br/>&#13;
    May 1997: Olof Forssberg, chairman of the Swedish part of the Commission, &#13;
    was forced to resign after having lied to a radio reporter. <br/>&#13;
    "I don't trust the Commission any longer", said Bengt Schager, psychological &#13;
    expert of the 'Estonia' Commission, who resigned from the investigation under &#13;
    protest. Now the 'Estonia' Report, which will be submitted to the printing &#13;
    house shortly, risks loosing much of its credibility. <br/>&#13;
    Bengt Schager is of the opinion that the commission did not properly investigate &#13;
    the safety culture onboard of 'Estonia'. The question was much too sensitive. &#13;
    "There has been a preparedness to talk matters and circumstances unfavourable &#13;
    for the crew to their advantage." </i><br/><i><b>Bad Quality. </b></i><br/>&#13;
    The 'Estonia' Commission is a three-nation commission with experts and members &#13;
    from Estonia, Finland and Sweden. B. Schager means that the work was very &#13;
    much disturbed by the obligation to reach agreement. The Swedes and Finns &#13;
    had frequently considered giving up. <br/><i>"It has been so important to keep the Commission together to avoid that &#13;
    somebody acts on his own initiative"</i>, he said.<br/><i>"I do not believe that the quality of the report is good. You find more &#13;
    lessons to learn from this casualty than is mentioned in the report, there &#13;
    had actually been lots of defects onboard"</i>, said Bengt Schager after almost &#13;
    3 years work.<br/><i><b>Ferry Sentenced to Death.</b></i><br/>&#13;
    Bengt Schager stressed that there is no disagreement inside the Commission &#13;
    about the main cause of the casualty: These were technical defects which sank &#13;
    'Estonia' down into the depth. The large ferry was sentenced to death. This &#13;
    conclusion has never been in dispute. <br/>&#13;
    The question about the acting of the Estonian crew in the very situation has, &#13;
    however, been in dispute the more, Bengt Schager is of the opinion that there &#13;
    are lots of question marks. <br/><i>"There are lots of things which belong into the report but which you cannot &#13;
    find there",</i> he said. B. Schager is critical about the way the report &#13;
    deals with the acting of the crew:<i> "Safety culture was with certainty not &#13;
    at the standard which could be expected". </i><br/>&#13;
    But he means that also other parts are defect. <i>"Certain analysis work was &#13;
    more or less just average work. We should have gone much more into detail &#13;
    and investigated much deeper",</i> he said pointing at the fact that they &#13;
    were practically investigating Europe's largest ferry casualty in modern times. &#13;
    <br/><i><b>Stressed Commission. </b></i><br/>&#13;
    B. Schager sees two reasons why the investigation, according to him, shall &#13;
    remain faulty (imperfect): Certain questions have been sensitive whilst the &#13;
    commission has simultaneously been permanently under stress.<br/>&#13;
    The investigation requirements could not withstand the requirements of the &#13;
    media for a quick completion and, therefore, an incomplete report shall be &#13;
    submitted.<br/>&#13;
    B. Schager means that the Estonia Commission should have permitted herself &#13;
    to investigate the matter properly." <br/>&#13;
    The article is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.3.481.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    40.3.481</a>.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The interview is self-explanatory. &#13;
    It confirms the bad atmosphere inside the JAIC which existed practically from &#13;
    the very beginning, at first due to the dominant behaviour of Börje Stenström, &#13;
    followed by the discrepancies which led to the resignation of Andi Meister &#13;
    and finally due to the attempt of Uno Laur to protect Estonian interests.<br/>&#13;
    On the 3rd anniversary of the catastrophe "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published a &#13;
    small article under the heading "Investigation of the 'Estonia' Catastrophe" &#13;
    which reads - office translated - as follows: <br/><i><b>"Criminal Violation of the Maritime Law and/or Causing Other Persons' &#13;
    Death" </b></i>is the heading under which the Criminal Police is investigating &#13;
    the 'Estonia' catastrophe going on parallel with the investigation of the &#13;
    International Commission. In addition to survivors' statements the police &#13;
    and the chief prosecutor have among other things interrogated representatives &#13;
    of N&amp;T, who had the technical responsibility for the vessel and of the classification &#13;
    society B.V. who approved vessel's construction and condition. "Some further &#13;
    interro-gations are pending", said chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, who &#13;
    is leading the inquiry. The purpose of the inquiry is to find out it somebody &#13;
    will have to be prosecuted for the 'Estonia' catastrophe." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>October:</b> On 17 October &#13;
    Tuomo Karppinen reported as follows: <br/>&#13;
    - The report was changed at the recent meeting and, as a matter of fact, they &#13;
    are still discussing details.<br/>&#13;
    - Next week the English language expert will come again for two days and check &#13;
    the report whereafter it will go to the printing house.<br/>&#13;
    - He estimates that it will take several weeks before the final version is &#13;
    printed and they would be happy if the publication could take place before &#13;
    the end of the year because this is what the politicians are demanding from &#13;
    them. <br/>&#13;
    - He said further that they were aware that "REGINA BALTICA" is either "VIKING &#13;
    SAGA" or "VIKING SONG", but they did not look into the "NORD ESTONIA" matter &#13;
    and they also had not realised that Ulf Hobro had been employed with Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    as safety inspector before he joined N&amp;T.<br/>&#13;
    On 20 October Tuomo Karppinen reported more details:<br/>&#13;
    - They have had a meeting in Helsinki with Ann-Louise Eksborg and Uno Laur &#13;
    attending when the report and some minor changes were finally discussed. Casualty &#13;
    scenario and cause considerations remained unchanged. The report is now finalised.<br/>&#13;
    - Commencing tomorrow he will go through the changes together with their English &#13;
    language expert Bing Crossfield from London, which might take two or three &#13;
    days.<br/>&#13;
    - Thereafter the changes will be worked into the existing manuscript by the &#13;
    printers and a further manuscript will be printed, which he hopes to receive &#13;
    around 26/27 October.<br/>&#13;
    - He will then go through the complete manuscript once again and hopes to &#13;
    be able to submit the final version by the beginning of November, i.e. week &#13;
    45, to the printers who will then commence printing 5000 copies, which will &#13;
    hopefully be completed in week 49.<br/>&#13;
    - This means that the report will be published either in week 49 or 50. The &#13;
    exact date will be fixed as soon as printing has started. <br/>&#13;
    - Since the summer, i.e. after the exhibition of this 'Group of Experts', &#13;
    they have included a new chapter into their report which concerns the "upper &#13;
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck" and have &#13;
    tried to find an explanation for the attitudes of Sjöfartsverket and Finska &#13;
    Sjöfartstyrelse.<br/>&#13;
    Thereafter it was decided to have an up-date exhibition in Stockholm during &#13;
    the time of publication of the JAIC Report and the preparations commenced &#13;
    straight away. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>November:</b> In the early &#13;
    days the Swedish TV 2 program "STRIPTEASE" showed the second part of their &#13;
    "Estonia" investigation. It was apparent that the "STRIPTEASE" journalists &#13;
    had a copy of the Final JAIC Report or one of the drafts of it, which they &#13;
    had submitted to Prof. Vassalous of the West Clyde University, Glasgow, one &#13;
    of the leading naval architects in the UK. Vassalous was asked to give an &#13;
    opinion on the technical part and the conclusions, which he did.<br/>&#13;
    The JAIC had concluded: <br/>&#13;
    "The casualty sequence may have started around 00.55 hours when an A.B. seaman &#13;
    heard a metallic bang behind bow ramp. Locks and hinges broke completely through &#13;
    one or two heavy waves just after 01.00 hours. Consequence: The locks were &#13;
    too weak. 'Estonia' had met similar wave conditions only once or twice earlier &#13;
    between Tallinn and Stockholm. The accident occurred under conditions that &#13;
    were probably the worst she had ever encountered. The casualty has no pre-history, &#13;
    everything happened in one sequence and very quickly."<br/>&#13;
    " Vassalous commented: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"To reach ultimate loads &#13;
      at sea so that the components could fail in one or two loads is highly unlikely &#13;
      . Most components that fail at sea do so because of fatigue, there must &#13;
      have been a pre-history. Therefore the cause for the failures has to be &#13;
      found in the condition of the ship, and especially of the visor."</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>" The professor did not &#13;
    accept that the visor was really completely o.k. on the casualty night nor &#13;
    did he accept that the conditions were unique. He stated that cyclic loading &#13;
    is the nature of any structure, failure caused by fatigue loading is "a fact &#13;
    of marine life". </i><br/>&#13;
    Failure to use common sense by the JAIC was his conclusion. <br/>&#13;
    More uncertainty came up when the General Director of the E.N.M.B. and Estonian &#13;
    observer in the JAIC, Kalle Pedak, and the head of the Maritime Division (Department) &#13;
    of the E.N.M.B., Aarne Valgma, went public by giving an interview to the Baltic &#13;
    News Service about the circumstances surrounding the diving investigation &#13;
    of the ESTONIA in December 1994 when only Aarne Valgma had represented the &#13;
    Estonian side. <br/>&#13;
    The following is quoted from BNS message: <br/>&#13;
    "The divers' mission, which lasted for 64 hours, was filmed and the video &#13;
    picture was continuously forwarded to the support vessel. The Swedish Maritime &#13;
    Administration, which had commissioned the mission, supervised it from aboard &#13;
    the same ship, and also the Swedish criminal police observed the course of &#13;
    the mission there.<br/>&#13;
    Valgma said that during the 64-hour mission there were moments when there &#13;
    was no video picture on his monitor. <br/>&#13;
    "All I can presume is that the diving work was not filmed during those breaks." &#13;
    Valgma told BNS on Thursday. Maritime Department general director Kalle Pedak &#13;
    said it was not very likely there were breaks in the video recording during &#13;
    the divers' mission. <br/><i>"Valgma had admitted that at intervals he saw no video picture in his monitor &#13;
    room and had no access to the ship's main monitor"</i>, Pedak told BNS.<i> &#13;
    "I believe there was a video picture on the main monitor all the time, because &#13;
    the divers were constantly watched".</i><br/>&#13;
    Pedak and Valgma didn't want to comment on why the video picture was interrupted &#13;
    on the Estonian observer's monitor."" <br/>&#13;
    The complete wording of the message is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.3.482.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    40.3.482</a>.<br/>&#13;
    On 17 November the following message was received from the JAIC:<br/>&#13;
    "Re: Press conference concerning the presentation of the Final Report of MV &#13;
    'Estonia' <br/>&#13;
    The Joint Estonian, Finnish and Swedish Commission to investigate the 'Estonia' &#13;
    catastrophe presents its Final Report on 3rd December. The Commission meets &#13;
    in Tallinn to present the Report jointly at 12.00 hours. Simultaneously the &#13;
    Report is submitted to the Swedish and Finnish Governments. A press conference &#13;
    shall be held in Estonia as follows:<br/>&#13;
    Date : Wednesday, 3rd December 1997<br/>&#13;
    Time : 13.00 hours <br/>&#13;

    The Report, which is in English, can be simultaneously picked up, i.e. at &#13;
    the BoA/Stockholm at 11.00 hours and at the BoA/Helsinki at 12.00 hours." &#13;
    T<br/>&#13;
    his was the end of the communication between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' &#13;

    due to faulty design, etc.;<br/>&#13;
    (b) the fact that such an Exhibition was the only possibility of proving quickly &#13;
    and convincingly to the national and international media as well as to the &#13;
    Swedish public that the above-mentioned conclusions were wrong;<br/>&#13;
    (c) the frequently stated wish of many visitors to the 1st Exhibition to come &#13;
    back and give them the chance of comparing the findings of the JAIC with the &#13;
    findings of the German 'Group of Experts' after the Final Report had been &#13;
    published. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Preparations</b> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Based on the experience with &#13;
    the 1st Exhibition it was decided to organise everything in close cooperation &#13;
    with the two relative organisations SEA and DIS and moreover to invite them &#13;
    to perform the exhibition jointly with this 'Group of Experts' and participate &#13;
    actively in the day-to-day preparations. This was welcomed by both organisations. &#13;
    Whilst SEA offered the assistance of their vice chairman Odd Lundkvist, who &#13;
    had been a conference/exhibition manager before his retirement, DIS offered &#13;
    the services of their technical expert Alve Wendt as exhibition guide in order &#13;
    to help this 'Group of Experts' with the many visitors to be expected. In &#13;
    addition, SEA would show their own little exhibition simultaneously. The SEA &#13;
    exhibition would draw attention to the crucial mistakes made by the Swedish &#13;
    government in the handling of the ESTONIA affair. DIS wanted to put up some &#13;
    screens whereupon they would outline what they thought were the real causes &#13;
    for the disaster and who had done what wrong.<br/>&#13;
    When it was definite that the Final Report would be published on 3 December, &#13;
    1997 in Tallinn and copies could be picked up simultaneously in the JAIC offices &#13;
    in Helsinki and Stockholm the following arrangements were made: <br/>&#13;
    - advertisements should appear on 29/30 November, on 1 and 2 December, and &#13;
    again on 8 December<br/>&#13;

    This time no one was invited to the opening nor was there a press conference &#13;
    on the occasion of the opening, nevertheless visitors started streaming in &#13;
    right from the beginning and it can be said that the average number per day &#13;
    was in the range of 200, however, there were days with twice this figure. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    The visitors spent a lot of time with reading, had less questions and thus &#13;
    the stress for the Exhibition guides was much less than previously. <br/>&#13;
    Also the atmosphere this time was different right from the beginning, it was &#13;
    much more relaxed and free of tension, which was certainly to a considerable &#13;
    extent due to the presence of the representatives of the relative organisations, &#13;
    mainly the SEA Exhibition represented by Odd Lundkvist.</font></p>&#13;

    Visitors started to stream in even before the Exhibition was opened at 11.00 &#13;
    hours. The day was full of pre-arranged interviews with German Finnish, Swedish &#13;
    and English TV and radio teams. Nobody from the writing press was spotted. &#13;

    Whilst the chair lady of the Swedish Commission together with the administrator &#13;
    Gunnel Göransson were in Tallinn to attend the ceremony on the next day Lennart &#13;
    Berglund and Odd Lundkvist managed to obtain substantial parts of manuscript &#13;
    of the Final Report and members of this 'Group of Experts' started immediately &#13;
    to analyse the contents. <br/>&#13;
    The chairman of the Association of Swedish Marine Underwriters, Sten Gathenborg, &#13;
    paid a visit to the Exhibition and everything was explained to him. He asked &#13;
    thereafter whether it would be possible to have a private show for the Swedish &#13;
    Marine Underwriters without the public and this was agreed for 9 December, &#13;
    from 08.30 to 11.00 hours. <br/>&#13;
    In the afternoon the Hamburg office phoned and informed that two complete &#13;
    sets of the Final Report of the Commission including supplements had just &#13;
    arrived by courier from Kari Lethola, the chairman of the Finnish JAIC, which &#13;
    meant that almost 24 hours before the official publication the JAIC Report &#13;
    was available to this 'Group of Experts'. The main parts were sent by fax &#13;
    and the analysis commenced at once in order to have some comments already &#13;
    on the following day. <br/>&#13;
    During the evening and parts of the night the Report was analysed as well &#13;
    as possible and already then it became quite obvious that </font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC's scenario was &#13;
    based on the possibility that the vessel could have encountered 1 or 2 heavy &#13;
    waves which could have been able to break to locks of the visor, etc. and &#13;
    </font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">the JAIC had completely &#13;
    ignored the passengers' statements as to time of heel, water on 1st deck and &#13;
    on car deck and</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC had completely &#13;
    ignored the disastrous maintenance condition of visor and bow ramp; but had, &#13;
    to the contrary, found that the vessel had left Tallinn in a completely seaworthy &#13;
    condition, well maintained, manned and loaded. </font> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The conclusions were - &#13;
      as already in the Part-Report from April 1995 - that "the visor attachments &#13;
      were not designed according to realistic design assumptions ..." and "the &#13;
      attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic calculations &#13;
      required", etc. <br/>&#13;
      So not very much had changed during the past 3 years, almost nothing of &#13;
      what this 'Group of Experts' had submitted to the JAIC had been taken into &#13;
      account, it was thus still the Yard and only the Yard on which blame was &#13;
      put. <br/>&#13;
      The defence was prepared straight away by so-called "First Remarks on the &#13;
      Report of the International Commission" of which 400 copies were distributed &#13;
      to visitors until the closing of the Exhibition. One copy is attached as &#13;

      As of 11.00 hours the Report plus Supplements could be picked up by anybody &#13;
      at the office of the Swedish JAIC. <br/>&#13;
      An article appeared in "DAGENS NYHETER" wherein the previous psychology &#13;
      expert Bengt Schager, who had resigned from the JAIC in September, stated &#13;
      that ESTONIA had left Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition referring to the &#13;
      evidence of the Sjöfartsverket inspector Åke Sjöblom, who had left the vessel &#13;
      only shortly before her departure. This led to additional questions from &#13;
      many visitors. <br/>&#13;
      Next, Gerhard Klahn phoned from Ystad in Southern Sweden and stated to have &#13;
      seen a TV interview with the above-mentioned Åke Sjöblom shortly after the &#13;
      casualty during which he had said that they had found the bow ramp in a &#13;
      totally unsatisfactory condition and had strongly recommended to their Estonian &#13;
      colleagues not to permit the ferry to sail in this condition, which, however, &#13;
      was ignored. He was then asked by the journalist what he would have done &#13;
      if he had checked the ESTONIA in a Swedish port? He replied that under absolutely &#13;
      no circumstance would the ferry have left port. </font></p>&#13;

      1997 </b><br/>&#13;
      This was the day of the press conference of this 'Group of Experts' right &#13;
      in the middle of the Exhibition. It began at 11.00 hours with approximately &#13;
      40 journalists and four camera teams attending, many of whom had been in &#13;
      Tallinn the day before. (Reportedly some 200 persons attended the press &#13;
      conference of the JAIC.) Dr. Holtappels submitted the first analysis of &#13;
      the JAIC's Report, drew attention to the obvious mistakes and wrong conclusions, &#13;
      answered numerous questions from partly very insistent journalists who were &#13;
      much better prepared than they had been in June. Simultaneously the survivor &#13;
      from the 1st deck, Carl Övberg, was introduced to the media and told his &#13;
      story and answered questions.<br/>&#13;
      Thereafter it was explained by means of the models that the scenario of &#13;
      the JAIC was not possible to have happened and, as a comparison, this 'Group &#13;
      of Experts' scenario was presented, as supported by the statements of the &#13;
      survivors and other facts. <br/>&#13;
      The two main newspapers in Stockholm reacted as follows: </font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><br/>&#13;
      The Yard is criticised by the Commission. The locks had insufficient dimensions. &#13;
      A drawing illustrates the weak points including the damaged visor and ramp &#13;
      hinges, the gap in the bow ramp, the missing and damaged rubber packings, &#13;
      etc. with detailed explanations.<br/>&#13;
      Also the scenarios of the Commission and of this 'Group of Experts' were &#13;
      illustrated and compared with each other. <br/>&#13;
      Comments from Uno Laur, Dr. Holtappels, Inez Uzman, a speaker for the Ship &#13;
      Owners' Association and Lennart Berglund were quoted. <br/>&#13;
      Mini portraits of Arvo Andresson, Andi Meister, Kent Härstedt, Jan-Tore &#13;

      The reactions to the press conference were: <br/>&#13;
      - in DAGENS NYHETER : Nothing. <br/>&#13;
      - in SVENSKA DAGBLADET : On page 6 a quarter-page article: "The German Yard &#13;
      Criticizes The Report." <br/>&#13;
      - in TT PRESSEN (nationwide): "The Yard does not accept any blame." <br/>&#13;
      - in GÖTEBORG POSTEN: "German Criticism Against The Estonia Report."<br/>&#13;
      "The Yard Is Supported By Sweden." Christer Lindvall, managing director &#13;
      of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' Association, agrees to a certain &#13;
      extent that 'ESTONIA' sank due to poor maintenance and not faulty design &#13;
      or construction by Meyer Werft. <br/>&#13;
      In the morning Lennart Berglund and Anders Lindström, managing director &#13;
      of Sjöfartsverket, were interviewed on Breakfast TV and Lennart Berglund &#13;
      stated to have reliable information that Åke Sjöblom had discovered the &#13;
      damaged bow ramp and tried to stop the ferry. Lindström reacted with obvious &#13;
      shock and said he knew nothing about this, but would certainly investigate &#13;
      it. <br/>&#13;
      This triggered off some press activities which were, however, overshadowed &#13;
      by the new developments in the Palme murder case, which were told to the &#13;
      media in a separate press conference at 10.00 hours. Probably for this reason &#13;
      the press conferences of DIS and SEA at the same time were just attended &#13;
      by one or two journalists.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>6th day - 8 December &#13;

      The Exhibition was reopened at 11.00 hours and the visitors streamed in &#13;
      more than before and the questions were sharper and more precise because &#13;
      all of them had read the comments in the papers, followed the TV and radio &#13;
      comments and sometimes had even studied the JAIC's Report respectively were &#13;
      in the process of doing so and wanted to fill gaps by looking at the Exhibition &#13;
      and asking questions. This was exactly what this 'Group of Experts' had &#13;
      expected. <br/>&#13;
      A number of retired masters, pilots, engineers, divers and even safety inspectors &#13;
      from Sjöfartsverket came and stayed on an average of two hours. Many came &#13;
      again on one of the next days. In addition, people calling from all over &#13;
      the country and also from Finland, offered their knowledge, photos, videos. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      The repair manager of Turku Repair Yard, Arvi Puroya, also visited the exhibition &#13;
      and upon being questioned he stated that <br/>&#13;
      - N&amp;T had not booked any drydocking space for January 1995 for ESTONIA,<br/>&#13;
      - nor had he received any repair specifications. <br/>&#13;
      He also confirmed that the only JAIC member or expert who had ever visited &#13;
      the yard was Tuomo Karppinen. <br/>&#13;
      One of the visiting retired pilots stated that the traffic controller of &#13;
      Sandhamn had told him that he had frequently seen ESTONIA passing on her &#13;
      way out with the visor slightly open. This was mainly during the last weeks &#13;
      before the casualty. <br/>&#13;
      Another visitor said that the weather statements in the JAIC's Report were &#13;
      wrong and "selected". The naval architect Per Fagerlund stated that he had &#13;
      immediately called his friends at SSPA when he heard the nonsense of Karppinen &#13;
      that the speed had had no relevance for the catastrophe and they had strictly &#13;
      rejected to have found anything during their tank tests which would support &#13;
      that and also had made it quite clear that they did not want to be quoted &#13;
      in this connection. <br/>&#13;
      A visitor, who refused to tell his name, stated that he had been working &#13;
      for Stolt and had been on the Stolt diving support vessel "STOLT COMEX", &#13;
      which had been on the ESTONIA position already a few days after the casualty &#13;
      and which Stolt immediately offered to Sjöfartsverket for a diving survey. &#13;
      He said that they had made some tests in the early stages and measured radio &#13;
      activity near the vessel.<br/>&#13;
      In the evening the Swedish JAIC explained their findings and conclusions &#13;
      to the survivors and relatives. Reportedly Mikael Huss said that the Yard &#13;
      had not only miscalculated the loads, but had also used the wrong low quality &#13;
      steel. Ann-Louise Eksborg said that the manual locks were only to be used &#13;
      if the others were out of order. The expert of DIS, Alve Wendt, put the &#13;
      question to Mikael Huss, whether they had considered what would happen to &#13;
      the ramp hinges if the vessel would proceed with fully open ramp and 15 &#13;
      kn speed against head seas? With certainty the hinges would break. M. Huss &#13;
      replied that this had been neither considered nor calculated, although it &#13;
      was part of their scenario. Note: See Subchapter 34.10 - The hinges would &#13;
      break and the ramp fall off. </font></p>&#13;

      He admitted the general responsibility of N&amp;T for the conditions of the &#13;
      vessel upon departure from Tallinn with exception of the too weak locks. &#13;
      They had no knowledge about this hidden defect and said that had they known, &#13;

      It has to be assumed that about 2.500 visitors saw the Exhibition this time.<br/>&#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Seminar Organised by the &#13;
      Royal Technical<br/>&#13;
      University (KTH) Stockholm on 01.12.97 <br/>&#13;
      This seminar, planned already to take place in June, had to be postponed &#13;
      due to the delayed publication of the JAIC Report because it was practically &#13;
      a presentation of work and results of the JAIC. Since Swedish was the main &#13;
      language the Finnish lawyer of Messrs. Meyer Werft did attend and his report &#13;
      reads as follows:<br/>&#13;
      "The purpose of the seminar was apparently an attempt to explain for shipbuilders &#13;
      and engineers the conclusions drawn by the JAIC in its recently published &#13;
      report.<br/>&#13;
      Among the audience one can find a number of representatives for the shipbuilding &#13;
      and shipping industry in general, but also some insurers and lawyers.<br/>&#13;
      First speaker was Ms. Ann-Louise Eksborg, recently appointed chairman of &#13;
      the Swedish national commission. <br/>&#13;
      She discussed the aims and purposes of commission work mainly from an internal &#13;
      Swedish point of view, emphasizing the importance of the JAIC integrity &#13;
      especially towards those authorities, who supervise the activities subject &#13;
      to an investigation, i.e. The Board of Navigation, the Board of Aviation &#13;
      etc. <br/>&#13;
      She took it for granted, that parties subject to an investigation would &#13;
      not participate in the work.<br/>&#13;
      On my question whether she thinks these high principles were followed b &#13;
      the JAIC she immediately grasped the purpose of the question and admitted, &#13;
      that the Estonian members were not impartial if measured by this standard, &#13;
      but she explained their presence in the JAIC with the allegation that apparently &#13;
      all Estonian navigators are or have been employed by the ESCO. There should, &#13;
      however, not remain any doubt among the audience after this answer, about &#13;
      the fact that the JAIC was clearly prejudiced. <br/>&#13;
      Tuomo Karppinen then ventured to explain the sequence of events as per the &#13;
      JAIC's apprehension, first stating that times given have the exactness of &#13;
      ± 2 minutes. <br/>&#13;
      Karppinen then stated that some of the points of time given are more reliable &#13;
      than others, as these can be explained by means of outside sources; such &#13;
      are: the time of departure, the time for passing the waypoint, the time &#13;
      for the first MayDay message and the consequent radio traffic, as well as &#13;
      the time or the Estonia disappearing from the radar screen of the Mariella. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      Karppinen, however, started the summing up of the events with the "bang" &#13;
      heard by the AB, and after that, in my opinion, all points of time are in &#13;
      fact based on the indications given by crew members, not by the passengers. &#13;
      Accordingly the JAIC is, albeit the point of time cannot be verified, of &#13;
      the opinion that the events started at 00.55, that the visor locking devices &#13;
      were broken between 1.05 and 1.10, and that the visor fell off at 1.15 with &#13;
      immediate list as a consequence.<br/>&#13;
      From the evidence recorded it is apparent, that the JAIC is not, as said, &#13;
      attaching any greater significance to statements by passengers. <br/>&#13;
      Karppinen also described the maneuvering of the vessel at this period of &#13;
      time, i.e. the total lack of maneuvers with the exception of the fact that &#13;
      the speed was turned down when the vessel already had a severe list. <br/>&#13;
      A member of the audience very in detail expressed his opinions how a vessel &#13;
      in a situation like this should be maneuvered, by reducing speed, turning &#13;
      the stem/stern against the sea etc., to which Karppinen responded that obviously, &#13;
      if the vessel had been turned such that the angle to the sea would have &#13;
      been abt. 90 degrees, the water could not have entered through the ramp &#13;
      at all and the vessel would have been saved. Karppinen had obvious difficulties &#13;
      with explaining to the audience why the JAIC did not clearly say this in &#13;
      its report. <br/>&#13;
      After this discussion, there could not be any uncertainty in respect of &#13;
      the fact that grave errors by the crew significantly contributed to, if &#13;
      not even caused the accident." <br/>&#13;
      In respect of Rahka's paper, as far as I could understand, the difference &#13;
      in opinions between the yard/the JAIC viz. the strength calculations regarding &#13;
      the visor locks is now being explained with reference to a turning moment &#13;
      caused by the impact of the seas coming from abt 30 degrees to port from &#13;
      the vessel's line of heading. <br/>&#13;
      Rahka emphasized a number of times that irrespective of how the calculations &#13;
      are made ,the locks were too weak anyhow. <br/>&#13;
      Rahka denied, that the JAIC would have said that the speed was of no significance &#13;
      at all; he (and Karppinen) stated, that a speed below 10 kn, would have &#13;
      nullified the risk of visor failure, but the point is that speed impact &#13;
      is linear while wave impact is proportional.<br/>&#13;
      As to Huss's two papers, there was nothing extraordinary to be mentioned.<br/>&#13;
      Fransson discussed the Solas requirements as to the placing of the collision &#13;
      bulkhead extension, and concluded that the solution onboard Estonia was &#13;
      in conflict with the applicable rules.<br/>&#13;
      Much was discussed about the original approval by the FBN and subsequent &#13;
      approvals by the BV on behalf of the Estonian BN. I did ask Fransson what &#13;
      his opinion is about the alleged seaworthiness of the vessel at departure &#13;
      from Tallinn, if the vessel de facto was in breach of the Solas requirements, &#13;
      and he transferred the question to the JAIC representatives, of which Karppinen &#13;
      ventured to answer. He said, that the seaworthiness statement in the report &#13;
      is to be understood as a legal and formal one only! This answer no doubt &#13;
      is the more peculiar, as the breach of the Solas requirements clearly is &#13;
      a "formal and legal" failure, as the vessel no doubt had valid certificates.<br/>&#13;
      In the end I asked Karppinen about the repair list from the Turku repairyard, &#13;
      and the answer was that in fact this was not a quote, but a summary of the &#13;
      items the deck officers had forwarded as a "wish", and Karppinen's rather &#13;
      unfounded conclusion was that actually there were nothing at that time to &#13;
      remark about the locks/hinges/packings! <br/>&#13;
      He had no proper answer to the question that the list no doubt also comprised &#13;
      items which the JAIC has chosen to mention as unrepaired, that is the packings. &#13;
      How the JAIC has arrived at the conclusion that the remaining items were &#13;
      not of importance or, as he is saying, did not exist, is unclear.<br/>&#13;
      He did after the seminar take great pain in explaining to me that the list &#13;
      is not an usual "to do" list, but something else, which I refused to understand. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      As such the seminar was interesting, but too comprehensive with too little &#13;
      space for adequate questions; too much was packed in the program. Another &#13;
      problem was the heterogeneous composition of the audience, a number of participants &#13;
      with knowledge based on media information only took up the time with self-evident &#13;
      questions.<br/>&#13;
      I met afterwards Karppinen and Rahka on the airport, and we had a pleasant &#13;
      discussion waiting for the much delayed plane.<br/>&#13;
      I told them that my opinion is, that they have an uphill task in convincing &#13;
      the interested parties in respect of the correctness of their conclusions, &#13;
      as the JAIC in the eyes of any outsider is prejudiced, and as some conclusions, &#13;
      such as the role of the crew, are obviously quite wrong. The two gentlemen &#13;
      admitted the difficulties with the Estonians once more, but emphasized of &#13;
      course the value of their own contributions. They welcomed me or my prospective &#13;
      principals to study the background material now available at the VTT." <br/>&#13;
      Nothing more remains to be done but to compare the investigation results &#13;
      of the JAIC with those of this 'Group of Experts', which is done in Chapter &#13;
      41. </font></p>&#13;

    Differences in Methodologies </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><br/>&#13;
    When this 'Group of Experts' set out on its assigned task there was considerable &#13;
    experience in writing and structuring of similar reports especially with Capt. &#13;
    Hummel. But then there was the Report of the Court compiled under the direction &#13;
    and written by the Hon. Mr. Justice Sheen on the capsizing of MV HERALD OF &#13;
    FREE ENTERPRISE. A similar accident, brilliant in its clarity and style and &#13;
    - so we still think - an ideal example to use. Justice Sheen in the descriptive &#13;
    part of his Report used the "historical" method in compliance with general &#13;
    practice in writing such reports. The facts are presented in timely order. &#13;
    This 'Group of Experts' hence applied this method as well but adjusted it &#13;
    as far as possible to the different methodology applied by the JAIC in the &#13;
    compilation of their Report in order to ensure comparability of the texts &#13;
    of both reports as best as possible. (See Subchapter 41.1.) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Report of Justice Sheen &#13;
    sets a further example: It compiles all facts relevant to the casualty without &#13;
    regard to source and consequences. No facts are disregarded. Facts deemed &#13;
    relevant which however could not be clarified were clearly marked as such. &#13;
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted this standard and attempted to adhere &#13;
    to it to the fullest extent possible. There were however additional problems &#13;
    in this investigation. Those who had information and knowledge pertaining &#13;
    to the sinking of ESTONIA were often unwilling to share it with this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' or purposely mislead us by offering wrong information. Evidence &#13;
    was destroyed or manipulated. This 'Group of Experts' has therefore augmented &#13;
    the standard by the rule, that facts are only considered to be true if and &#13;
    when they are confirmed by other information. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Last but not least Justice &#13;
    Sheen sets a third example when he draws conclusions only that are fully supported &#13;
    by and not in contradiction with the facts collected and found to be correct. &#13;
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted that standard as well and complied with &#13;
    it.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The methodology of this &#13;
    'Group of Experts' can be summarized in three sentences: <br/>&#13;
    1. Collect and describe all facts provided they pertain to the Casualty. <br/>&#13;
    2. Ensure confirmation of the facts and state which relevant facts are not &#13;
    obtainable or not ensurable.<br/>&#13;
    3. Draw conclusions only provided they match with all confirmed facts. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC - according to their &#13;
    own statements - applied a completely different methodology. They commenced &#13;
    their work by the establishment of a hypothetical assumption of the cause &#13;
    of the accident. Already on the 1.10.1994 Kari Lethola informed the press, &#13;
    the JAIC strongly believed that failure of the visor caused the casualty. &#13;
    See Subchapter 37.2 . On the 17.10 1994 the JAIC published their 2nd Interim &#13;
    Report containing the assumption that the visor had separated from the ship &#13;
    as a result of failure of all three locking mechanisms. When this statement &#13;
    was made, the accident had just happened 19 days ago, the visor had not even &#13;
    been officially located - that happened a day later - see Chapter 24 - and &#13;
    it took another month before it was brought to the surface for inspection &#13;
    on 18.11.1994 - See Chapter 26 - and another two weeks before it was inspected &#13;
    on 2.12.1994 - See Subchapter 37.2. In a press release of 16.12.1994 the JAIC &#13;
    was already able to confirm its opinion that the strength of the locking devices &#13;
    for the bow visor in combination with the sea loads on the visor in the prevailing &#13;
    wave condition and headway of the ship was the main cause of the accident. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    For investigators to work out a theoretical assumption first and then to see &#13;
    whether the facts fit into it, is unusual because such procedure contains &#13;
    the danger of a biased selection or treatment of facts given the nature of &#13;
    human beings. Such method does not merit criticism however if and as long &#13;
    as the investigators have the will and the intellectual flexibility to abandon &#13;
    their preconceived assumptions if not all the facts fit them.<br/>&#13;
    Despite numerous discussions between the members of the two investigating &#13;
    bodies, described in detail in Subchapters 38.1 to 38.3 and the presentation &#13;
    of new facts by this 'Group of Experts', the JAIC on 02.04.1995 published &#13;
    its Interim Part-Report the conclusions as to the cause of the accident had &#13;
    not changed, which did not surprise us, but we were stunned to read that the &#13;
    findings published in this interim report 2,5 years before the publication &#13;
    of the Final Report will remain unchanged See Subchapter 38.3. <br/>&#13;
    The fact that the JAIC did not find a path out of its own prejudice was however &#13;
    by far not the worst malpractice exercised by them in the course of their &#13;
    investigation. Contrary to generally accepted standards again emphasized by &#13;
    Justice Sheen the JAIC from the very beginning of its investigation destroyed &#13;
    evidence vital to any attempt to find the actual cause for the catastrophe. &#13;
    An outstanding example is the bolt of the Atlantic Lock. Having established &#13;
    and published that it was the locking devices, which had failed due to faulty &#13;
    design; the JAIC should have made every possible effort to present the essential &#13;
    piece of evidence to prove their allegation. If nothing else fairness and &#13;
    decency vis-à-vis the accused builder should have commanded such action leave &#13;
    alone the order of the three Primeministers, who had founded the JAIC, to &#13;
    find the true causes for the disaster. Given the importance of this piece &#13;
    of evidence the reason for dumping it into the sea and thereby into oblivion &#13;
    can only be qualified as affront: against everybody affected by the catastrophe: &#13;
    It seemed more important to Mr. Stenström to take the ship's bell with him &#13;
    in the helicopter and it did not appear to him that the bolt could have been &#13;
    sent by normal surface mail if he attributed such importance to the bell. &#13;
    For the sordid details see Chapter 27. <br/>&#13;
    But evidence was not only destroyed, it was also tampered with to an extent &#13;
    unheard of in modern history for an investigation instituted by Westeuropean &#13;
    governments. Again one example will suffice. Reference is made to Chapter &#13;
    34.6 where the manipulation of the underwater video-tapes is described.<br/>&#13;
    As the reader might now assume evidence was also disregarded when it did not &#13;
    fit into the hypothetical assumptions. Again just one example out of all those &#13;
    described in the previous Chapters of Part C of this Report: The recordings &#13;
    made with video cameras of the wreck by divers of the Swedish Navy, when they &#13;
    surveyed it in the first days of the month of October 1994 and those of the &#13;
    divers, who were in the wreck during the investigation of the wreck by the &#13;
    divers of Rockwater A/S have never been presented to the public although members &#13;
    of the JAIC were present on the diving platform at least during the inspection &#13;
    by the divers of Rockwater A/S. See Chapter 27 and Subchapter 34.6. </font></p>&#13;

  Summary </b></font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><br/>&#13;
    In comparing the two Reports the following conclusions seem appropriate:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 1. The Report of the 'German &#13;
    Group of Experts' <br/>&#13;
    Apparently this investigating body was overwhelmed by the magnitude of facts &#13;
    they have collected in the course of their investigation. Although all these &#13;
    facts pertain to the casualty, reading and memorizing them is a nearly impossible &#13;
    task. The reader is therefore sometimes thankful for repetition. The Report &#13;
    assures the reader however that no fact was "left out" whether important for &#13;
    the conclusions or not. <br/>&#13;
    The conclusion drawn on the status of the vessel when she left Tallinn on &#13;
    her last voyage is convincing. A Passengerferry, which carries a false PSSC, &#13;
    is open to the Sea at her bow allowing the sea to gain access to the car deck &#13;
    uncontrolled and finally sets to sea with an unexplained list of 10 degrees &#13;
    - imperfectly corrected by counter ballasting of the port heeling tank - which &#13;
    was however due to a holes in the underwater hull, is unseaworthy to an extent &#13;
    which renders this verdict undebatable. <br/>&#13;
    Whether the casualty scenario complies precisely with the last chaotic minutes &#13;
    of the vessel might be debatable. There are indications of further facts not &#13;
    yet known or still unconfirmed which - if found correct - might necessitate &#13;
    some change in the described scenario.<br/>&#13;
    In methodology the Report complies with good practice. and is insofar based &#13;
    on the Court Report of Justice Sheen on the Capsizing of the HERALD OF FREE &#13;
    ENTERPRISE.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 2. The Report of The Joint &#13;
    Accident Investigation Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden <br/>&#13;
    The layout and presentation of the Report are impressive. Also here the amount &#13;
    of facts collected is stunning but - to compare - it should be noted that &#13;
    this Report deals with quite a few subjects, the German authors have not concerned &#13;
    themselves with. <br/>&#13;
    The casualty scenario is not convincing. It is indisputable that the ramp &#13;
    is still fixed to the wreck. Had the ship indeed steamed against the sea with &#13;
    her ramp resting on the forepeak deck, the ramp would no doubt have been torn &#13;
    off by one of the first waves hitting it in that status. <br/>&#13;
    The Report furthermore reveals an astonishing lack of basic knowledge of seafaring. &#13;
    A vessel of 14,5 years of age which has been subjected to substantial strain, &#13;
    as ferries are, does nowhere in its structure show the same criteria it had &#13;
    as a newbuilding. Fatigue and corrosion are every vessels worst enemies. And &#13;
    furthermore: No shipping expert puts much weight on the statements of crew &#13;
    members after a collision or other accident for which the faulty party is &#13;
    being sought. <br/>&#13;
    There are however other problems with the JAIC Report which actually render &#13;
    it worthless: <br/>&#13;
    The first such problem is the composition of the JAIC. Member of same was &#13;
    Mr Neidre. Mr Neidre was the head of the Navigation Department of ESCO still &#13;
    at the time of his participation in the investigation. The investigation of &#13;
    the activities of precisely this department in conjunction with ESTONIA was &#13;
    one of the tasks of JAIC. Neidre therefore did indeed investigate his own &#13;
    doings. And he kept doing so even after his dismissal, tolerated by the other &#13;
    members of the JAIC. One of the few principles that are generally accepted &#13;
    in democratic states is that no judge or civil servant is allowed to make &#13;
    a decision in the exercise of the public powers vested into him/her which &#13;
    concerns himself. Any violation of this principle renders such decision invalid &#13;
    and subject to removal by the judiciary. <br/>&#13;
    The second problem are the methods chosen by the JAIC for the treatment of &#13;
    evidence. The destruction, manipulation and suppression of vital evidence &#13;
    by public servants in the execution of their duties constitutes a behaviour &#13;
    totally unacceptable in democratic societies and usually subjects the offender &#13;
    to criminal prosecution. The evidence presented by the German 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    for such treatment of evidence vital to the investigation into the causes &#13;
    for the ESTONIA catastrophe is - unfortunately - overwhelming. <br/>&#13;
    The two flaws in the Report of the JAIC described above disclose a third, &#13;
    namely sloppiness. Whether the JAIC had instructions to perform an investigation &#13;
    with predefined outcome - as is indicated by remarks of Mr. Meister and Mr. &#13;
    Stenström - or whether they did not adhere to such instructions or - finally &#13;
    - whether they were never given to them is irrelevant because by application &#13;
    of due diligence owed by public servants to society the Report would have &#13;
    been flawless in any case. As matters stand now the Report of the JAIC can &#13;
    best be described by repetition of one phrase used by Justice Sheen in his &#13;
    Court Report: From top to bottom the Joint Accident Investigation Commission &#13;
    of Estonia, Finland and Sweden was infested with the disease of sloppiness. &#13;
    It is however appropriate to add here the words "and dishonesty", because &#13;
    the members of the JAIC knew or must have known that their sloppiness would &#13;
    result in harm to all those affected by the catastrophe who had put such great &#13;
    hopes on the due fulfilment of their duties by the members of the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
    Despite the lack of excuse for sloppiness and dishonesty of the magnitude &#13;
    found here, two persons bear special responsibility for the failure of the &#13;
    investigation of the JAIC : Mr. Olof Forssberg and Mr. Kari Lethola. Both &#13;
    are trained legal minds and have been the appointed chairmen of the official &#13;

  General Observations</b></font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The vessel &#13;
    was equipped with two controllable-pitch propellers, two rudders and two bow &#13;
    thrusters. It was designed for berthing and unberthing without external assistance. &#13;
    Senior officers who had served on board the vessel when she was under Finnish &#13;
    flag have generally expressed satisfaction with the handling characteristics &#13;
    of the vessel. The fact that the navigation bridge was located aft of the &#13;
    front bulkhead of the superstructure in such a way that the bow of the ship &#13;
    was less visible than normal has not been considered as a disadvantage. As &#13;
    a matter of fact, the flag mast on top of the foremost part of the visor was &#13;
    visible from all positions aft of the control panel whilst the visor itself &#13;
    could only be seen through the lower windows at both sides of the centre part &#13;
    of the bridge. This, as well as the blue steering light on top of the above-mentioned &#13;
    flag mast just shining aft are not mentioned by the JAIC at all. The drawing &#13;
    on page 34 of the Final Report is thus incomplete and the view sector shown &#13;
    is wrong. The correct facts are shown on page 110 above. </font></font></p>&#13;

  Speed Resources</b></font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The ship had &#13;
    a contractual speed of 21 knots at 90 per cent of maximum continuous rating. &#13;
    The practical maximum operating speed of the ship in later years was considered &#13;
    to be 19 knots. This was adequate for the service in which the ship was engaged. &#13;
    To meet the timetable, the average speed in open sea was required to be about &#13;
    17.0 knots on eastbound voyages and about 16.5 knots on westbound voyages. &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The chief officer &#13;
    had the responsibility for cargo handling and planning loading operations. &#13;
    Both second officers were engaged in the actual loading and unloading on the &#13;
    car deck and all lashing of cargo was performed under their supervision.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Besides the &#13;

    loading plan was followed on board - but there was a general scheme - and &#13;
    a sketch of the cargo allocation was made before loading started. According &#13;
    to the JAIC the overall guidance for the lashing of the cargo, given in IMO &#13;
    Resolution A 581 (14)<i> "Guidelines for Securing Arrange-ments for the Transport &#13;
    of Road Vehicles on Ro-Ro Ships"</i> and in IMO Resolution A 714 (17), was &#13;
    applied. The vessel also carried a cargo securing manual, issued by Estline, &#13;
    which however, was not available during the inspection by the two Swedish &#13;
    Sjöfartsverket inspectors and their trainees some hours before the last departure &#13;
    - see Chapter 15. According to frequent travellers personal cars and vans &#13;
    were never secured, trucks and trailers sometimes and trailers without trucks &#13;
    mostly.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the voyage &#13;
    the cargo was checked by the seaman of the watch on his watch-round who had &#13;
    to activate control clocks at particular check points. On the car deck there &#13;
    were said to be one in the forward, one in the middle and one in the aft part. &#13;
    The car deck could also be checked on monitors on the bridge and in the engine &#13;
    control room by means of 4 cameras located forward, aft and at both sides &#13;
    of the centre casing. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 27 September &#13;
    1994 was the last day of ESTONIA in Tallinn and the 13th day of the current &#13;
    14-day duty period of her crew - the Andresson crew. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before the &#13;
    departure a crew list was handed over to the Harbour Master of Tallinn, which &#13;
    according to a fax from Andi Meister to Hans Rosengren - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.186.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    13.186</a> - must have contained 187 names, i. e. 149 crew members on duty, &#13;
    6 trainees, 4 crew members off duty and 28 advisors/ entertainers, although &#13;
    in the fax it is stated that only 27 persons were listed on the advisors'/entertainment &#13;
    list, but one more - Andrus Kullamaa - came on board after the master had &#13;
    already signed the list, thus the second list should contain 186 names, but &#13;
    187 persons were on board.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to a crew &#13;
    list subsequently submitted by the Estonian part of the JAIC, however, actually &#13;
    188 persons should have been on the crew lists of which 3 were not on board, &#13;
    which reduces the number to 185, but 2 others were on board but not on the &#13;
    lists, which increases the number to 187. Nevertheless the Estonian count &#13;
    is 186 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.187.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    13.187</a> - which is not correct because the nautical adviser Juri Aavik &#13;
    is nowhere mentioned.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> One of the crew &#13;
    members off-duty was the master of the second crew, Avo Piht, who was on board &#13;
    to be examined for his pilot exemption certificate when entering the Stockholm &#13;
    archipelago at the Söderarm entrance. For this purpose the sea transport area &#13;
    chief Dan Myrberg and the senior pilot of the Stockholm Pilots' Association &#13;
    Karl-Gustav Sundius, together with their ladies, were also on board. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the &#13;
    files of the Stockholm public prosecutor there were in addition about 25-30 &#13;
    Pakistani workers and an unknown number of relatives of the crew on board &#13;
    who were not registered anywhere.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding &#13;
    of the professional background of the officers and ratings of the ESTONIA &#13;
    some information about the history and the types of vessels used in the Estonian &#13;
    merchant navy shall be presented at the beginning of this Chapter.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1991 Estonia &#13;
    as well as the other two Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania became independent &#13;
    and the country received 3.2% of the tonnage of the former Soviet Russian &#13;
    merchant navy fleet. This tonnage consisted mainly of several dozens conventional &#13;
    type general cargo vessels which were mostly 20 or more years old, and which &#13;
    were supplemented by 15 somewhat newer Ro-Ro/cargo vessels. A group of 6 large &#13;
    and medium sized modern bulk carriers completed the fleet. Container- and &#13;
    reefer-vessels as well as tankers were missing.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Some passenger/car &#13;
    ferries employed mainly since 1991 demonstrate the restructuring process in &#13;
    progress. Before the take-over of the ESTONIA in January 1993 the car/passenger &#13;
    ferry GEORG OTTS - built for the Olympic Games in 1980 - was the largest Estonian &#13;
    ferry</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">. All the sea-going &#13;
    vessels were owned by the National Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) controlled &#13;
    by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The members of the Board &#13;
    of Directors were mainly high ranking civil servants from this Ministry while &#13;
    the management consisted of previous master mariners of Estonian nationality &#13;
    but with Russian education at the Leningrad Maritime Academy. </font></p>&#13;

    an Institute which is not known to impress upon its students to act and decide &#13;
    on their own.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The juniors, &#13;

      will be seen later, it was Tammes who took the lead in the transmission &#13;

    type, which is an old conventional cargo vessel, furthermore he was employed &#13;
    on board of GEORG OTTS as 2nd officer for 17 months, as chief officer for &#13;
    5 months and as master for 4 months, before he took over the ESTONIA in January &#13;
    1993. The car/passenger ferry GEORG OTTS was exclusively employed between &#13;
    Tallinn and Helsinki, i.e. she sailed no more than 20 nm from the nearest &#13;
    land "in sheltered waters". </font></p>&#13;

    total, of which 10 months on a cargo vessel and 16 months on GEORG OTTS as &#13;
    4th and 3rd officer, whereafter he left ESCO and sailed on INREKO ships from &#13;
    February 1993 until August 1994 - according to the statement of ESCO - although &#13;
    at the same time he was already 2nd officer on ESTONIA, which, of course, &#13;
    is not possible, thus there must be something wrong.<i> Only in September &#13;
    1994, thus shortly before the casualty, did he become chief officer. </i></font></p>&#13;

    1 year he was employed on an unknown vessel as 3rd officer and for 3 months &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>3rd officer &#13;
    Andres Tammes</b> had been at sea for <b>only 2 years</b> and 4 months as &#13;
    sailor on a Ro-Ro cargo vessel, whereafter he attended the Kotka Marine School &#13;

    4th officer in January 1994.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above evaluation &#13;
    reveals that master and senior officers were Russian educated, that only the &#13;
    master had spent some considerable time at sea, however, that also his experience &#13;
    with car/passenger ferries was restricted to the GEORG OTTS employed between &#13;
    Helsinki and Tallinn, which is in no way comparable to the Tallinn-Stockholm &#13;
    trade with ESTONIA. The chief officer as well as 2nd officer A - Tormi Ainsalu &#13;
    - had been at sea each for about 5 years only with 16 months respectively &#13;
    6 months on GEORG OTTS as the only car/passenger ferry experience, whilst &#13;
    the 2nd officer B - Peeter Kannussaar - had just 3 years at sea, of which &#13;
    3 months on GEORG OTTS before he joined ESTONIA. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be &#13;
    concluded that neither the master nor the nautical officers had had any previous &#13;
    experience with a comparable vessel when they joined the ESTONIA and that &#13;
    the only one with considerable sea experience was Captain Arvo Andresson, &#13;
    whilst all the others, including the chief officer and the 2nd officer A, &#13;
    could only be considered junior officers. </font></p>&#13;

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>THE DAY IN TALLINN</b></font></p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On 27 September &#13;
    1994 ESTONIA was lying at her berth in Tallinn with open visor and open bow &#13;
    ramp, whilst the crew was carrying out some maintenance work and was preparing &#13;
    her for the take-over of passengers, cars, trucks, and trailers in the late &#13;
    afternoon.</font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> While a number of &#13;
    deckhands were clearing up and cleaning the car deck, provisions and stores &#13;
    were taken over and brought down to the provision area on the 1st deck by &#13;
    means of the big lift at the aft end of the centre casing. At the same time &#13;
    one AB was painting the port anchor from a cherry picker standing on the open &#13;
    bow ramp. Even in summer the port anchor with pocket had to be painted quite &#13;
    often as the anchor was frequently used during berthing manoeuvres at Tallinn &#13;
    when Captain Arvo Andresson was in charge, who was still unable to manoeuvre &#13;
    the big vessel the way his colleagues in Finland and Sweden had done during &#13;
    the past 14 years without problems.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other AB's were &#13;
    painting in the forepart of the car deck near the control panel for visor &#13;
    and bow ramp and the upper flaps of the bow ramp.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At noon two representatives &#13;
    from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, chief inspectors <b>Åke Sjöblom</b> and <b>Gunnar &#13;
    Zahlée</b>, came on board together with a group of nine high ranking officials &#13;
    in Estonian Ship Safety, who were to be trained in Port State Control matters. &#13;
    ESTONIA was selected to be the test vessel for this day (see details in the &#13;
    following Chapter 15). <b>Captain Andresson</b> was said to be ashore, thus &#13;
    the chief mate <b>Juhan Herma</b> and the chief engineer <b>Lembit Leiger</b> &#13;
    were in charge of the ferry. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most of the passengers &#13;
    who returned with the ferry to Stockholm the same evening were ashore on sightseeing &#13;
    tours whilst others attended on board seminars and did not go ashore at all. &#13;
    Among them was a group of Statoil Sweden employees and a group of 68 police &#13;
    civil servants belonging to the ST section of the Stockholm police. The seniors &#13;
    of this group had cabins on the outer and inner side of deck 6 while others &#13;
    were staying in cabins of the 5th and 4th decks.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two members of another &#13;
    group, <b>Rolf Sörman </b>and <b>Nebosja Grkovic</b> - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.3.335.1</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.348.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.4.348</a> - had returned from shore early and were having their lunch &#13;
    in the restaurant "Poseidon" in the aft part of deck 6. They observed six &#13;
    or seven persons at the big table in the centre, one of whom was the master &#13;
    of the second crew, <b>Captain Avo Piht</b>. Another one was an officer wearing &#13;
    a blue uniform. Furthermore there were two ladies and two gentlemen in civil &#13;
    clothes probably the two Stockholm pilots with their ladies. There was a friendly &#13;
    atmosphere. A walky-talky was standing upright on the table and was obviously &#13;
    turned on channel 16 because they heard a gale warning in English. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the new passengers &#13;
    coming on board in the course of the afternoon was the weapons dealer <b>Alexander &#13;
    Vorodin</b>, his father-in-law <b>Vasili Krjutjkov</b>, and his cousin <b>Vassili &#13;
    Vorodin</b>, who received either cabin 6320 or 6230. This is of some importance &#13;
    because later, during the diving survey in December 1994, the suitcase of<b> &#13;
    Alexander Vorodin </b>was taken out of cabin 6230 by a diver. It was the second &#13;
    cabin on the port side in front of deck 6 which however - according to the &#13;
    survivor purser<b> Andres Vihmar </b>- had been assigned to <b>Captain Avo &#13;
    Piht</b>. - See Andres Vihmar's statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    14.195</a> . On the other hand, <b>Vasili Krjutjkov </b>did testify in his &#13;
    first statement - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    14.196</a> that their cabin had been 6230 and only in his subsequent statement &#13;
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.197.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    14.197</a> - said, it had been 6320 while his nephew <b>Vassili Vorodin</b> &#13;
    stated that they had looked out of the window after the abrupt starboard heel. &#13;
    This would not have been possible from cabin 6320 which was an inside cabin &#13;
    without windows. Thus it has to be assumed that the Vorodins were in cabin &#13;
    6230.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the Swedish &#13;
    press photographer<b> Håkan Isefjord </b>came on board with his camera equipment, &#13;
    of which he should later hide one camera with 2 films in lifeboat no. 9 which &#13;
    was the last lifeboat on the starboard side of ESTONIA. When the lifeboat &#13;
    was found several days after the casualty on the Estonian north coast the &#13;
    camera, with two films, was found jammed inside the lifeboat and subsequently &#13;
    delivered to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from where it was sent by diplomatic &#13;
    mail to Stockholm. According to the files of the public prosecutor the films, &#13;
    however, were not in the camera anymore.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another passenger &#13;
    was the auditor <b>Peeter Riit </b>who reportedly came on board rather late &#13;
    since he had missed the last plane to Stockholm and therefore took the ferry. &#13;
    <b>Peeter Riit</b> was employed by the Stockholm auditors KPMG who had been &#13;
    instructed by N&amp;T to examine the books of Estline, Tallinn. Reportedly <b>Peeter &#13;
    Riit </b>had completed this job on 27 September 1994 and was now on his way &#13;
    back to Stockholm with a number of, for ESCO, rather damaging documents.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the passengers &#13;
    were also a considerable number of businessmen, such as <b>Per-Erik Ehrnsten, &#13;
    Carl Övberg</b> and <b>Tony Spuhl</b>, who had made many previous voyages &#13;
    on board the ferry and thus knew the vessel and crew quite well, which also &#13;
    goes for many truck drivers who came up to the Reception Desk after having &#13;
    driven their trucks on to the car deck and were shown to cabins on the 4th &#13;
    deck reserved for truck drivers only. Most of them sensed a certain state &#13;
    of nervousness with the crew members they met which they had never done before &#13;
    on the many earlier voyages.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason for this &#13;
    certain nervousness of some of the crew members could have been the attempt &#13;
    of the Swedish Safety Inspector<b> Åke Sjöblom </b>to stop the ferry from &#13;
    departing which was certainly realised by some crew members and then quickly &#13;
    spread around. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In accordance &#13;
    with the treaty between the Swedish and the Estonian Goverments "Maritime &#13;
    Transport and Safety at Sea and Prevention from Pollution on Marine Environment &#13;
    Projects, Phase IV", signed 03.02.93, the Swedish Sjöfartsverket had sold &#13;
    an education package to the Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B) which &#13;
    was paid for by the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS) &#13;
    and which, among other things, required Sjöfartsverket to train and educate &#13;
    Estonian master mariners and engineers employed with the E.N.M.B. to carry &#13;
    out Port State Control (PSC) surveys on own and foreign vessels and to issue &#13;
    the respective certificates. </font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In Annex A of the &#13;
    treaty the "Scope of Services" is outlined and with reference to "Port State &#13;
    Control" (PSC) the following is explained:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Brush-up seminars &#13;
      and <b>on the job training </b>for ship inspectors in Tallinn, implementing &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In Annex B the obligations &#13;
    of the Estonian side are specified. Under item 7 it is stated:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»To provide &#13;
      all necessary permits, including facilitation of visa formalities and <b>authorisations &#13;
      for the carrying out of the services.</b>«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 02.02.94 the &#13;
    board of BITS agreed to provide the required amount of SEK 574.340,--. The &#13;
    respective agreement contains the following definition in respect of PSC:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The training &#13;
      will be performed in Estonia in one-week seminars for 8-14 participants &#13;
      in accordance with international standards. The seminars include <b>on-the-job &#13;
      training, i.e. in practice actual inspections of vessels in international &#13;
      trade. Our inspectors do expect participants from the E.N.M.B., those responsible &#13;
      for PSC in Tallinn as well as those responsible for safety in ESCO.«</b></i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is revealed from &#13;
    the above that the Estonian authorities did initiate and order the advisory &#13;
    services of Sjöfartsverket. As regards the PSC these services should consist &#13;
    of<b> on-the-job training and actual inspections</b> on board of vessels employed &#13;
    in international trade <b>in the port of Tallinn</b>. According to the treaty &#13;
    the <b>Estonians were obliged to authorise the Swedish inspectors properly &#13;
    for this job.<br/></b>This could only mean that in the light of the treaty and also through &#13;
    the confirmation by the board of BITS, these <b>on-the-job inspections were &#13;
    considered to be normal PSC inspections by properly authorised inspectors.<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the &#13;
    legal background for these inspections - the SOLAS 1974 Convention and the &#13;
    Paris Memorandum of Understanding - the Paris MOU - reference is made to the &#13;
    report of the Independent Fact Group, Stockholm about the <i>"Forgery of Documents &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The statement of &#13;
    Ulf Beijner is, however, available. He has testified that at a confidential &#13;
    meeting at the Sjöfartsverket's head office about 10 days after the casualty &#13;
    Åke Sjöblom explained what they had really found on board the ESTONIA, viz. &#13;
    the absolutely disastrous condition of the bow ramp, the mattresses, blankets &#13;
    and rugs plugged into the gap at the lower corner in way of the severely damaged &#13;
    port hinges, where the bow ramp was already detached from the vessel. Further &#13;
    that they had consequently demanded from their highest ranking trainee, the &#13;
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the E.N.B.M., Arne Valgma, that the &#13;
    ferry should under no circumstances sail in this condition, which was said &#13;
    to have been rejected by him and subsequently by the Estonian authorities &#13;
    up to the highest level.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above has been &#13;
    confirmed by a colleague of Ulf Beijner, the next-in-charge of another district, &#13;
    who added that Åke Sjöblom then - after the Estonians had rejected to stop &#13;
    the ferry - spoke first to his direct superior, Sea Safety Director Bengt-Erik &#13;
    Stenmark, who felt unable to do anything because they had no authority in &#13;
    Tallinn, and subsequently, to the General Director of Sjöfartsverket, Kaj &#13;
    Janérus, who felt also unable to do anything to stop the ferry. The result &#13;
    is well known and 8 hours later the ESTONIA was down at the bottom of the &#13;
    sea and about 1000 people had lost their lives.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The task of chief &#13;
    inspector Åke Sjöblom and inspector Gunnar Zahlée was to demonstrate to a &#13;
    rather high ranking group of Estonian Ship Safety officials, among them the &#13;
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the Estonian National Maritime Board, &#13;
    Sea Safety Director Arne Valgma, the meaning and importance of Port State &#13;

    and he expressly confirmed that it did conform with their real findings and &#13;
    that no other defects were noted. He declared further that of these eight &#13;
    items, six were coded 99, i.e. could be rectified subsequently and only two &#13;
    were coded 17, i.e. to be rectified before departure and this was just the &#13;

    Arne Valgma tried to hide the real findings from his superiors and the Estonian &#13;

    of the E.N.M.B., had been obliged to make sure that the items had been rectified &#13;
    before departure and if that could not have been achieved by the crew, the &#13;
    ferry mandatorily should have stayed in port until all items had been rectified &#13;
    to the satisfaction of the authorities. This is the reason why Arne Valgma &#13;
    tried to play down the problems discovered on board and testified wrongly &#13;
    and incompletely to the criminal police and, in addition, committed forgery &#13;

    limited. </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    inspectors finalised their comments by stating that: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Before the &#13;
      background of what has happened, it is, of course, natural that also we &#13;
      make a connection of certain things. But it is a fact that we had formulated &#13;
      exactly: "We have seen a lack of respect for load line matters", and with &#13;
      this we were particularly very dissatisfied.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In a subsequent &#13;
    phone call Åke Sjöblom told Bengt Schager, the psychological expert of the &#13;
    Swedish Commission, that the crew on board the ESTONIA was the worst he had &#13;
    ever met in his long years of experience. On the other hand, Åke Sjöblom does &#13;
    not create the impression that he has a bad conscience or feels guilty, which &#13;
    is obviously due to the fact that he had tried whatever was in his powers &#13;
    to stop the ferry from departing which, however, was in vain. Contrary to &#13;
    Arne Valgma, who could have stopped the ferry, Åke Sjöblom indeed could have &#13;
    done no more.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has &#13;
    to be concluded here, that it is quite obvious that the Sjöfartsverket's inspectors &#13;
    had found the ESTONIA to be unseaworthy in several respects and consequently &#13;
    had done their utmost to avoid her departure which, however, had been in vain &#13;
    since they did not have the authority to enforce this, although they should &#13;
    have according to the treaty and the BITS agreement. See page 355. After the &#13;
    casualty up to day everything has been done to keep this matter, with the &#13;
    consent and assistance of the JAIC, unex-plained. It is for this reason that &#13;
    the Swedish side and, in particular, Åke Sjöblom have emphasised time and &#13;
    again that the inspection was not a proper PSC but just on-the-job training, &#13;
    while the Estonian side, up to Minister level, still stresses that it was &#13;
    a valid PSC and that the vessel had been found to be seaworthy otherwise she &#13;
    would not have been permitted to sail. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 3rd period of &#13;

    next due date for completion of this Class Renewal III would have been 15 &#13;
    July 1995. The last drydocking was in Turku/Finland in January 1994, when &#13;
    inter alia the periodical bottom survey was carried out and the stabilisers &#13;
    were installed as per Hull Survey Report STK/94/3 A - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.205.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    1994 while the ferry was in service. No remarks about deficiencies affecting &#13;
    the class were noted in any of the reports by the attending surveyor Anders &#13;

    reasons for the L.L. Certificate having been issued "interim" only were</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the "temporary" &#13;
      stability booklet which was not approved by B.V. (on behalf of the Estonian &#13;
      Board of Navigation); <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the too &#13;
      small cross-flooding valve between the heeling tanks.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason why the &#13;
    PSSC was issued wrongly was the fact that the vessel did not comply with the &#13;
    requirements of SOLAS 1974 for the "intended trade", i.e. proceeded more than &#13;
    20 nm from the nearest land, as stated annually in the "Survey Report for &#13;
    the Issue for PSSC - Clause 1 - General Information" and, thus, the bow ramp &#13;
    plus front bulkheads, as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead &#13;
    deck = car deck, were ca. 5.8 m too much forward (see Subchapter 2.4.4 above). &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last issued L.L. &#13;
    Certificate had already expired on 11.09.94 and apparently a further interim &#13;
    one had not been issued by B.V. for reasons unknown to this 'Group of Experts'. &#13;
    In any event, according to the certificates issued after the surveys carried &#13;
    out between the 23-25 August 1994 by Anders Wirstam, the Load Line Survey &#13;
    was apparently carried out and Annex A - to Report No. STK/94/77E - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.206.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    16.1.206</a> - was filled out although, as it looks, no new Interim L.L. Certificate &#13;
    had been issued by the time of the casualty. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">This was, at least, the &#13;
    situation in October/November 1994, since it has to be assumed that N&amp;T would &#13;
    have submitted the L.L. Certificate valid at the time of sinking, had they &#13;
    had it. However, when the Final Report of the Joint Accident Investigation &#13;
    Commission was published, it was most surprising to note that they stated &#13;
    on page 46, item 3.6.2 that there had been a valid L.L. Certificate issued &#13;
    on 9 September 1994. In any event, also this certificate was issued falsely &#13;
    because visor and bow ramp had been leaking for many months before the casualty.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Based on the status of the &#13;
    class and safety certificates only, it could be assumed that the vessel ESTONIA &#13;
    was in an acceptable condition when she departed from Tallinn on 27 September &#13;
    1994. This, however, was definitely not the case as will be demonstrated in &#13;
    the following subchapters</font>.</p>&#13;

    Condition of the Bow Area</font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the information &#13;
    contained in the previous chapters 3.5 and 12 regarding the vessel's performance &#13;
    until 27 September 1994, in particular the various observations of passengers, &#13;
    crew members and other persons on or from the car deck or other decks of the &#13;
    ferry, it has to be concluded that </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(1) the visor, &#13;
    its locking devices (hinges) and rubber packings;<br/></b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) &#13;

    commenced her last voyage on the evening of 27 September 1994.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This conclusion &#13;
    is in direct contradiction to the statements made by Bureau Veritas in the &#13;
    many certificates issued by them in respect of all the safety relevant parts &#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- severe structural damage &#13;
    caused by proceeding through heavy ice at excessive speed.<br/>&#13;
    - the decision of the Technical Managers, N&amp;T, not to renew the rubber packings, &#13;
    assuring weather(water-)tightness of the visor and preventing the visor from &#13;
    vibrating and thereby avoiding cracks emanating therefrom. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The shell plating &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 1</b> - &#13;
    Indentation in the foremost part of the visor bottom indicating that the visor's &#13;
    initial position was changed to forward most probably due to misalignment &#13;
    of the whole structure. This led to contact between the visor bottom and the &#13;
    stempost on the forepeak deck. Since the visor bottom in this area is not &#13;
    constructed to take up load, the bottom became indented and cracked. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 2</b> - &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 3 </b>- &#13;
    Indicates transverse cracks in the visor bottom in way of the contact area &#13;
    with the starboard steel pad welded to the forepeak deck and which should &#13;
    take up about 10% of the visor's weight in closed condition. Since the corresponding &#13;
    port side is not affected at all, it has to be assumed that the starboard &#13;
    side absorbs all the weight which is another indication for the complete misalignment &#13;
    of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Arrow 4 </b>- &#13;
    Indicates a further probably cracked area.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the &#13;
    above it has to be concluded that the visor was completely misaligned in longitudinal, &#13;
    transverse and vertical direction which led to considerable problems during &#13;
    opening and closing. These problems increased all the more as time went by &#13;
    as confirmed by the many observations, e.g. of previous passengers, in particular &#13;
    the truck drivers having spent hours on the car deck waiting for the crew &#13;
    to be able to open the visor (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above). <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The difficulties &#13;
    with the visor are also confirmed by previous crew members and pilots having &#13;
    observed the frequent opening and violent closing until the locating horn &#13;
    on the forepeak deck (pyramid) finally fitted into the mating pocket in the &#13;
    visor bottom (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Consequences of &#13;
    the misaligned visor</b><br/>&#13;
    Due to the increasing misalignment it was at first difficult to close the &#13;
    locking devices and subsequently to open them. <br/>&#13;
    Reportedly it had not been possible to open and close the <b>Atlantic lock</b> &#13;
    hydraulically for several months prior to the casualty and the crew members &#13;
    had to go inside the visor before arrival and after departure from Tallinn &#13;
    and hammer open respectively closed the bolt of the Atlantic lock which, among &#13;
    other things affected the load-carrying capacity of the lugs. Also the <b>hydraulic &#13;
    side locks </b>were difficult to close and subsequently to open. Reportedly &#13;
    on many occasions after arrival in Tallinn the lugs had to be cut off the &#13;
    visor by flame-cutting to be able to open the visor. Subsequently the lugs &#13;
    were rewelded to the visor bulkheads which continuously reduced the load-carrying &#13;
    capacity of these lugs (see Subchapter 12.4.3. and Chapter 30).<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Obviously also &#13;
    the <b>visor hinges</b> had become affected because on 17 September 1994, &#13;
    i.e. 10 days before the last departure, a passenger filmed the visor and, &#13;
    in particular, the starboard visor hinges in Tallinn during the closing procedure.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The passenger &#13;
    was standing in front of deck 7 and filmed the closing of the visor, finally &#13;
    zooming in on the starboard hinges. The video-prints below are part of the &#13;
    film. Picture 2 is an enlargement of Picture 1.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On Picture 2 there &#13;
    are obviously several major deficiencies visible, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the gap between &#13;
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (arrow &#13;
    1). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the outer bushing &#13;
    is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (arrow 2) [which &#13;
    explains the large gap mentioned above]. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) the lower part &#13;
    of outer bushing is missing.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the securing &#13;
    plate is missing and the outer end of the bolt is not visible. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) the outer bushing &#13;
    appears to be twisted anti-clockwise. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) the inner bushing &#13;
    appears to be twisted clockwise.<br/>&#13;
    See also Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 and Chapter 30. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates &#13;
    that the steel- and bronze-bushings of the starboard visor hinge arrangement &#13;
    had been replaced some time ago in a very unpro-fessional way with an extremely &#13;
    poor standard of workmanship.<br/>&#13;
    Also the member of a working team, the nautical student Rain Oolmets, who &#13;
    stayed on board from 15 July to 11 September 1994, had discovered cracks in &#13;
    the welding seams up to 10 cm long between the steel bushings and the visor &#13;
    hinge plates of the port and starboard visor hinge arrangements which underlines &#13;
    the generally poor condition of these safety relevant components. See Subchapter &#13;
    12.5.<br/>&#13;
    It is obvious from the above description of the visible deficiencies that &#13;
    the <b>condition of the visor hinges rendered the vessel already initially &#13;
    unseaworthy. </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Consequences of &#13;
    missing rubber packings<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last &#13;
    Finnish crew had requested the renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of &#13;
    the visor for the then planned yard time in January 1993, because the rubber &#13;
    packing had last been renewed in January 1991. This meant a renewal of the &#13;
    entire packing on the forepeak deck plus about 2 m up each front bulkhead &#13;
    as demonstrated by the following drawing. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg392.jpg" width="371" height="457"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the new technical &#13;
    managers N&amp;T were of the opinion that visors are full of water at sea anyway, &#13;
    the rubber packings were not renewed in January 1993 and also not later. This &#13;
    means that the visor became quickly filled up with water at sea up to the &#13;
    height of the outside water level. In calm sea it was the height of the bow &#13;
    wave which filled the visor up to the 3rd stringer, however, the worse the &#13;
    weather was and the deeper the bow was diving into the waves, the higher the &#13;
    water rose inside the visor.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following &#13;
    picture shows the ESTONIA in Tallinn, with open visor but closed bow ramp &#13;
    so that the otherwise invisible underside of the bow ramp is shown with the &#13;
    lowest section being dark - see arrow. Doubtless this was caused by the water &#13;
    inside the visor with hydraulic oil from the leaking cylinders swimming on &#13;
    top of the water surface. When the vessel reduced speed and the bow wave became &#13;
    smaller and finally disappeared completely when the vessel was alongside, &#13;
    the water streamed out of the visor and the oil settled everywhere inside &#13;
    the visor, also on the bow ramp which forms the aft inside of the visor. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water streaming &#13;
    out of the visor was observed by many passengers when the vessel was alongside &#13;
    in Stockholm with closed visor and, among others, also by the skipper of the &#13;
    Sandhamn pilot boat as well as by several pilots when the ferry was</font> &#13;
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">slowing down during &#13;
    the approach to the pilot boat. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bow wave became &#13;
    smaller and the water streamed at once out of the visor. (See Subchapter 12.4.4.) &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious &#13;
    that at sea inside the visor the conditions in a partly filled ballast water &#13;
    tank did exist with resultant sloshing effects causing additional loads on &#13;
    hinges and locking devices and vibrations to the whole visor, the consequences &#13;
    of which are described in Subchapter 34.3.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(2) The bow ramp, &#13;
    its locking devices, hinges and rubber packings:<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The<b> &#13;
    bow ramp</b> was part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above &#13;
    bulkhead deck and as such had to be mandatorily watertight based on the stringent &#13;
    requirements of SOLAS 1974. This, however, was obviously not the case because &#13;
    back to December 1993 there is reliable evidence that frequently there had &#13;
    been a lot of water on the car deck - see Subchapter 12.4.4. There is also &#13;
    a lot of evidence that the bow ramp was severely misaligned and - in fact &#13;
    - was no more connected to the port outer and probably also inner hinges for &#13;
    some time - see Subchapter 12.4.3. It has thus to be assumed that the water &#13;
    penetrated onto the car deck from the visor, which was filled up to the outside &#13;
    water level, as soon as the vessel was on full speed and the bow wave had &#13;
    risen to ca. 2.5 m height. Since even in calm sea the visor was filled above &#13;
    the level of the 3rd stringer, which is above the car deck level, it is apparent &#13;
    that even in good weather conditions water was streaming onto the car deck. &#13;
    Most of it was most probably absorbed by the 12 scuppers at each side, some &#13;
    of which, however, were reportedly always blocked by stones and other debris.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br/><b>Consequently it has to be assumed that there was already a deadly connection &#13;
    between the always water-filled and -refilled visor and the large, open car &#13;
    deck via the open port lower </b>edge of the bow ramp since some time before &#13;
    the last departure.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The <b>locking devices &#13;
    of the bow ramp</b> were difficult to lock and, once locked, even more difficult &#13;
    to unlock. There is lots of evidence from truck drivers and other passengers &#13;
    having waited for hours on the car deck watching the fruitless attempts to &#13;
    open respectively close the securing bolts hydraulically and, finally, watching &#13;
    them being opened by flame cutting of the upper parts of the mating boxes, &#13;
    which should have been subsequently rewelded but frequently were not. When &#13;
    the crew did not succeed in closing the bolts hydraulically, they tried it &#13;
    by hammering, even by using sledge-hammers and very often gave up, i.e. the &#13;
    ramp remained - at least partly - unsecured! (See Subchapters 12.4.3 / 12.4.5.)<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this led, &#13;
    of course, in time to a considerable reduction of the load-carrying capacity &#13;
    similar as with the hydraulic side locks of the visor. Also <b>the hinges &#13;
    of the bow ramp </b>were severely affected, in particular the <b>port outer &#13;
    hinge</b>. This very heavy hinge arrangement was already damaged before the &#13;
    vessel was taken over by her new owners in January 1993, because the old Finnish &#13;
    crew had already requested renewal at the planned yard time in January 1993 &#13;
    - see Subchapter 6.5.1. Nothing was done by N&amp;T and since the mates of the &#13;
    ESTONIA performed the loading and discharging of the cars and trucks reportedly &#13;
    rather carelessly, the vessel very often had a list during loading or unloading &#13;
    which finally broke the port hinge completely according to the report of a &#13;
    truck driver being an eye witness. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The crew had &#13;
    severe problems to lift up the ramp at all which was only possible after some &#13;
    temporary measurements had been carried out. Ever since, the misalignment &#13;
    of the ramp increased visibly and the problems were growing daily.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>rubber &#13;
    packings</b> around the car deck opening, which should be sealed tight by &#13;
    a properly closed and locked bow ramp, apparently did no more seal watertight &#13;
    since some considerable time already, because the last Finnish crew had ordered<b> &#13;
    10 m of rubber packing to be renewed </b>at the next yard time which was planned &#13;
    for January 1993 - see Subchapter 3.4. - as mentioned before. This was more &#13;
    than half of the total length of the rubber packings, but also these packings &#13;
    were never renewed. </font></p>&#13;

    commenced at about 17.00 hours and was supervised by the 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu &#13;
    assisted by some of the deckhands, such as Valdur Matt, Arne Koppel, Aulis &#13;
    Lee and others. Subsequently also the trainee mate Einar Kukk attended.</font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the &#13;
    surviving crew members having worked on the car deck, the hanging decks had &#13;
    not been in use and the car deck had been full with trucks and cars. Directly &#13;
    in front of the centre casing there had been 2 garbage containers standing &#13;
    one in back of the other towards the bow ramp.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The available <b>cargo &#13;
    documentation</b> consists of the <b>cargo manifest</b> which was received &#13;
    from the Joint Accident Investigation Commission in the early days of the &#13;
    investigation and was said to reflect the description and numbers of trucks/trailers &#13;
    actually loaded, see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 17.1.211</a>. Only recently the<b> freight manifest</b> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.212.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    17.1.213</a> - were received.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Both the cargo manifest &#13;
    and the freight manifest initially contained 38 trucks - although in the consecutive &#13;
    numbering a 39th and 40th truck had been included, of which the 39th was added &#13;
    in handwriting on both manifests. The recently received customs list however &#13;
    reveals that there were actually 40 trucks and trailers loaded. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the &#13;
    customs list the 40th truck, missing on the cargo manifest although the consecutive &#13;
    number on the manifest - 43 744 - had been left open, was a Scania truck with &#13;
    the registration no. AG 565 and with the Latvian driver Gunnar Gobins ((). &#13;
    Since the customs list does not state dimen-sions, weight or type of cargo, &#13;
    no more details are known. The 39th truck added to the cargo manifest in handwriting &#13;
    under the consecutive no. 43 749 was also a Scania truck with the registration &#13;
    no. NRY 806 and with the Swedish driver Leo Sillanpää ((). In the freight &#13;
    manifest - Enclosure 17.1.212 - which is the cargo manifest with added freight &#13;
    figures, both trucks are missing although the consecutive numbers 43 744 and &#13;
    43 749 were left open. It is unknown whether this means that these trucks &#13;
    were carried free of charge and whether this could mean that these are the &#13;
    two trucks escorted into the port and on board by military personnel. (See &#13;
    Subchapter 17.3.)</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> According &#13;
      to information received from a prisoner in the jail of Vaasa/ Finland (after &#13;
      the Luttunen interview) his friend Leo Sillanpää was the driver of a truck &#13;
      which had plutonium hidden between the regular cargo.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is also evident &#13;
    from the customs list that the truck or trailer no. 46 with the number plate &#13;
    417 EEE had no driver registered. It is thus possible that this was the truck &#13;
    or trailer which had been shipped on board the ESTONIA on the basis of incorrect &#13;
    documents and which contained between 148 and 174 Iraqi Kurds according to &#13;
    information from the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, Stockholm. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the &#13;
    statement of an Estonian lawyer, someone from Estline, Stockholm flew to Tallinn &#13;
    by the first plane on the morning of the catastrophe, collected all the cargo &#13;
    and passenger documentation available and flew back by next plane to Stockholm, &#13;
    whereafter the cargo manifest was made up. According to other sources the &#13;
    Estonian Security Police collected already in the early morning hours of the &#13;
    28th the complete cargo documentation from the Estline office in Tallinn. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible customs &#13;
    chief of Frihamn Terminal, Stockholm told Spiegel TV that they had always &#13;
    received the cargo manifest on the evening of the departure by fax, which, &#13;
    however, had not been the case on the evening of 27 September 1994. Even after &#13;
    several reminders they received the cargo manifest only in the afternoon of &#13;
    28 September 1994 from Estline, Stockholm.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, &#13;
    there is another 'cargo manifest' available, which, according to the print-out &#13;
    at the top of the pages, had already been sent at 18.38 hours on 27 September &#13;
    1994, i.e. more than 30 minutes before the departure of ESTONIA, from Estline, &#13;
    Tallinn to presumably Estline, Stockholm. In any event, on 29 November 1994 &#13;
    it was sent by N&amp;T to Industrietechnik, which was the old firm of Börje Stenström, &#13;
    where he worked until his retirement in April 1995, and from whom a member &#13;
    of this 'Group of Experts' received it in March 1995. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the contents &#13;
    appear to be identical on both 'cargo manifests' which were made up by the &#13;
    same E. Kurvits, the handwriting at the end of page 4 is different. This 'cargo &#13;
    manifest' is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.214.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    17.1.214.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently there &#13;
    were doubts from the beginning as to whether the submitted 'cargo manifest' &#13;
    actually reflects all the trucks/trailers having been on board and these doubts &#13;
    have now been confirmed by the customs list hidden for so long, as explained &#13;
    on the previous page. In fact, this list was sent already on 14 October 1994 &#13;
    by fax from the Finnish Embassy, Tallinn, to the head office of the criminal &#13;
    police, Helsinki. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The combined weight &#13;
    of all trucks/trailers was 970 ts according to the cargo manifest - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    17.1.211</a> - and the JAIC states the total truck/trailer-weight to have &#13;
    been 1000 t, therefore it has to be assumed that the weight of the 40th truck &#13;
    was 30 t.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the basis of &#13;
    these weights a stowage plan has been made up always bearing in mind that &#13;
    as much weight as possible had to be placed on the starboard side. The stowage &#13;
    plan is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.215.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 17.1.215 </a>and reveals that it was impossible to place enough &#13;
    weight on the starboard side<b> to create the alleged departure condition. &#13;
    There must have been about 200 tons of weight more at the starboard side elsewhere &#13;
    in the ferry. </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is confirmed &#13;
    by the calculations of Shipconsulting Oy, Turku - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.194.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 17.1.194</a> - according to which there must have been about 200 &#13;
    tons more weight at the starboard side. Such a weight distribution would have &#13;
    created a 10° starboard list without the full port - and the empty starboard &#13;
    heeling tanks, which allegedly reduced the list to 1° starboard. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to survivors &#13;
    trucks and trailers had been more or less equally distributed between the &#13;
    port and the starboard sides of the car deck, thus, a wrong loading of the &#13;
    car deck cannot have been the reason for the excess weight at the starboard &#13;
    side. Consequently it has to be assumed that there has been water in tanks &#13;
    and/or void spaces at the starboard side which was unpumpable. The reason &#13;
    could be that these spaces were holed and thus connected to the outside and &#13;
    therefore could not be pumped empty at all, e.g. the starboard heeling tank.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An indication for &#13;
    such reason could be the image from the "Mudline video", shown below which &#13;
    was made during the diving investigation between 1 and 4 December 1994 - See &#13;
    Chapter 27. The image evidently shows a big hole in way of the starboard hull &#13;
    -/bottom plating area probably in way of the bilge strake. The enhancement &#13;
    of this part of the video tape by means of special equipment confirmed that &#13;
    the plating was indeed holed. - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>&#13;

    was loaded totally wrong at Tallinn?" </i>A: <i>"The wrong loading is regrettable. &#13;
    It would, however, have happened to any other crew!"</i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that &#13;
    the "wrong loading" could have occurred independently of what the crew did &#13;
    or could have done, i.e. it has nothing to do with the loading of the car &#13;

    the holed bottom plating. </font></p>&#13;

  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
    evidence available in respect of the securing of trucks/trailers and other &#13;
    vehicles is naturally controversial. While the crew members testified to having &#13;
    secured all the trucks and trailers, though in different ways, this is confirmed &#13;
    by only very few of the truck drivers/personal car drivers. The majority of &#13;
    the drivers state that the trucks and trailers as well as the personal cars &#13;
    remained unsecured. The truth is probably somewhere in between, i.e. probably &#13;
    the trailers without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to &#13;
    the deck with belts, some additional trucks having wedges in front of and &#13;
    behind the wheels, and a certain number of trucks coming on board last as &#13;
    well as all vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This with certainty &#13;
    had also been the case with the truck and trailer of <b>Per-Arne Persson </b>according &#13;
    to his statement from which the following is quoted:</font></p>&#13;

    whilst Einar Kukk said, the personal cars had wedges in front of the wheels, &#13;
    Valdur Matt stated, passenger cars were not secured by wedges. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the passengers &#13;
    including truck drivers a total of 14 stated something about parking/securing &#13;
    their trucks/cars on the car deck, of which 10 testified that their trucks/cars &#13;
    were not secured and also that they had not seen any other secured or properly &#13;
    secured trucks/trailers/cars and 3 did not know or were unsure. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The conclusion &#13;
    of this 'Group of Experts' is that it has to be assumed that the trailers &#13;
    without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to the deck by &#13;
    belts, that some additional trucks had wedges in front of and behind the wheels, &#13;
    and that a certain number of trucks, which had come on board last, and all &#13;
    vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This refers also to the truck/trailer &#13;
    of Per-Arne Persson, 24 m long, 55 ts. weight and only 20 m behind the bow &#13;
    ramp, and to the heavy garbage containers stowed between the centre casing &#13;
    and the bow ramp and in the aft part. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are rumours &#13;
    that Estline had informed the freight forwarders around noon of 27 September &#13;
    1994 that bad weather had to be expected and that the cargo in/on the trucks &#13;
    had to be secured. It is, however, unknown whether any cargo in the trucks &#13;
    was secured at all. In any event, when the last car had rolled on board the &#13;
    car deck was practically full and the vessel reportedly had a 1° list to starboard.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This weighs &#13;
    particularly heavy since as of noon the south-west storm warning was known &#13;
    to those in command of ESTONIA, i.e. the storm would be hitting the ferry &#13;
    from port, which would increase the already existing starboard heel further. &#13;
    Under these circumstances it would have been not only a matter of good seamanship &#13;
    but a question of ship safety to plan the loading of the car deck in such &#13;
    a way that there was more weight at the port side to compensate for the heeling &#13;
    moment to be expected due to the wind pressure on the port side. See the statement &#13;
    of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    5.3.111.</a> <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This would &#13;
    have been of particular importance because the heeling tanks could not be &#13;
    used to adjust the heeling to be expected. The engineer on watch in the engine &#13;
    control room before and at the time of the casualty - Margus Treu - has consequently &#13;
    testified in his first statement on 29.09.94 at Turku, inter alia: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The port heeling &#13;
      tank was full, but a starboard list of 1° remained. This was, in my opinion, &#13;
      one of the causes of the casualty, because later when the vessel was heeling &#13;
      to starboard there was no possibility to counteract.« </i></font></p>&#13;

    1994 the responsible government organisation in Estonia, the Estonian Meteorological &#13;

    12.00 hours and 21.00 hours (all times UTC = Estonian time minus 2 hours) &#13;

    This had also been the case on the afternoon of the 27 September 1994 when &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the &#13;
    above it has to be concluded that the command of the ESTONIA, at the latest &#13;
    upon receipt of the "Special Prognosis" from the SMHI at 14.11 Estonian time, &#13;
    should have been aware that storm force winds from SW-westerly direction with &#13;
    wind speeds of up to 25 m/s corresponding to Bft. 9-10 and wave heights of &#13;
    up to 5.5 m would be met in the open sea. This was about 3 hours before loading &#13;
    commenced when the master was said to have been ashore and two groups of Estonian &#13;
    "safety inspector trainees" led by two Swedish Sjöfartsverket inspectors were &#13;
    inspecting the ferry accompanied by chief officer Juhan Herma and chief engineer &#13;
    Lembit Leiger (see Chapter 15). The inspection ended only about 11/2 hours &#13;
    before departure and had created considerable problems for the chief officer &#13;
    and the chief engineer who were of course aware of the very severe deficiencies &#13;
    of bow ramp and visor. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    the evidence available no particular precautions were taken by the deck crew &#13;
    on the car deck. While the engine room crew got instructions from the chief &#13;
    engineer to make seafast all moveable things in the engine room as bad weather &#13;
    was to be expected. (Interview motorman Elmar Siegel - July 1996 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.192.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    the forecasted wind speeds and wave heights would be no reason for concern &#13;
    to those in command of a vessel like the ESTONIA, provided, that the vessel &#13;
    was in a seaworthy condition and that her cargo was stowed and secured in &#13;
    accordance with good seamanship. Both criteria, however, were not fulfilled &#13;
    by ESTONIA. </font></p>&#13;

    to the JAIC the vessel departed at 19.15 hours which is said to be a compromise &#13;
    between the Swedish/Finnish and the Estonian Commis-sion members. While the &#13;
    Estonians insisted on 19.00 hours at the beginning (because the departure &#13;
    time has effect on the speed), the Swedes and the Finns referred to the statement &#13;
    of Bengt Nilsson - see Enclosure 20.238 - who had testified as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

    the vessel's trim was said to have been 0.5 m by stern and she had a list &#13;
    of 1° to starboard, although the port heeling tank was full and the starboard &#13;
    heeling tank was said to have been empty and in spite of the fact that gale &#13;
    force winds had been forecasted from SW-ly direction, i.e. from port side, &#13;

    leave Tallinn with some list?" <br/></i>A: <i>"Yes, a list to starboard. Leiger (chief engineer) had phoned the &#13;
    engine room and asked whether it was possible to correct it. It was a mistake &#13;
    made during loading. The tank at the side, which would have to be filled to &#13;
    correct the list, was already full and the tank at the other side was already &#13;
    empty. Therefore we had no possibility to correct the list. It was 1°-2° and &#13;

    crew member - car deck worker Valdur Matt - the bow ramp and visor were properly &#13;
    closed and secured. He was probably the one who moved the turnable forward &#13;
    parts of the bow-ramp rails into backward position and who secured both parts &#13;
    by putting the pins into the respective holes before the bow ramp was lifted &#13;
    up. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the passenger &#13;
    Mikael Öun and others have stated that the visor was definitely closed or, &#13;
    at least, looked closed from the open 8th deck when the ESTONIA pulled back &#13;
    from her berth. Thereafter the passengers left the open deck because it was &#13;
    windy and uncomfortable.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 17.00 &#13;
    hours on the same day the ferry SILJA FESTIVAL had been berthed opposite the &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On Tuesday, &#13;
      27 September 1994, at 13.00 hours, I boarded the SILJA FESTIVAL in Helsinki &#13;
      for a 24-hour cruise. I was accompanied by my son and we had a cabin together. &#13;
      The ferry arrived at Tallinn at 17.00 hours the same day for a 4-hour stay. &#13;
      Most of the passengers went ashore, but I stayed on board with my son and &#13;
      we were walking around the vessel. At about 19.00 hours I was together with &#13;
      my son in the cafeteria on the 4th deck having coffee. I saw through the &#13;
      window that a vessel with the name ESTONIA was leaving the harbour at a &#13;
      distance of about 20-25 m away from us. I knew the vessel from previous &#13;
      times..... The weather was overcast and it was blowing moderately ....... &#13;
      The day was just at dusk. I saw the vessel moving backwards from her berth &#13;
      and saw that her bow visor was open. It seemed to me that it was not fully &#13;
      open, but only half ....... I watched the ESTONIA for some minutes whereafter &#13;
      her foreship disappeared from my view. I did not see whether the vessel's &#13;
      so-called inner door was closed. While the vessel resumed her voyage I saw &#13;
      that both stern ramps were closed. I followed ESTONIA's departing for about &#13;
      5 minutes whereafter the vessel disappeared into the darkness.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I &#13;
      mentioned to my son that the bow visor stood open and told him that for &#13;
      the same reason a Belgian vessel had sunk some time ago. I was informed &#13;
      by crew members of our vessel on the next morning at about 10.00 hours that &#13;
      the ESTONIA had sunk.« <br/></font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete &#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above drawing &#13;
    shows ESTONIA with half open visor. This means that the crew apparently at &#13;
    first closed the visor while the vessel proceeded backwards from the berth &#13;
    and, subsequently, when she had turned inside the breakwater opened it again &#13;
    to a certain extent, possibly half, and passed the breakwater in that condition. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation &#13;
    for this somewhat unusual behaviour was most probably the impossibility for &#13;
    the crew to close the bow ramp completely, i.e. the ramp was closed by the &#13;
    actuators to about 4-5 cm, whereafter normally the two ramp hooks would engage &#13;
    the mating lugs at the upper part of the ramp and pull the ramp tight against &#13;
    the rubber packings, whereafter the securing bolts would move one after the &#13;
    other into mating pockets at the ramp; This was, however, no more possible &#13;
    due to the severe twisting/misalignment of the ramp. This is subsequently &#13;
    explained in detail in Subchapter 29.2, viz.: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) the port upper &#13;
    pocket was intact and only slightly bent towards the centre-line of the ramp &#13;
    with metal at both sides of the pocket slightly ripped which was probably &#13;
    caused by the bending; the bolt was fully extended and about 100 mm below &#13;
    the pocket;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) the port lower &#13;
    pocket was found to be intact with the bolt only partly extended and about &#13;
    100 mm below the pocket;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) The starboard &#13;
    upper pocket was noted to be without cover plate which had been burnt off &#13;
    by the crew in the morning of 27 September 1994 after arrival when it turned &#13;
    out to be impossible to open the bolt; the bolt was fully extended; there &#13;
    was apparently no misalignment between bolt and pocket;</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the starboard &#13;
    lower pocket was crushed together to the effect that the bolt - noted to be &#13;
    fully extended - could never have entered the pocket. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has &#13;
    not been possible for the crew to secure the bow ramp at all by its four securing &#13;
    bolts. The same refers to the port ramp hook which could not engage its mating &#13;
    lug at the ramp, due to the misalignment of the port ramp side as it was demonstrated &#13;
    already by the distance of ca. 100 mm between the mating pockets and bolts. &#13;
    The obvious fact that the port ramp hook had never engaged its mating lug &#13;
    is further confirmed by the intact hook and the intact, unbroken lug. Both &#13;
    hook and lug are visible among other things on the diver video B40a. - See &#13;
    also Subchapter 34.6.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard &#13;
    ramp hook, however, is nowhere visible and the location where it should be, &#13;
    is empty. It has thus to be assumed that also this hook had not engaged its &#13;
    mating lug at the ramp, which means that the ramp had just been closed by &#13;
    the actuators - as stated before - to an remaining opening of 4-5 cm. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to several &#13;
    mooring ropes and two wires found in way of the ramp and respective indications &#13;
    on the ramp - see Chapter 29.2 - it has to be assumed that the crew tried &#13;
    to close the ramp completely by means of mooring ropes and/or wires probably &#13;
    pulled tight by means of the mooring winches on the forecastle deck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg421.jpg" width="262" height="246"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently the &#13;
    visor was closed and locked - see Subchapter 29.2 and Chapter 30 - while the &#13;
    ferry proceeded already outside the breakwater towards the VTS between the &#13;
    Island Nayssaar and the mainland on her last, fatal voyage in a condition &#13;
    which shall again be summarised as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged &#13;
    and misaligned visor, which at sea quickly filled up with water to the outside &#13;
    level, which was also insufficiently locked and secured, and the hinges of &#13;
    which were considerably pre-damaged and weakened, in particular the starboard &#13;
    hinge.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged &#13;
    and misaligned bow ramp, which was not locked at all but most likely held &#13;
    by one or more mooring rope(s)/wires, which was open to the water-filled visor, &#13;
    with the port hinges being broken and the ramp detached from the vessel at &#13;
    this side. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The car deck loaded &#13;
    with only partly or not all secured trucks/trailers and other vehicles.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The port heeling &#13;
    tank full while the starboard one was allegedly empty, a condition depriving &#13;
    the vessel's command subsequently of being able to counteract when the vessel's &#13;
    starboard heel increased due to the forecasted wind pressure on the port side.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - One or more ballast &#13;
    water tanks and/or void spaces being holed/leaking and consequently open to &#13;
    sea. In short, the ferry ESTONIA was in many respects unseaworthy when she &#13;
    departed from her home port for the last time as it is also demonstrated by &#13;
    the images below.</font></p>&#13;

    Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) the weather situation &#13;
    explained below developed during the course of 27 September 1994:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The weather &#13;
    conditions on the 27th September were dominated by a "strong and extensive &#13;
    area of low pressure with several lows" which covered northern Scandinavia &#13;
    and the Arctic Sea. See the weather chart for Europe in Enclosure 1 from 12.00 &#13;
    hours UTC on the 27th September. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One &#13;
    of these lows deepened on the 27th and moved rapidly east via southern Norway &#13;
    and eastern Svealand towards southern Finland. The low remained relatively &#13;
    strong and the centre was near Oslo on the 27th at 12.00 hours UTC with a &#13;
    low pressure of 995 HPA, on the 28th at 00.00 hours UTC it was over the south-eastern &#13;
    part of the Gulf of Bothnia with a low pressure of 980 HPA. On the evening &#13;
    of the 27th a warm front connected to this low with occasional rain showers &#13;
    passed quickly eastward over the northern Baltic. South and south-west of &#13;
    this low pressure a wind change from SW to west occurred and the westerly &#13;
    wind was very squally.«</font></i></p>&#13;

    these estimations by SMHI in the following comments on the route and the casualty. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having passed &#13;
    the breakwater (see Chapter 19) ESTONIA proceeded between the mainland and &#13;
    the Island Nayssaar and - after having passed the buoy off Suurupi Lighthouse &#13;
    - altered course to 262° on the gyro-compass. This was confirmed by passenger &#13;
    Anders Ericson, who had been on the bridge between 20.00 - 20.30 hours ET &#13;
    - see his statement Enclosure 20.239 - and saw the course digitally shown &#13;
    to be 262°, which is actually the true course to the waypoint on 59°20' N; &#13;
    022°00' E. He also realised that the wind speed was then already 20 m/sec. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent &#13;
    fact that ESTONIA had taken her normal route was further confirmed by the &#13;
    observations of the meeting vessel AMBER. The M.V. AMBER is a Polish Ro-Ro &#13;
    vessel, then on voyage from Gdynia to Helsinki when she met ESTONIA. The watch &#13;
    officer of AMBER has only recently been traced and questioned. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    his testimony AMBER passed ESTONIA at 22.15/20 hours CET = 23.15/20 hours &#13;
    Estonian time. ESTONIA was on a course of about 260/265°, at a position about &#13;
    18 nm before the waypoint on 59°20'N; 022°00'E. She was running apparently &#13;
    on full speed against heavy head seas which the watch mate on board of AMBER &#13;
    described as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The ferry was &#13;
      brightly illuminated and appeared to proceed against wind and sea at full &#13;
      speed, which I could hardly believe. According to data from the ARPA her &#13;
      speed was about 18-19 kn. She was pitching heavily and I saw how she was &#13;
      taking a lot of water on the forecastle deck which smashed against the superstructure &#13;
      and was thrown up to the bridge windows and spray was all over the vessel. &#13;
      When her bow smashed into the waves I had the impression that she almost &#13;
      stopped and subsequently built up speed again when the foreship rose. In &#13;
      my opinion those in charge on the bridge of the ESTONIA must have been crazy, &#13;
      absolutely incompetent and inexperienced. I had never seen anything like &#13;
      this before.« <br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete &#13;
      statement is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.237.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
      20.237.</a></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The evidence of &#13;
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk, having been on the bridge until about 00.35 hours, &#13;
    also confirms that ESTONIA at first proceeded to her normal waypoint. In summary &#13;
    of the aforementioned it has to be concluded now that the ESTONIA took the &#13;
    southerly route, i.e. her normal route, to the waypoint on 59°20'N, 022°00'E &#13;
    and that she had apparently no problems until about 23.30 hours, when she &#13;
    was last seen by the watch officer of AMBER. Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned &#13;
    that in the files of the public </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, &#13;
    it has to be mentioned that in the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand &#13;
    the copy of a navy chart was found which indicates that ESTONIA took a course &#13;
    of about 270° true from the end of the Traffic-Separation-Scheme (TSS) between &#13;
    the mainland and the Island Nayssaar straight up to Söderarm. This could have &#13;
    been realistic since it was known from the beginning that she had to enter &#13;
    the archipelago Söderarm because of the pilot examination of Captain Avo Piht. &#13;
    Therefore it would actually not have been necessary first to go down to the &#13;
    waypoint and then go up to the North again. On the other hand, it could also &#13;
    be argued that sailing as long as possible in the shelter of the Estonian &#13;
    North coast would be for the comfort of the passengers, although evidently &#13;
    this was the last thing Arvo Andresson cared about. The navy chart is attached &#13;
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    20.240. </a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    the Finnish Navy, however, ESTONIA took with circa 90% probability a completely &#13;
    different route. Allegedly after having crossed the TSS north of Nayssaar &#13;
    she did follow the westbound lane along the Finnish coast, but subsequently &#13;
    altered course to the south-west. In the opinion of this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    this is the less likely version because it is the longest distance and simply &#13;
    impossible for ESTONIA to pass within the time available. The radar track &#13;
    of this possible route of ESTONIA along the Finnish coast is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    20.241</a> together with the memo about the information received from the &#13;
    head office of the Finnish Navy in December 1998. For more details see Subchapter &#13;
    22.3.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the evidence &#13;
    of the survivor Anders Ericson as well as that of the watch officer of AMBER &#13;
    appears to be reliable and do confirm the normal route along the Estonian &#13;
    North coast to the waypoint, it has to be concluded that this was the route &#13;
    the ESTONIA took on her last voyage. </font></p>&#13;

    and his colleagues went up to the deck where the lifeboats and the liferafts &#13;
    were. They wanted to see how the waves were slashing against the bow of the &#13;
    vessel and therefore were looking down on the bow several decks below them &#13;
    where the waves were smashing against the bow. The waves were smashing so &#13;
    strongly against the bow that the spray water came up to them and they had &#13;
    to protect themselves by seeking shelter behind the steel-sheet covered railing. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bow area &#13;

    Hillerström had heard heavy banging throughout the vessel's hull, which was &#13;
    sometimes felt. Hillerström got the feeling that the vessel was slamming against &#13;
    the waves. He compared it with a motorboat speeding over choppy waves. He &#13;
    did not feel well and at about 23.30 hours ship's time he went to the aft &#13;
    part of the 6th deck, there he found some shelter at starboard behind the &#13;

    of the JAIC Report on page 59, item 5.5:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

      Scheme NW of Suurupi Lighthouse, which ESTONIA passed at about <br/><b>(2)</b> 20.25 i.e. 18.5 nm in 55 minutes, i.e. 20 kn.<br/><b>(3) </b>According to the JAIC, ESTONIA passed Osmussaar Lighthouse at &#13;
      a distance of ca. 7.5 nm. The average speed was 20 kn between (2) and (3). &#13;
      <br/><b>(4) </b>Further according to the JAIC the vessel passed the Apollo buoy &#13;
      at about 22.55 hours, i.e. the distance of 16.5 nm between (3) and (4) was &#13;
      covered in 55 minutes which corresponds to 18 kn. Note: Assuming that ESTONIA &#13;
      passed the Tallinn breakwater already on full speed at 19.30 hours, which &#13;
      the JAIC does but which is certainly too early, but anyway let's assume &#13;
      it, she covered the 73 nm to the passing of AMBER in 3 hours 45 minutes, &#13;
      which corresponds to an average speed of 19.5 kn. <br/><b>(5)</b> Further according to the JAIC the ESTONIA passed the Glotov buoy &#13;
      at about 23.55 hours, i.e. from 23.15 hours. These are 40 minutes in which &#13;
      she passed 10.8 nm, this corresponds to an average speed of 16.2 kn, a speed &#13;
      reduction due to the increasing forward sea, in spite of all 4 main engines &#13;

    alteration to starboard of 25° had been carried out, the wind and sea then &#13;
    should have come more from the port beam. Thus the speed should actually have &#13;
    increased since the full engine output remained unchanged, however, since &#13;
    the stabilisers had been activated after the waypoint, which reduced the speed &#13;
    by ca. 1 kn, it has to be assumed that the speed increase was balanced by &#13;
    the speed decrease and thus the speed over ground probably remained at about &#13;
    15-16 kn, which is rather high under the circumstances prevailing.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    Einar Kukk, Silver Linde returned to the bridge at ca. 00.30 hours, while &#13;
    actually he should have returned already at about 00.00 hours and started &#13;
    his next round at 00.30 hours. According to the statements of Silver Linde, &#13;
    available to this 'Group of Experts' (in total 8), he allegedly returned to &#13;
    the bridge at about 00.00 hours and started his next (and last) round at 00.30 &#13;
    hours. Based on the apparent fact that Silver Linde has given more different &#13;
    statements than anybody else, this 'Group of Experts' is inclined to believe &#13;
    that Einar Kukk, who was new on board and not a crew member, is much less &#13;
    influenced by the surrounding circumstances than Silver Linde was and still &#13;
    is. In case Silver Linde should have returned to the bridge only at about &#13;
    00.30 hours he must have left for his next round shortly afterwards and went &#13;
    again down to the car deck. Since it could not have been the water on the &#13;
    car deck which kept him down there, because this was noted already before &#13;
    22.00 hours when the starboard stern ramp was slightly opened - See Subchapter &#13;
    29.7 - while he had taken over the watch only at 22.00 hours. It has rather &#13;
    to be assumed that the crew activities on the car deck, to hold the visor &#13;
    and the bow ramp, were the reason for his delay.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, &#13;
    ESTONIA continued with unchanged full output to force her way against the &#13;
    still increasing seas while most of her passengers had already gone to bed, &#13;
    be it that they were seasick or that they were just tired of always having &#13;
    to hold on to something due to the hard movements of the ferry. Only very &#13;
    few could sleep, most were lying awake listening to the noises created by &#13;
    the vessel when slamming into the waves and feeling the vibrations caused &#13;
    by the 4 main engines running on full power.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As already &#13;
    outlined in the previous chapter, quite a number of passengers were most irritated &#13;
    by the way the vessel was powering against the waves and many truck drivers &#13;
    were thinking of their trucks down on the car deck, especially those knowing &#13;
    that their trucks were not secured. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular &#13;
    the passengers in the cabins on 1st-deck, i.e. the deck below the car deck, &#13;
    were alerted from the beginning because they were not only below the car deck, &#13;
    but also below the waterline and not far away from the bow area with the partly &#13;
    loose visor moving up and down within the play created by the indented stempost, &#13;
    the missing rubber packings and the worn out lugs of the locking devices.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this respect &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These banging noises - in &#13;
    all probability created by the visor moving within the available play - had &#13;
    already been heard by many passengers on previous voyages, among those was &#13;
    passenger Ivan Petrov who had stayed in cabin 1064 on 22.09.94 and reference &#13;
    is made in this respect to Subchapter 12.4.5 - Other Observations.<br/>&#13;
    The ESTONIA continued all the time on full power against the increasing seas &#13;
    until at about 00.50 hours - after it had been noted or reported that something &#13;
    was wrong with visor and/or bow ramp - the speed was reduced to probably 6 &#13;
    kn until at 01.02 hours the vessel heeled wide to starboard and turned to &#13;
    port. At this moment the farthest point to the West must have been reached, &#13;
    because shortly afterwards at approximately 01.10/12 hours, the main engines &#13;
    stopped and the vessel drifted East or NE and lost the visor about 30 minutes &#13;
    later. It has thus to be assumed that the farthest point to the West has been &#13;
    about 0.5 nm to the West of the alleged visor position, where ESTONIA must &#13;
    have been at about 00.50 hours.<br/><b>Note:</b> After ca. 00.50 hours ESTONIA was first turned to starboard and &#13;
    subsequently to port and was presumably kept on SW course against wind and &#13;
    sea for some time until the sharp port turn commenced, which explains the &#13;
    more southerly Mayday position. The distance from the 23.15 hours-position &#13;
    to the ca. 01.00 hours-position is 30.0 nm which the vessel passed in 1 hour &#13;
    45 min., of which the last ca. 10 minutes were on reduced speed. This corresponds &#13;
    to an average speed of ca. 17 kn. <br/>&#13;
    As the time of the casualty sequence-of-events commenced at about 00.30 hours &#13;
    and ended at about 01.50 hours with the sinking of the ESTONIA the many statements &#13;

    137 persons have survived the catastrophe, some are crew members, two are &#13;
    advisors and the others are passengers. Most of them have testified to the &#13;
    police in Finland, Sweden and/or Estonia, some three or more times. Only a &#13;
    few crew members have been questioned directly by the JAIC.<br/></font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has also &#13;
    interviewed only very few of the passengers or advisers directly, e.g. Pierre &#13;
    Thiger has been interrogated by Olof Forsberg and the statement is attached &#13;
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    telephone to the truck driver Eckard Klug and to the advisors Paula Liikamaa &#13;
    and Peter Järvinen. The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.1.248.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andi Meister's book<i> &#13;
    "The Unfinished Logbook"</i> and also the interview which Jutta Rabe held &#13;
    with him and subsequently with Bengt Schager, the psychological expert to &#13;
    the Swedish part of JAIC, reveal however that the Estonian Commission members &#13;
    as well as the Estonian security police and other government bodies have frequently &#13;
    spoken to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. &#13;
    It is unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings &#13;
    are not available. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    Kari Lethola, chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, the following survivors &#13;
    have not been interrogated at all:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Igor Gricius &#13;
        from Dobele/Latvia,<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Gull-Britt &#13;
        Payr from Stockholm, <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arturas &#13;
        Tamasauskas from Paneveöys/Lithuania.</font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the latter &#13;
    it is only known that he was the driver of the Lithuanian van, No. CVK 445. &#13;
    He refused to testify at all and left the hospital without permission. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Of the other 133 &#13;
    survivors, however, at least one statement of each is available to this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts'; in total there are 243! Contact was made with some of the key &#13;
    witnesses and additional information was obtained and/or relevant information &#13;
    was confirmed. These interviews - in addition to the statements taken by the &#13;
    police - are also available on video cassettes. The interviews were either &#13;
    carried out by a member of this 'Group of Experts', by the Finnish lawyer &#13;
    Henrik Gahmberg or by the Estonian journalist Juri Liim in close co-operation &#13;
    or in the presence of a member of this 'Group of Experts'.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The relevant parts &#13;
    of some of the statements and all of the interviews have been translated into &#13;
    English and are attached as enclosures.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All the available &#13;
    statements and interviews have been analysed, but only those statements of &#13;
    crew members made on the day of their rescue, or shortly thereafter, were &#13;
    considered to be reliable and thus possibly not influenced by the ESCO/Estline/N&amp;T &#13;
    representatives and/or other interested parties. Similar weight was put on &#13;
    statements and interviews where members of this 'Group of Experts' were present &#13;
    and could talk to the survivor directly.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Several drawings &#13;
    are attached which indicate the layout of the crew and passenger cabins on &#13;
    all decks, the car deck with centre casing and lift arrange-ments, the 1st &#13;
    deck with passenger accommodation and engine control room (ECR), further the &#13;
    0-deck with sauna/swimming pool/conference compartments and the sewage treatment &#13;
    area with the vacuum system directly next respectively aft of it and, further &#13;
    aft, the location of the heeling tanks and the stabiliser pockets directly &#13;
    aft of the heeling tanks. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of the &#13;
    analyses of all the available statements and interviews with regard to the &#13;
    time up to and including the casualty sequence of-events are outlined in the &#13;
    following Subchapters 21.2 - 21.9.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other relevant observations &#13;
    made by survivors during and after the sinking, while waiting to be rescued &#13;
    and subsequently after their rescue, is explained in Subchapter 21.8 - Other &#13;
    Observations.</font></p>&#13;

    hours a large wave hit the vessel's port bow.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The master came &#13;
    to the bridge again about 30 minutes later and asked the 3rd officer whether &#13;
    all 4 engines were running, which was confirmed. The master then ordered that &#13;
    the stabilisers were to be activated <b>after the next course change </b>and &#13;
    left the bridge approximately 15 minutes before, i.e. at about 00.05/00.10 &#13;
    hours.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The wind was coming &#13;
    from SW and veering West, whilst the waves came more from southerly directions. &#13;
    The sea was quite heavy.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He was apparently &#13;
    still on the bridge<b> when the vessel changed course around 00.25-00.30 hours, &#13;
    although he never said so,</b> but he stated that the 2nd officer told him &#13;
    that the vessel would make about 1 knot less speed after the stabilisers had &#13;
    been activated. The speed was then about 14.5-15.0 knots. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At about 00.30 &#13;
    hours Silver Linde returned to the bridge and Einar Kukk left for his cabin; &#13;

    round.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He went to his &#13;
    cabin, cleared up some matters and then went to Pub Admiral, where also Karaoke &#13;
    was being performed (5th deck, starboard side, aft). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There he saw Silver &#13;
    Linde in the door at about 00.40 hours. Kukk left after some minutes and went &#13;
    to his cabin. There he arrived at ca. 00.50 hours, went to bed, but could &#13;
    not sleep.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>After 5-10 &#13;
    minutes</b> he heard <b>a very strange noise which was very unusual </b>(and &#13;
    alarming) to him, it could have been an impact or strong vibration and the &#13;
    vessel behaved very strangely; he got up and dressed; <b>while he was putting &#13;
    on his shoes the vessel rocked and heeled abruptly to starboard</b>, he cannot &#13;
    say how much, but it was very far. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He rushed up to &#13;
    the 7th deck and<b> met boatswain Vello Ruben in the central stairway,</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This &#13;
    means that the boatswain had been somewhere further down when the heel occurred &#13;
    - most probably on the car deck - because his cabin was on deck 7. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when he was between &#13;
    6th/7th deck he noted a shock/vibration inside the vessel.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>He and the &#13;
    boatswain helped each other out of the door on to the open deck 7; </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the list was then &#13;
    about 45° and the engines had definitely stopped;</font></p>&#13;

  The Distress Communication</b> </font></p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ESTONIA was equipped, &#13;
    in compliance with the old system, with a radio-telegraphy station and a radio-telephone &#13;
    system. The radio installation and the competence of those serving it satisfied &#13;
    the SOLAS Requirements. In addition, there were some 30-35 portable VHF maritime &#13;
    radio-telephones (walkie-talkies) available to particular crew members which &#13;
    were not indicated in the vessel's radio licence. These VHF-sets could also &#13;
    communicate on channel 16. It is obvious that the transmission power of such &#13;
    VHF-sets is much less than the power of the permanent VHF-installations on &#13;
    the bridge with antennas on top of the mast. As parts of the 'Mayday' transmissions &#13;
    were received very weakly and partly interrupted, it has to be assumed that &#13;
    the mates used their walkie-talkies. Also the many disturbances on channel &#13;
    16 during this time might have played a role.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It cannot, therefore, &#13;
    be excluded that those on the bridge had already tried to get out a 'Mayday &#13;
    message' much earlier. The anonymous information from an A.B. sailor of a &#13;
    large Swedish ferry in the vicinity of the casualty, who called during the &#13;
    "Efterlys"*) TV program in summer 1996 might be a confirmation for this assumption.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> -------------------<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="1">*) "Efterlys" &#13;
    is a Swedish TV program comparable to the German program "Akten-zeichen XY &#13;
    ungelöst" which presents unsolved criminal cases to the public.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The sailor reported &#13;
    that they had heard a very weak 'Mayday' from the ESTONIA already about 30 &#13;
    minutes before the 'Mayday' at 01.22 hours which finally triggered off the &#13;
    rescue operation. They had not reacted because it had been very weak and was &#13;
    not repeated, at least they did not hear anything more and other ferries were &#13;
    much closer. When it subsequently turned out that ESTONIA was really in trouble, &#13;
    he and the mate decided to remain silent about the first weak 'Mayday'. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore the &#13;
    first official 'Mayday' was recorded by the Marine Rescue Coordinating Centre &#13;
    (MRCC) Turku, also very weak and very strange, at</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This in itself already &#13;
    implies the urgent request to (finally) being heard, under-stood and helped. &#13;
    Also on the bridge of the Swedish ferry SILJA SYMPHONY this 'Mayday' was heard &#13;
    and the watch A.B. sailor Jan Öhrn started the tape recorder, thus the subsequent &#13;
    distress communication is fully recorded and the respective transcript, already &#13;

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The statement &#13;
        of Andres Tammes was wrong in some respects, viz. (a) at 01.24 hours the &#13;
        list was at least 50°-60° and therefore they had a blackout of most consumers, &#13;
        because after the auxiliaries shut off at a list of 40°-45° the emergency &#13;
        generator only supplies power to a restricted number of consumers to which &#13;
        the GPS Navigator should have belonged (was installed subsequently and &#13;
        is thus unknown to the yard);</font></p>&#13;
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) even if the &#13;
        GPS Navigator had not been connected to the emergency generator's power &#13;
        supply, it still would have shown the last position for the following &#13;
        15 minutes. Consequently, Andres Tammes cannot have been right in explaining &#13;
        his inability to provide the position with 'blackout'. Rather, it has &#13;
        to be assumed that he was unable to look at the GPS Navigator from the &#13;
        position inside the bridge where he was desperately holding fast to something &#13;
        at the high port side, probably near the aft door. In this connection &#13;
        it has to be borne in mind that - straight after the end of the distress &#13;
        communication at 01.25 hrs. Tammes and Ainsalu left the bridge through &#13;
        the port aft door (statement Henrik Sillaste), and - at 01.25 hrs.</font></p>&#13;

      during this night. I estimate that the average speed on ESTONIA was 14 kn. &#13;
      Her course at 22.00 hours was almost West and she was holding herself quite &#13;
      well at our side. We steered a little more to the West to have the wind &#13;
      from right ahead, which was westerly. <br/>&#13;
      I saw ESTONIA all the time on the radar. I had a vector every 15 minutes. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      At 01.30 hours the master, Captain Thörnroos phoned the bridge and asked &#13;
      how the weather was. I replied something like the vessel's pitching and &#13;
      at the same time I heard on Channel 16 that ESTONIA said one time 'Mayday'. &#13;
      I think that the following words were "blackout" and "heavy listing". I &#13;
      asked the master to come up and that's what he did. I replied immediately &#13;
      to ESTONIA but they did not answer. Also after the master had come up to &#13;
      the bridge I continu-ously tried to get contact but ESTONIA did not answer. &#13;
      Simul-taneously with my attempts to establish contact with ESTONIA I took &#13;
      her radar position ..... .<br/>&#13;
      As soon as the master was on the bridge we altered course towards ESTONIA. &#13;
      The distance was ca. 9 nm when he called 'Mayday'. We could even see ESTONIA &#13;
      visually. Earlier many times I had looked at her through binoculars and &#13;
      knew her silhouette quite well.<br/>&#13;
      After we had heard the 'Mayday' call we saw the lights of ESTONIA. While &#13;
      I was taking care of the navigation, the master was trying to get in contact &#13;
      with Helsinki Radio, first over VHF and then on MF 2182 kHz, both of which &#13;
      failed. He finally managed to get in contact with the shore by mobile phone.«</font></i></p>&#13;

    Nagu/Pärnäs, Rauli Tapio Winberg, must be wrong. Reportedly it had been admitted &#13;

    nobody had been on watch at these stations and that this is the explanation &#13;
    why nobody reacted at the beginning (see also the following Subchapter 22.3 &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Why was the &#13;
      Mayday transmitted so late?</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) Why did SILJA &#13;
      EUROPA and MARIELLA insist on establishing ESTONIA's position, although &#13;
      they knew exactly that the vessel between them and somewhat more to the &#13;
      South was ESTONIA? (These 3 ferries had been arriving at and sailing from &#13;
      Stockholm together since February 1993). This refers in particular to MARIELLA &#13;
      because those on the bridge saw ESTONIA continuously since being overtaken &#13;
      by her off Hangö an the watch officers established her position immediately &#13;
      after they heard the 'Mayday'.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the investigation &#13;
    results of this 'Group of Experts' question one might be explained as follows:<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has been &#13;
    mentioned already at the beginning of this subchapter that the transmissions &#13;
    had been very weak for two reasons, viz.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the mates most &#13;
      probably had used their 'walkie-talkies', and <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Channel &#13;
      16 was considerably disturbed. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore it cannot &#13;
    be excluded and has to be assumed that a 'Mayday' had been called earlier &#13;
    already. This is confirmed, on one hand, by the anonymous telephone report &#13;
    of a watch A.B. on a ferry in the vicinity and, secondly, by the circumstances &#13;
    on board which had mandatorily required the 'Mayday' at the very latest after &#13;
    the big heel at 01.02 hours. The indication of Silver Linde in his statement &#13;
    no. 3 on 17.10.94 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.2.255.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.2.2.255</a>), that he was sent down from the bridge to inform them about &#13;
    the alarm to the Information desk minutes before the big heel, could confirm &#13;
    this as could the statement of Henrik Sillaste<b> that the lifeboat lashings &#13;
    had been released in advance.</b></font></p>&#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The starboard &#13;
      stabiliser which did not move out and a respective alarm had appeared at &#13;
      about 00.30 hours, which activated Margus Treu and was - according to the &#13;
      book of Andi Meister - the real reason to call down Henrik Sillaste, and &#13;
      subsequently Kadak and Sillaste tried to get the stabiliser fin out, probably &#13;
      by beating with a sledge hammer while Treu returned to the ECR. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Margus Treu &#13;
      reported to the bridge that <i>"the bow ramp had been struck and became &#13;
      broke"</i> (that is what Treu told Kadak), most probably after he had seen &#13;
      it.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) Silver Linde &#13;
      reported to the bridge that <i>"there is a lot of water on the car deck, &#13;
      we have to leave the vessel"</i> (overheard by Ervin Roden).</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed &#13;
    with certainty that the watch officer, 2nd officer Peeter Kannussaar, immediately &#13;
    informed the master and chief officer, who certainly came to the bridge probably &#13;
    together with the chief engineer within 2 or 3 minutes maximum. As a next &#13;
    step, the speed was reduced to probably 6 kn (Margus Treu) and the course &#13;
    was slowly changed to starboard with the aim of taking the pressure off the &#13;
    visor and wind and sea on the stern at slow speed and then to send crew members &#13;
    down to the car deck to close the partly open bow ramp. It has to be assumed &#13;
    further that 4th officer Kikas was steering manually during this manoeuvre. &#13;
    When the wind and sea came almost abeam from starboard the vessel began to &#13;
    roll more and more, less to port / wider to starboard and those on the bridge &#13;
    realised that there was the risk of capsizing to starboard and decided to &#13;
    turn back to port. This was apparently done too fast in the attempt to stop &#13;
    the dangerous rolls and the ferry swung rapidly to port and made a wide heel &#13;
    to starboard - reportedly 45°-50° - and came back to almost upright condition. &#13;
    The very abrupt and rapid heel caused numerous people to be catapulted out &#13;
    of their bunks, to be thrown against walls, roulette tables and other heavy &#13;
    objects to be torn loose and smashed against the wall and the like. Therefore &#13;
    it has to be assumed that at the highest point of the superstructure - the &#13;
    bridge - also some or all of those on duty there lost their hold and were &#13;
    catapulted the very long distance across the breadth of the bridge into the &#13;
    starboard wing (where indeed one body was found by the divers). It is not &#13;
    unrealistic to assume that it took them - at least - several minutes to recover, &#13;
    if at all, and then to realise the situation. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has further &#13;
    to be assumed that 2nd officer (B) Kannussaar, whose watch was over at 01.00 &#13;
    hours, was sent down to the car deck, probably together with the nautical &#13;
    adviser Juri Aavik, the chief engineer Lembit Leiger, the boatswain Vello &#13;
    Ruben and some A.B.s, among them Aulis Lee and Aarne Koppel. They were working &#13;
    on the car deck when the two severe impacts occurred around 01.00 hours, shortly &#13;
    afterwards followed by the big starboard heel at 01.02 hours, the vessel righted &#13;
    almost up, but the heel increased again and those on the car deck realised &#13;
    that they had no chance to hold the visor and to close the bow ramp and tried &#13;
    to get up to the bridge, respectively to deck 7. Silver Linde, Aarne Koppel &#13;
    and Aulis Lee made it, they were already on deck 7 opening liferafts when &#13;
    crew members from the cabins on deck 7 came out (the purser Andres Vihmar &#13;
    for example). The passenger Per-Erik Ehrnsten, coming from his cabin on deck &#13;
    6, i.e. only one deck below and located near the forward central stairway, &#13;
    even saw Silver Linde and two other crew members walking in the inner alleyway &#13;
    from the aft crew accommodation forward towards the centre stairway only minutes &#13;
    after the big heel. Aulis Lee even managed to get back to his cabin on the &#13;
    starboard side of deck 4, to pick-up his wife Aina and both got back to deck &#13;
    7 in time and survived. Simultaneously those on the bridge obviously considered &#13;
    their options whilst the situation was deteriorating by the minute, the vessel &#13;
    being now on a south-easterly heading with the deep starboard side exposed &#13;
    to the wind and waves, the main engines shut off, but when the vessel stabilised &#13;
    for some time at a heel of 40°-50° this might have raised hopes for a while &#13;
    that the vessel might stay afloat until the arrival of assistance from shore. &#13;
    This might have caused them to delay the urgently required transmission of &#13;
    'Mayday' and alarm for the passengers even further. When finally at about &#13;
    01.21/01.22 hours the heeling started again to increase 2nd officer Ainsalu &#13;
    desperately called<i> "Mayday, Estonia, please"</i>, etc.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this does &#13;
    not explain why Ainsalu and subsequently also Tammes did not use the bridge &#13;
    installed VHF or even the MF installation being much stronger, which would &#13;
    have connected them with the outside world immediately.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently &#13;
    there must have been circumstances on the bridge which prevented them from &#13;
    using the installations. One reason could be the authority of ESTONIA's master, &#13;
    Arvo Andresson, who never permitted the mates on duty to take any action on &#13;
    their own. Therefore also during this night the mates on the bridge presumably &#13;
    did not dare to undertake on their own such a drastic step as advising the &#13;
    outside world by transmitting a 'Mayday' that the pride of their nation, the &#13;
    ESTONIA, was in serious trouble. Unthinkable according to the philosophy of &#13;
    Arvo Andresson and his superiors ashore, and this could be a reason why the &#13;
    'Mayday' was transmitted so late, i.e. in a situation when main engines and &#13;
    auxiliaries had already shut off automatically and the vessel was heeling &#13;
    at 45°-50° since 01.22 hours.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other &#13;
    hand, it also cannot be excluded that the mates transmitted a 'Mayday' much &#13;
    earlier, i.e. before 01.00 hours already, but by means of the "walkie-talkies" &#13;
    and at a time when transmissions over Channel 16 were severely affected by &#13;
    heavy disturbances.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As, however, &#13;
    no one from the bridge has survived and the evidence of watch A.B. Silver &#13;
    Linde in respect of his observations on the bridge around 01.00 hours have &#13;
    proven to be wrong, because he never was on the bridge after 00.30 hours, &#13;
    and furthermore the four bodies found on the bridge by the divers were not &#13;
    examined - at least not officially - it will probably never become known what &#13;
    happened on the bridge after 00.30 hours, unless the unmanipulated videos &#13;
    are released and/or new diving investigations are carried out.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to 2.) : </font></b></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Why did SILJA EUROPA &#13;
    and MARIELLA insist on establishing ESTONIA's position, although they knew &#13;
    exactly that the vessel between them and somewhat more to the South was ESTONIA? &#13;
    In particular MARIELLA had seen ESTONIA continuously since being overtaken &#13;
    by her off Hangö.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On MARIELLA, &#13;
    only 9 nm away from the casualty, the master Jan-Tore Thörnroos phoned the &#13;
    bridge just at that minute from his bedroom to instruct 2nd officer Ingmar &#13;
    Eklund to further reduce speed as the vessel was pitching in too hard. At &#13;
    that time MARIELLA, being almost twice as large as ESTONIA, was already going &#13;
    several knots slower than the Estonian vessel. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos heard &#13;
    Eklund shouting: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Now Estonia &#13;
      is sending a distress message.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Within less than &#13;
    1 minute Thörnroos appeared barefoot on the bridge. In the meantime Eklund &#13;
    had twice tried to get in contact with ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia - &#13;
      Mariella.«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Estonia - &#13;
      Mariella.« </font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The name of the own &#13;
    vessel always has to be mentioned after the name of the vessel being called.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">But there came &#13;
    no answer. Not before 1 minute and 5 seconds later when a sound, as from a &#13;
    whistle, was heard which most probably was a disturbance caused by somebody &#13;
    activating the transmitter on channel 16 without using it. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a further 15 &#13;
    seconds the desperate voice from ESTONIA came again: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Europa - Estonia &#13;
      - Silja Europa - Estonia.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now chief officer &#13;
    Teijo Seppelin from SILJA EUROPA replied directly in English, which is the &#13;
    normal radio communication language in international waters:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this &#13;
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Ainsalu called again &#13;
    as if he had not heard SILJA EUROPA: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Silja Europa.« &#13;
      </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin replied &#13;
    again:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this &#13;
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He got no reply, &#13;
    21 seconds elapsed before Ainsalu came back:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, &#13;
      Viking - Estonia.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now Ainsalu suddenly &#13;
    called both SILJA EUROPA and the undefined Viking apparently not knowing which &#13;
    Viking vessel was the nearest. The master of MARIELLA had meanwhile arrived &#13;
    on the bridge and tried to get in contact with ESTONIA himself:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Estonia, Estonia.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Immediately thereafter &#13;
    came Ainsalu:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Mayday, Mayday.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two minutes and &#13;
    9 seconds had by now elapsed since the first Mayday. Teijo Seppelin on SILJA &#13;
    EUROPA apparently had difficulties accepting that one of the large Baltic &#13;
    ferries was calling Mayday. He asked again and not fully in line with the &#13;
    international rules for distress traffic by VHF:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia - &#13;
      Silja Europa - asking you - eh. Are calling you Mayday? Estonia, what's &#13;
      going on? Can you reply?« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A correct reply should &#13;
    have been an immediate acknowledgement of the Mayday call and a question for &#13;
    the position. Now a new and somewhat more energetic voice came from the ESTONIA, &#13;
    the 3rd officer Andres Tammes who continued in English:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»This is Estonia.«<br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Then &#13;
      he changed into Finnish. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Who is there? &#13;
      Silja Europa, Estonia.«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied &#13;
      in English.<br/><i> »Yes, Estonia. This is Silja Europa.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, who according &#13;
    to his professional qualifications spoke English, continued in Finnish and &#13;
    now obviously tried to calm down the emotions somewhat by being polite:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Good morning. &#13;
      Do you speak Finnish?«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes,«</font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied<br/><i>»I speak Finnish.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The further communication &#13;
    between Tammes and Seppelin continued in Finnish. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Yes, we have &#13;
      a problem here now,« <br/></i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">said &#13;
      Tammes<br/><i>»a bad list to the right side. I believe that it is 20°, 30°. Could you &#13;
      come to our assistance and also ask Viking Line to come to our assistance?«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied: &#13;
      <br/><i>»Yes, Viking Line is behind us and they surely got the information. Can &#13;
      you give your position?«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes: <br/><i>»...(unclear)...we have blackout, we cannot get it now. I cannot say &#13;
      it.« </i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin:<br/><i>»Okay, understood, we'll take measures.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This was a confusing &#13;
    question from Seppelin and one of the most peculiar ones of the whole rescue &#13;
    operation. These large vessels proceeded on almost the same course every night. &#13;
    SILJA and VIKING departed from Helsinki together at 18.00 hours, while ESTONIA &#13;
    left Tallinn one hour later. All three vessels headed for Sandhamn, where &#13;
    they normally arrived more or less at the same time. Only in strong southerly &#13;
    and south-westerly winds would all three use the northern entrance to Stockholm &#13;
    - Söderarm. They knew exactly where the other vessels were and one look at &#13;
    the radar screen would have told Seppelin where MARIELLA and ESTONIA were. &#13;
    This question to ESTONIA, however, also indicates that he knew where MARIELLA &#13;
    was. Consequently, he should also have been aware that the radar echo on port &#13;
    side aft of abeam was ESTONIA. However, instead of turning SILJA EUROPA soonest &#13;
    towards the already sinking ESTONIA a long discussion via VHF channel 16 commenced &#13;
    about ESTONIA's position. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes &#13;
    from ESTONIA told Teijo Seppelin that they had a 'blackout' which normally &#13;
    means that the power supply has totally failed and thus they were unable to &#13;
    state their position. Both GPS Satellite Navigators installed on the bridge &#13;
    - a "Shipmate" in the control panel and a "Magnavox" in the chartroom - were &#13;
    connected to the emergency generator as well as to the emergency batteries &#13;
    according to the Estonian members of the JAIC. Both GPS Navigators were automatically &#13;
    switched off when the auxiliaries stopped and switched on again after the &#13;
    start of the emergency generator. In order to overlap this break a battery &#13;
    installed in the GPS Navigator supplies power in the meantime and the set &#13;
    remains connected to the chain and shows the position continuously; consequently &#13;
    the position remains on the display, at least of the "Shipmate" GPS. Therefore, &#13;
    this could not have been the reason for Tammes's problem in stating their &#13;
    position. The reason was most probably his difficulties to hold to something &#13;
    at his position in the bridge, most likely at the aft door at port side, because &#13;
    at 01.35 hours when the VHF-communication between Tammes and Seppelin commenced &#13;
    ESTONIA must have heeled ca. 50°-60°, which was quickly increasing, and not &#13;
    20°-30° as stated by Tammes. It was most probably impossible for Tammes from &#13;
    his position to have a look at the "Shipmate" GPS installed in the front console. &#13;
    It took some time for chief mate Juhan Herma to get to the Shipmate from where &#13;
    he had been before inside the bridge and shout the position to Tammes.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now the master of &#13;
    MARIELLA came in:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, &#13;
      Mariella.«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes, Mariella, &#13;
      Europa here - Mariella on 16.« </font></i></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos asked:<br/><i>»Yes, listen, is their position clear to you? Is it they who are on our &#13;
      port side?«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> More peculiar questions, &#13;
    this time from Captain Thörnroos of MARIELLA. The 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund, &#13;
    who had been on the bridge all the time, was able to inform his master directly &#13;
    which echo on the radar screen belonged to ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»There is Estonia!« &#13;
      </i><br/>&#13;
      said Eklund and pointed to the lights on the horizon.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his statement &#13;
    to the Finnish criminal police Captain Thörnroos subsequently also testified &#13;
    that he <i>»saw the lights of Estonia without the help of binoculars.</i>« &#13;
    Eklund had seen ESTONIA overtaking MARIELLA outside Hangö and had followed &#13;
    the radar track ever since. Thus, there could be not doubt which echo was &#13;
    ESTONIA and consequently what her position was.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied &#13;
      to Thörnroos:<br/><i>»No, I didn't get any position from them, but they must be here in the &#13;
      neighbourhood, they have 20°-30° starboard list and blackout.«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied.<br/><i>»I think that they are here at our port side approximately 45°.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now more than 4 &#13;
    minutes had passed since the 1st Mayday of ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin said,<br/><i>»Okay, yes, I am just waking up the skipper.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time &#13;
    MARIELLA altered course towards ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Suddenly Andres Tammes &#13;
    came back, now clearly with desperation in his voice: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Are you coming &#13;
      to assistance?«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously the Estonians &#13;
    had now given up all hope, because the list must then have been some 70°, &#13;
    only 2 minutes later the bridge was under water.</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin asked:<br/><i>»Yes, can you see us?« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, however, &#13;
    in his desperate situation, having to face the loss of his life within the &#13;
    next minutes, apparently did not understand this as he replied:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, I can &#13;
      hear you.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As ESTONIA had been &#13;
    on a south-easterly heading for some time already her deep starboard side &#13;
    was exposed to the wind and sea; SILJA EUROPA was at port side aft of abeam &#13;
    whilst MARIELLA was at port side about abeam, thus both vessels could most &#13;
    likely be seen by those on the bridge of ESTONIA. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin then said: &#13;
      <br/><i>»Okay, we will start to determine your position here now. Just a moment.« &#13;
      </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After Thörnroos had &#13;
    tried in vain to get in contact with Helsinki Radio via VHF or on 2182 kHz, &#13;
    SILJA EUROPA asked:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, have &#13;
      you any visual contact at all with Estonia ?«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »No.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied &#13;
    (which was wrong, because at that time the emergency illumination of ESTONIA &#13;
    was still on.) Since he had seen the lights of ESTONIA clearly on the horizon &#13;
    during the last minutes, this reply is not understandable. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos said &#13;
      later: <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»This &#13;
      was wrong and I shall, of course, be criticised for that.«</i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin then &#13;
      came back to Thörnroos, expressing himself rather softly by saying:<br/><i>»We must start and try to find her somewhere, it is a bit difficult to &#13;
      say as they didn't give any position.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> But now, after all &#13;
    hope for ESTONIA had apparently been given up, the chief mate of ESTONIA managed &#13;
    to lower himself down to the front console where the Shipmate was installed &#13;
    and read their position; his voice has been identified on the tape of the &#13;
    distress communication shouting the position to Andres Tammes, who repeated:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»59°22' (W), &#13;
      21°40' (E)«.</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is unknown whether &#13;
    this was really the correct Mayday position, because on the bridge of MARIELLA &#13;
    the 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund noted the position having been 59°22' N, 21°39' &#13;
    E, about 0.5 nm more to the West. Receipt of the position was confirmed by &#13;
    SILJA EUROPA and then ESTONIA came back for the last time at 01.29.55 hours &#13;
    - 7 minutes and 15 seconds after the first Mayday call and 5 minutes before &#13;
    the battery-powered clock on the starboard side of the bridge stopped :</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Really bad, &#13;
      it looks really bad here now.« </i></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes said &#13;
      and Seppelin replied:<br/><i>»Yes, it looks really bad«</i>, in a sort of routine way always repeating &#13;
      what the other vessel said. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»We are on our &#13;
      way and it is 21.40.«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes came back &#13;
    once more at 01.30.06 hours, apparently in Estonian with a phrase which according &#13;
    to the master of MARE BALTICUM, Erik Moik, meant:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»How far away &#13;
      are you?«</i>, which would certainly make sense. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At &#13;
    that time the ferry must have been more or less on the side. According to &#13;
    Henrik Sillaste - who was then already in the liferaft together with Silver &#13;
    Linde and others - that was approximately the situation when Andres Tammes &#13;
    and Tormi Ainsalu left the bridge through the port door and climbed down to &#13;
    the 7th deck where they helped with the opening of liferafts and pushing them &#13;
    into the water. Whereas the body of Andres Tammes was subsequently found, &#13;
    Tormi Ainsalu is missing.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The behaviour of &#13;
    those on the bridges of SILJA EUROPA and MARIELLA can simply be explained &#13;
    by their reluctance to accept whatever the Estonians did or did not do. When &#13;
    the first rather weak and hesitantly spoken Mayday was heard already at about &#13;
    00.45 hours, the first thought of the officers on the bridges of the MARIELLA, &#13;
    SILJA SYMPHONY and SILJA EUROPA was probably something to the effect of "Oh &#13;
    no, not ESTONIA again, don't they even know what Mayday means?" and, indeed, &#13;
    the first message was not repeated. When the 2nd officer Ainsalu called 'Mayday' &#13;
    again rather weakly and hesitantly and even added "please" at 01.22 hours &#13;
    the reaction on the bridges of the Finnish and Swedish ferries was not much &#13;
    different (in the meantime the officers on SILJA EUROPA had changed watch &#13;
    at 01.00 hours). They simply could not believe that the situation on the ESTONIA &#13;
    was so bad as to justify a Mayday call, an impression which at the beginning &#13;
    may even have been underlined by Andres Tammes's statement: <i>»We have a &#13;
    bad list ..... I believe that it is 20°, 30°.... we have blackout.« </i>Only &#13;
    later, when his voice had become really desperate and the lights of ESTONIA &#13;
    had disappeared, did they realise that the situation was indeed very serious &#13;
    and then they reacted appropriately.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A similar way &#13;
    of thinking may probably have influenced the speed at which the rescue operation &#13;
    was set into motion by those responsible, as will be explained in Chapter &#13;
    22.3. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 29 and 30 September &#13;
    1994 in total 433 immersion suits, 289 lifevests and 8 containers full of &#13;
    lifevests were found along the coast of the Island of Hiumaa. All but one &#13;
    of the 10 lifeboats of the ESTONIA got away from the vessel. Life-boat no. &#13;
    2, i.e. the first one on port side, was still attached to its davits during &#13;
    the ROV and diving investigations. Eight of the remaining 9 lifeboats were &#13;
    found drifting upside down or water filled and they stranded subsequently &#13;
    either on the Estonian mainland beaches or on the Island Hiumaa (Dagö). Lifeboat &#13;
    no. 1 - a motor launch specifically equipped for emergency actions, e.g. man &#13;
    overboard manoeuvres and thus called on board the "MOB rescue boat" - was &#13;
    found near Hangö according to the JAIC report page 130, subchapter 8.10. Upon &#13;
    request for details about the position and condition of the boat the National &#13;
    Bureau of Investigation - Criminal Technological Laboratory - advised however &#13;
    that life-boat No. 1 had actually been picked up on 29 September 1994 at 14.30 &#13;
    hours by the M.V. "HYLJE" (F.B.N. vessel) in position 59°16'40"N; 22°52'12''E &#13;
    and subsequently brought to Hangö - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/23.1.391.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    23.1.391.</a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This position &#13;
    is only 8.5 nm to the south-east of the wreck position and not very likely &#13;
    because the lifeboat had to break loose from its davits before the vessel &#13;
    had settled down on her starboard side at the sea bottom as it otherwise would &#13;
    have been burried in the sea bottom below the vessel. This means that the &#13;
    lifeboat had to break loose from the davits and start drifting on 28.09.94 &#13;
    at about 02.00 hours. At 14.30 hours on 29.09.94 when it was allegedly found, &#13;
    it had been drifting for 36.5 hours already but covered a distance of 8.5 &#13;
    nm only.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other &#13;
    hand according to Supplement 402 to the JAIC Report Annexes 5/5 and 6/4 the &#13;
    lifeboats had drifted already 27.68 nm to the south-east within the first &#13;
    24 hours, while the total distance to the Island Hiumaa (Dagö) is only 33 &#13;
    nm. Therefore the alleged as-found position for lifeboat No. 1 is unrealistic. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Lifeboat No. &#13;
    9 - the last one on the starboard side - was found on the Estonian coast. &#13;
    When it was inspected a camera with two films, belonging to the Swedish press &#13;
    photographer Håkan Isefjord, was found jammed inside the boat. Håkan Isefjord &#13;
    was a passenger but did not survive. The finding of the camera with the two &#13;
    films was reported only days later to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from &#13;
    where the information was passed immediately to the criminal police in Stockholm &#13;
    - See Enclosure 21.1.392. Instructions on how to treat the films were passed &#13;
    to Tallinn and the then acting prosecutor Birgitta Cronier ordered camera &#13;
    and films to be brought to Stockholm soonest. When the objects arrived in &#13;
    Stockholm, however, there were said to be no films. All this is revealed from &#13;
    the files of the finally acting prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand.</font></p>&#13;

    states that the search for the visor continued, although it had been known &#13;
    to the JAIC already since 02.10.94 that the visor was lying next to the bow &#13;
    of the wreck. This is even indicated on the drawing being part of the fax &#13;
    where a smaller separate object can be noted to the starboard side of the &#13;
    bow. Moreover, the area indicated on the same drawing as having been searched &#13;
    - 2 nm to the east of the wreck, 1 nm to the west of the wreck and 1 nm to &#13;
    the south, i.e. a rectangular 3 nm x 1 nm - includes the position where the &#13;

    It is difficult to believe that such a big steel mass as the visor should &#13;
    have been overlooked or should not have been indicated on the sonar. The remark &#13;
    at the end of the fax that<i> "the Norwegian SCS is still active and receives &#13;
    free marketing by the press"</i> suggests that the Norwegians had offered &#13;
    some services which had been rejected by the JAIC and that the operation was &#13;
    performed by Finnish vessels apparently without the expected success. Therefore &#13;
    Lethola was now asking Sweden to send vessels to help search for <i>"what &#13;
    we were looking for"</i>. It is difficult to believe that this relates to &#13;
    the visor which by then must have already been found since some days. The &#13;
    Norwegian involvement needs to be investigated.</font></p>&#13;

    on the 01. or 02.10.94, but decided to keep this secret as well as the actual &#13;
    position of the wreck and to continue the search for the visor. The Estonians &#13;
    were sent to search to the East (where the visor definitely never was) while &#13;
    the Finns with the help of Swedish mine hunting experts and vessels clarified &#13;
    something around the wreck which apparently had to do with Swedish mines. &#13;
    On 18.10.94 the visor was "officially" located and sometime later the "mines" &#13;
    operation was completed, whereafter <b>the recovery of the visor at a position &#13;
    about 2100 m SSW off the alleged wreck position was carried out from 12th &#13;

    permitted Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) equipped with video cameras were &#13;
    sent down to the wreck on 02.10.94 and produced remarkably sharp pictures, &#13;
    which showed, among other things, that the visor was missing and that its &#13;
    hinges and locking devices were broken. Apparently two ROVs were used which &#13;
    were given the names <i>"Jutta"</i> and <i>"Siimo"</i> and which produced &#13;
    an unknown number of video films of which three films are available. These &#13;
    are:</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Copies of these three &#13;
    videos were handed over to this 'Group of Experts' in March 1995 by the Finnish &#13;
    part of the JAIC as "raw material". This turned out to be untrue, because &#13;
    relevant parts, e.g. showing the starboard hull and unknown objects on the &#13;
    bottom of the sea, had been cut out. Therefore a professional examination &#13;
    of the video films by experts has been conducted and revealed that the films &#13;
    have been cut frequently, mostly up to 3 minutes, sometimes up to 17 minutes. &#13;
    The cuts deleted footage taken when the ROVs were inspecting parts of the &#13;
    wreck and also debris on the sea bottom. Consequently it has to be assumed &#13;
    that the most interesting parts permitting conclusions have been cut out of &#13;
    the "raw" material. </font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">From 1st to &#13;
    4th December 1994 the wreck was examined by divers from Rockwater A/S Stavanger &#13;
    and by ROVs from Smit Tak, Rotterdam (parent company of Rockwater A/S) apparently &#13;
    contracted by the Swedish Sjöfarts-verket. The divers were working out of &#13;
    diving bells from the diving support vessel SEMI I. Börje Stenström, member &#13;
    of the Swedish part and head of the technical group, was said to have been &#13;
    the only member of the JAIC on board. In addition, there were on board Arne &#13;
    Valgma, head of the Estonian Ship Safety Division of the E.N.M.B., Ulf Hobro &#13;
    from Nordström &amp; Thulin, the responsible director Johan Fransson and the operations &#13;
    manager Åke Vide from Sjöfartsverket, a number of Swedish criminal police &#13;
    officers, one English salvage expert and the Swedish diving expert Gustav &#13;
    Hanuliak, both on behalf of Sjöfartsverket, as well as some persons unidentified &#13;
    so far.</font></font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> It &#13;
      is doubtful whether Börje Stenström was the only JAIC representative on &#13;
      board as it would be against the general attitude of the Finns demonstrated &#13;
      before and after the diving investigation, namely to be represented by their &#13;
      own people whenever relevant parts of the investigation were carried out. &#13;
      Since the diving investigation of the wreck was the most relevant part of &#13;
      the investigation so far, it has to be assumed that Finland was represented &#13;
      by Tuomo Karppinen, as testified by Arne Valgma who attended on board.<br/>&#13;
      This assumption is shared by the then chairman of the JAIC, Andi Meister, &#13;
      in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i>, where he states that the Estonian &#13;
      participant Arne Valgma shared his monitor cabin with Tuomo Karppinen from &#13;
      the Finnish part of JAIC. According to Andi Meister this was subsequently &#13;
      denied by the Finns who - for understandable reasons - did not want to take &#13;
      over part of the responsibility for the occurrences on board of the diving &#13;
      platform SEMI 1 such as the wilful manipulation and deletion of essential &#13;
      evidence in which Mr. Karppinen most likely participated.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The main purpose &#13;
    of the diving operation, which was paid by the Swedish Government, was to &#13;
    establish:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Could the &#13;
      ESTONIA be lifted up as a whole? <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) How many &#13;
      bodies could be recovered without lifting the vessel, and<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) would &#13;
      it be possible to cover the ESTONIA with stones/concrete?</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the &#13;
    divers had to inspect and record on video tapes the foreship area as well &#13;
    as the navigation bridge on behalf of the JAIC and according to the instructions &#13;
    of Börje Stenström and/or Tuomo Karppinen. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to &#13;
    the Rockwater Report to Sjöfartsverket the underwater work was documented &#13;
    on 19 video tapes which were handed over to Sjöfartsverket/Swedish criminal &#13;
    police before they left the diving platform by helicopter. Allegedly Rockwater &#13;
    kept only those videos on which the safety of the divers was documented, in &#13;
    case health problems should appear, which was not the case. Those videos allegedly &#13;
    were destroyed one week after the last diver entered the bell.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a subsequent &#13;
    meeting in Helsinki on 02.10.96 between the JAIC and the Rockwater representatives &#13;
    Ray Honour, managing director / Dave Cawson, project manager / Terry Jost, &#13;
    diver (one of the two divers having examined the bridge) the following was &#13;
    established: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Whatever the &#13;
      divers did was documented in detail by Rockwater in three different logbooks. &#13;
      It is possible to check each individual episode by comparing the entries &#13;
      in the logbooks with the video logs respectively with the videos themselves. &#13;
      It can be excluded that sequences have been removed from the videos. On &#13;
      some tapes date and times are recorded, on others not because the input &#13;
      had to be made in the operation room which was not done with all tapes. &#13;
      The conditions were very difficult, the visibility was poor, each movement &#13;
      caused a cloud of settled-down sediments.« </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The diving operation &#13;
    was performed by four teams of three divers who worked around the clock from &#13;
    two diving bells hanging next to the wreck. The first diver of the team remained &#13;
    in the bell, the other two proceeded to the designated area where one did &#13;
    the work according to instructions from the supervisor in the operation room &#13;
    while the other secured him by checking his umbilical, etc. The divers worked &#13;
    in diving suits with helmets, which were connected by the said umbilical containing &#13;
    all the necessary supply and communication lines to the diving bell respectively &#13;
    to the diving platform. On top of the helmets one searchlight and one, probably &#13;
    two, video cameras were mounted. The diver received his instructions through &#13;
    two earphones - one in each ear - and spoke into one microphone. On the video &#13;
    tapes available to the public only the voice of the supervisor into one of &#13;
    the earphones and the voice of the diver are audible. Only on some occasions &#13;
    does it become evident that the diver gets additional respectively other instructions &#13;
    when he reacts differently or replies differently, this being particularly &#13;
    obvious when he quickly turns his head away from areas which the public should &#13;
    not see as will be explained on the following pages. It is common practice &#13;
    - according to the diving expert Brian Braidwood - that divers carry two different &#13;
    earphones during an operation like the one under consider-ation here.</font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also these films &#13;
    were handed over to the video experts of Disengage/UK for analysis and evaluation &#13;
    - see Subchapter 34.6.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of the &#13;
    results was that - except videos 11 and 18 - all other video films - although &#13;
    made in the PAL format - had been copied by a PAL/SECAM machine without a &#13;
    converter in between. This results in poor copies, which are much too light &#13;
    and unclear - a fact which makes a proper evaluation of the video material &#13;
    very difficult, sometimes impossible. In addition, relevant parts had been &#13;
    cut out of these videos as will also be demonstrated in Subchapter 34.6.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These videos &#13;
    were and still are being copied in Sweden by a private company called "FORSVARSMEDIA" &#13;
    which is said to work exclusively for the Ministry of Defence, and as such &#13;
    has security clearance. Reportedly Börje Stenström had decided before any &#13;
    copying was done which parts should be hidden from the public and cut out. &#13;
    These concern footage showing the hull above the starboard mudline including &#13;
    the starboard stabiliser and certain areas of the foreship and the bodies &#13;
    inside the wreck and on the bridge. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">While the video &#13;
    sequences showing undesired parts of the wreck were deleted - which fact has &#13;
    led to the discrepancies in the timing as shown by Disengage (see Subchapter &#13;
    34.6) - the bodies have been made invisible by light spots, also the three &#13;
    "official" bodies on the bridge. Even though it is stated in the Rockwater &#13;
    Report, among other things: »The bodies on the bridge showed signs of decomposition, &#13;
    but were also undamaged.«, and the Sjöfartsverket Report added: »On the bridge, &#13;
    where many windows were missing, one body had been attacked by fish.«, the &#13;
    bodies on the bridge were allegedly not identified by their uniforms. This &#13;
    was explained by Börje Stenström, as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The divers &#13;
      did not know any of the victims personally. So, how could they identify &#13;
      them?«</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By &#13;
    the stripes on their uniforms, as it had initially been assumed that all victims &#13;
    were officers. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is most annoying, &#13;
    because the question who was on the bridge during the final minutes is of &#13;
    importance, in particular, whether the master was there.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the distress &#13;
    communication it is known that the watch officer - 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu &#13;
    - the 3rd mate Andres Tammes and most probably also chief officer Juhan Herma &#13;
    - had been on the bridge until 01.30 hours - the end of the 'Mayday' communication &#13;
    - see Subchapter 22.1 - when the vessel was practically on the side. Of these &#13;
    three Ainsalu and Tammes were seen by Sillaste to leave the bridge, while &#13;
    Herma apparently remained inside. According to 3rd engineer Margus Treu, he &#13;
    was asked by 4th mate Kaimar Kikas at a rather late stage after the diesel &#13;
    generators had already shut down, whether he could pump freshwater overboard &#13;
    from the starboard tanks. Thus it could be assumed that the 4th mate also &#13;
    stayed in the bridge. The third body should be the master according to the &#13;
    "evidence" of watch A.B. Silver Linde, which in all probability is wrong because &#13;
    he had not been back to the bridge before, at or after 01.00 hours - see Subchapter &#13;
    21.2.2. Nevertheless, the crew survivors were very certain from the beginning &#13;
    that Captain Andresson had died on the bridge, which is not surprising because &#13;
    it has to be assumed with certainty that at least one of the surviving officers/engineers &#13;
    had been on the bridge after the big heel and seen what had happened.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary this &#13;
    would explain the three bodies as found by the divers, viz. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1) close to the &#13;
      door leading out to the aft on port side, across the door leading to the &#13;
      inside stairway.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2) inside &#13;
      the chart room without further details.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3) in the &#13;
      starboard wing below the broken loose flagbox.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above is revealed &#13;
    from the voice communication between two divers and the supervisors on board &#13;
    the SEMI 1 according to video tapes B40c and B40d which are available and &#13;
    from the Finnish report of the JAIC, page 131. In addition, more information &#13;
    about the bodies became publicly known partly through the Andi Meister book &#13;
    "The Unfinished Logbook" and partly through the Estonian media. These are:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the body at &#13;
      the aft port door was wearing a brown or red/brown suit.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the body &#13;
      underneath the flagbox in the starboard bridge wing had a tattoo on his &#13;
      right hand.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly neither &#13;
    Captain Andresson nor Juhan Herma nor Kaimar Kikas had a tattoo on their right &#13;
    hand and certainly none of them was wearing a brown or red/brown suit. So, &#13;
    who are the three bodies on the bridge and where does this information come &#13;
    from? </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, &#13;
    the detailed knowledge of the Estonians about the condition of the bodies &#13;
    inside the bridge indicates that they had been there with own divers. Furthermore, &#13;
    neither the descriptions above nor the few words of the divers audible on &#13;
    the videos indicate that any of these bodies was badly decomposed and/or had &#13;
    been attacked by fish.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The explanation &#13;
    for this discrepancy was discovered by Disengage when analysing the available &#13;
    footage frame by frame. They found out that the first diver inspecting the &#13;
    bridge - Dave Mawston - before entering the port bridge wing through the lower &#13;
    aft window, which was already broken, cleared away the glass remains and mashwire &#13;
    and then pulled out a body by the hair to the outside where he let it go. &#13;
    This body was only approximately half a body because the lower half was missing, &#13;
    possibly due to having been attacked by fish or by being badly decomposed? &#13;
    Whatever the cause for this terrible injury might have been, this body was &#13;
    neither found near the port aft door nor in the chartroom nor in the starboard &#13;
    wing below a flagbox; it was removed from the bridge before the first diver &#13;
    entered the bridge and before the aforementioned three bodies were found. &#13;
    Consequently there had been a fourth body on the bridge, the existence of &#13;
    which is not mentioned by the Swedish participants. The evaluation of the &#13;
    so-called "Mudline video", showing the starboard hull - and bottom area in &#13;
    way of the mudline, revealed the existence of a fifth body just outside the &#13;
    starboard bridge wing which is also nowhere mentioned. - See Subchapter 34.6. &#13;
    Apparently the Swedes in the JAIC were also hiding these bodies from the only &#13;
    Estonian participant of the diving investigation, Arne Valgma, who was said &#13;
    to have been sleeping during the first inspection of the bridge, because he &#13;
    had been told that nothing special would happen during the hours ahead. He &#13;
    was interviewed on the subject by Spiegel TV, but the interview is not available. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The question remains: &#13;
    Why didn't the Swedes onboard the SEMI 1 arrange for proper identification &#13;
    of the bodies on the bridge and why do they keep secret the fourth and the &#13;
    fifth body?<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were &#13;
    several other incidents respectively observations during the diving survey &#13;
    to which attention has to be drawn, viz.: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The torn and &#13;
      broken open underside of the starboard bridge wing. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The inspection &#13;

      of the rails and the preventer wires of the bow ramp.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The angle &#13;
      iron in the housing of the port bow ramp actuator. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(8) The condition &#13;
      of the starboard stern ramp. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">None of all &#13;
      this is mentioned in the JAIC Report.</font></p>&#13;

      adjacent plating - arrow 2. The paint at the (port) outside of the stanchion &#13;

      however, had not been there on delivery of the ship according to the drawings. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No. 4 - made during &#13;
      the diving investigation on 03.12.94 and shows the plating of the underside &#13;

      03./04.12.94 shows the empty space between the bottom of the bridge and &#13;
      the initial underside plating which is now missing.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious &#13;
    that part of the damage did exist already on 02.10.94, i.e. 4 days after the &#13;
    casualty when the first (official) ROV went down and that the damage was enlarged &#13;
    during the time until the diving investigation of 01.-04.12.94. The damage &#13;
    is not mentioned in either the Smit-Tak/Rockwater Reports nor in the Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    or JAIC Reports and has also not been discussed by the media.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This damage &#13;
    cannot be attributed to the casualty and also does not look as having been &#13;
    caused by fire or explosion. It is however obvious that there is heavy impact &#13;
    damage at the aft lower part of the bulkhead which together with the vertical &#13;
    stanchion supporting the wing was pushed forward. It therefore has to be assumed &#13;
    that this was caused by interested parties searching for something particular &#13;
    hidden inside the void space between the bridge floor and wing underside, &#13;
    prior to and again after 02.10.94.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>as to (2): The &#13;
    inspection of particular cabins on deck 6.</b> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to video &#13;
    B40a and the video tape log page - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    27.411</a> - the diver entered the forward part of deck 6 and tried to enter &#13;
    cabin 6132, which had been occupied by a member of the Stockholm Police ST-Section, &#13;
    but failed, then tried the next cabin 6135 but failed again and then 6134 &#13;
    also without success. The diver returned to the outside for tools and moved &#13;
    in again, broke open cabin 6132 - found a suitcase without name tag and left &#13;
    it behind. He then worked his way to cabin 6230 which was the 2nd cabin from &#13;
    port side of the four luxury cabins in the fore part of deck 6 overlooking &#13;
    the foreship. According to the statement of purser Andres Vihmar of 15.05.96 &#13;
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    14.195</a> - this cabin had been assigned to the master of the second crew, &#13;
    Captain Avo Piht. In the alleyway in front of this cabin the diver found a &#13;
    body. The diver, obviously receiving instructions through his second earphone &#13;
    not audible on the available video, broke up the door and headed straight &#13;
    for a suitcase, which was open but - according to the diver - apparently nothing &#13;
    was missing (how could he know?) and the suitcase had a label with the name &#13;
    Alexander Vorodin. The diver carried the suitcase out of the accommodation &#13;
    and it was apparently hoisted up to the diving platform. The diver subsequently &#13;
    broke open or tried to break open the cabins in the vicinity of cabin 6230, &#13;
    all of which had been occupied by members of the ST-Section of the Stockholm &#13;
    Police. The owner of the suitcase, Alexander Vorodin, had been on board together &#13;
    with his uncle and nephew, and all three survived. According to the first &#13;
    and only statement of Alexander Vorodin and to the 2nd statement of his uncle, &#13;
    Vasili Krjutjkov, they had been in cabin 6320. In his 1st statement Vasili &#13;
    Krjutjkov testified, however, that they had been in cabin 6230 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    14.196</a> - which was indirectly confirmed by his young nephew Vassili Vorodin &#13;
    - see his statement <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.341.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.4.341</a> - who testified that he had been thrown out of his bed to the &#13;
    floor by the big heel and thereafter they had looked out of the window and &#13;
    seen the vessel heeling heavily to starboard. As can be seen from the drawing &#13;
    below showing the forepart of deck 6 - cabin 6320 is an inner cabin without &#13;
    windows and with only 2 beds (1 upper/1 lower) which are arranged athwartships, &#13;
    thus no one would be thrown out these beds if the vessel suddenly heeled to &#13;
    starboard. Cabin 6230, however, has 2 upper and 2 lower beds which are arranged &#13;
    in longitudinal direction, i.e. if the vessel suddenly heeled to starboard &#13;
    somebody in the port side beds could be thrown to the floor as it happened &#13;
    to Vassili Vorodin. Furthermore this cabin has two windows overlooking the &#13;
    foreship.</font></p>&#13;

    Vorodins had been in cabin 6230 which is also confirmed by the presence of &#13;
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin in this cabin. The question is why did Andres &#13;
    Vihmar testify to the police that it was the cabin of Captain Avo Piht where &#13;
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin was found, who had the reputation of being &#13;
    a weapons smuggler, and was therefore so interesting to the criminal police &#13;
    of Stockholm. A transcript with the voice communication during the above explained &#13;

    27.411.1</a> - the diver S. Jessop entered the forward part of the 1st deck &#13;
    through an opening cut by the divers into the shell plating. He examined the &#13;
    port side cabins, established that the only accessible watertight door was &#13;
    closed (all doors close from port to starboard, thus it has to be assumed &#13;
    that the door had closed by gravity due to the starboard list after the hydraulic &#13;
    pressure had slackened sometime after the sinking) and then - according to &#13;
    the video log proceeded at 14.54 hours <b>towards the spiral stairway</b>, &#13;
    which<b> only leads to the sauna and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck</b>, &#13;
    where damage to the starboard shell plating is assumed. Without any notation &#13;
    in between the log continues after 1 hour and 6 minutes without any explanation &#13;
    as to what the diver did during this time. Thereafter the diver left the wreck &#13;
    through the outside opening. The lower part of the video log page No. 1 - &#13;
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    27.411.1</a> - shows the respective entries. Apparently the times 14.54 and &#13;
    16.00 have been manipula- ted and the page was cut between these figures, &#13;
    something which had been written in between has been taken out and both parts &#13;
    of the page copied together. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The part taken &#13;
    away concerns the activity of the diver between 14.54 and 16.00 in the area &#13;
    at the end of the spiral stairway which is the 0-deck with sauna- and swimming-pool &#13;
    compartments. It is obvious that the JAIC did not desire that the inspection &#13;
    results were made public. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (4): The &#13;
    ROV has not been inside the car deck and the consequences.</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In spite of five &#13;
    attempts and although the supervisor says so, the ROV cannot have entered &#13;
    the car deck through the bow ramp opening, because</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the video &#13;
      sequences do not confirm this, and <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the video &#13;
      depth shown on the ROV display - 81 m - is too deep for the car deck. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless the &#13;
    ROV moves between pallets with cement bags and other objects looking like &#13;
    cargo apparently lying on the sea bottom. As it is highly unlikely that this &#13;
    intact looking cargo originates from other vessels, it must have come from &#13;
    ESTONIA even though the bow ramp and both stern ramps are closed or almost &#13;
    closed. Although the starboard stern ramp was certainly more open at some &#13;
    stage when the vessel was still afloat and severely heeled, it is very difficult &#13;
    to assume that cement bags on pallets should have fallen off some truck or &#13;
    trailer and then out through the open ramp and exactly next to the position &#13;
    where the vessel finally settled down. The respective video is B40b from 03.12.1994. &#13;
    Another open question which demands clarification. See also Subchapter 34.6. &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On video B40c the &#13;
    "official" diver was working on top of the bow ramp looking into the car deck &#13;
    when suddenly a frogman type diver appeared in the beam of his searchlight &#13;
    who rapidly tried to get away by swimming backwards, however, was picked-up &#13;
    by the camera. <br/>&#13;
    On another occasion air bubbles are coming up from the car deck, although &#13;
    the "official" divers do not produce air bubbles and allegedly were not working &#13;
    inside the car deck at all. On a further occasion lights can be seen inside &#13;
    the car deck, although the "official" divers have not been there.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On another &#13;
    occasion the supervisor said: <i>"They are getting their diver(s) back." </i>or &#13;
    <i>"We have to wait until they get their divers back." </i>On another occasion &#13;
    the supervisor said to the diver:<i> "We have to stay on the outside, the &#13;
    inside is no good for us" </i>obviously meaning the car deck. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates &#13;
    that another diving operation by other divers went on simultaneously, longer &#13;
    or shorter, than the official one and it is indeed the question what these &#13;
    divers were doing inside the car deck and why their activity was and still &#13;
    is kept secret?</font></p>&#13;

    part of the diver video tape B40c of 03.12.94 which proves that the bow ramp &#13;
    rail on both sides had disappeared. As it is difficult to believe that the &#13;
    bow ramp should have had no rails without anyone - including the Swedish safety &#13;

    time? As the above image was taken from the ROV video from 09.10.94 it is &#13;

    was produced from footage made when the diver looked into the actuator opening &#13;
    more from the side. The image was enhanced by Disengage with special equipment &#13;
    and it revealed that some strong steel piece was sticking behind the actuator. &#13;
    Further analysis of this footage revealed that this was an angle iron (arrow &#13;
    1) which had obviously at some stage been pressed into the adjacent bulkhead &#13;
    plating (arrow 2) with the bulkhead port in between unaffected (arrow 3). &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was at first &#13;
    assumed that this angle iron had been placed there to sabotage the complete &#13;
    closing of the bow ramp, however on second thought it is more likely that &#13;
    this steel piece had been placed there deliberately by the crew to prevent &#13;
    the actuator fastening from hooking at the edge of the front bulkhead because &#13;
    the ramp had been considerably hanging down with its port side due to the &#13;
    broken port hinges which had destroyed the initial alignment of the actuator &#13;
    fastenings in the vessel and at the ramp.</font></p>&#13;

    down at the port side with respective effect on the port actuator which was &#13;
    hooking at and rubbing against the bulkhead in way of the lower edge of the &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In preparation &#13;
    of the covering of the wreck as decided by the Swedish Government already &#13;
    in 1995 the Finnish Environment Protection Organisation and the Finnish Board &#13;
    of Navigation began with preparations in spring 1996 to pump out the heavy &#13;
    fuel from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA as soon as the weather situation &#13;
    permitted. For this purpose reportedly two sophisticated ROVs were leased &#13;
    from Norwegian off-shore operators, which could also perform underwater flame-cutting. &#13;
    Furthermore, the oil-pollution fighting vessel HALLI was equipped with an &#13;
    installation able to warm up the asphalt-like heavy fuel and then pump up &#13;
    the liquid part, a rather time consuming matter. This installation proved &#13;
    to be very sensitive and thus work could only be performed up to wind force &#13;
    Bft. 4, whereafter the installation had to be pulled up. In order to make &#13;
    use of the sophisticated ROVs Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka from the Finnish &#13;
    part of the JAIC then frequently took the chance to make further ROV surveys &#13;
    of the wreck. A request by a member of this 'Group of Experts' for permission &#13;
    to attend one of these ROV surveys of the wreck was categorically denied by &#13;
    the Finns. </font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently a copy &#13;
    of a video allegedly made on 19.06.96 was received which shows images of good &#13;
    quality (PAL format and copied to PAL) of the foreship area only, although &#13;
    the complete vessel had been resurveyed and more videos had been made which, &#13;
    however, were not made available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation of &#13;
    the video tape revealed that the area around the port outer ramp hinge was &#13;
    now quite well visible without the mattresses, blankets and whatever else &#13;
    the crew had squeezed into the gap created by the partly open bow ramp. A &#13;
    damage hole in the port lower front bulkhead can be seen which will be explained &#13;
    in Subchapter 29.2.Also a strong lug welded to the front bulkhead is visible &#13;
    which was fitted by the yard for the wire controlling the bow ramp ropes.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The video further &#13;
    produced very clear images of both the port and the starboard visor hinge &#13;
    bolts, both front bulkheads and parts of the bow ramp which improved the evidence &#13;
    available already and which is further discussed in Subchapter 29.2.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon respective &#13;
    questioning, Karppinen and Rahka advised that there were no holes in the hull &#13;
    and that otherwise no changes to the wreck had been observed. Only later did &#13;
    it become public that during these ROV surveys it was discovered that steel &#13;
    plates, which the divers had previously fitted and welded over the holes cut &#13;
    by them into the shell plating forward and aft in way of deck 1, had been &#13;
    removed from their openings in the meantime. (Theses plates reportedly weighed &#13;
    500 kg.)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed &#13;
    that those who removed the heavy steel covers from the openings are probably &#13;
    identical with those who broke off the steel sheeting underneath the port &#13;
    bridge wing - see Chapter 27. Needless to say that these facts are not mentioned &#13;
    in the Report of the JAIC. </font></p>&#13;

      Starboard bilge is clear from the seabed and the deck side is partly buried &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 and 2 - show &#13;
      the visor ashore at Hangö in the position as it had been attached to the &#13;
      ship.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 3 - shows the &#13;
      large indentation at starboard side of which the larger, lower part was &#13;
      probably caused by contact with the bulbous bow. This larger indentation &#13;
      extends down to the gap at the stempost. There was already a rather deep &#13;
      vertical indentation from a previous occurrence. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 - shows the upper &#13;
      part of the large indentation which looks completely different, although &#13;
      the indentation from below extends into this severely corroded and apparently &#13;
      previously indented area without any coating whatsoever. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 - shows the collapsed &#13;
      stempost area. The stempost was found to have cracked four times - see drawing &#13;
      6 - apparently by fatigue, of which the lower crack penetrated completely &#13;
      some time before the casualty and the lower part, F 3 on the drawing, had &#13;
      disappeared leaving a gap in the stempost respectively a hole in the bottom &#13;
      of the visor. The drawing No. 6 also shows that the INERTA ice paint - last &#13;
      applied in January 1994 - had penetrated the cracks F 1, F 3 and F 4 up &#13;
      to 50% of the thickness of the stempost. This means that the stempost had &#13;
      been cracked through up to 50% already in January 1994. See also Subchapters &#13;
      12.5 and 34.4.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 5.1 - shows the &#13;
      lower forward part of the visor with the deep vertical indentation (arrow &#13;
      2) of old origin, the gap in the stempost area caused by the ice knife on &#13;
      top of the bulbous bow, the small indentation at the starboard side (new) &#13;
      which is apparently casualty related and the large deep indentation at port &#13;
      side (old) which is of old origin and was probably caused by contact with &#13;
      ice.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 7 and 8 - show &#13;
      the bent-off starboard aft part of the bulwark. This damage occurred probably &#13;
      when the visor was hammering on the bow ramp and the ferry was severely &#13;
      heeled to starboard.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 9 and 10 - with &#13;
      drawing (10) incorporated show the visor bottom and arrow 1 points to the &#13;
      indented stempost/bottom plating. The reason for this indentation was the &#13;
      misaligned visor as indicated on the drawing, i.e. the forepart of the visor &#13;
      overlapped the forepart of the forepeak deck to such an extent that the &#13;
      stempost of the visor was no more resting on the stempost of the forecastle &#13;
      deck, but that the stempost part of the forepeak deck was in contact with &#13;
      the bottom plating of the visor which was neither designed nor dimensioned &#13;
      to carry the weight of the visor. Therefore the bottom became firstly indented &#13;
      and subsequently holed.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Evaluation:</b></font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There were &#13;
      2 very heavy damages in the visor which were of old origin and which had &#13;
      led to a change of alignment and geometry of the visor when they occurred &#13;
      which increased during the subsequent time and which has contributed to &#13;
      the casualty.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The large damage &#13;
      to the starboard shell plating was apparently sustained in two stages, viz. &#13;
      at first the corroded upper part occurred and subsequently the larger lower &#13;
      part, which extends into the upper part, occurred. Since it is already rather &#13;
      unlikely that the upper part of the damage did occur during the final stage &#13;
      of the casualty sequence-of-events by contact with the bulbous bow, it can &#13;
      be excluded that the 3 sharp and deep transverse indentations to the port &#13;
      side of the centre line were caused by contact with any part of the bulbous &#13;
      bow because there is no corresponding counter-piece. The picture below shows &#13;
      all the indentations in the forepart of the visor. The arrow indicates the &#13;
      3 horizontal indentations of which the upper and lower ones are rather deep. &#13;
      It has thus to be assumed that the visor had been in contact with some other &#13;
      object either before the casualty scenario began or after it had ended, &#13;
      possibly during the attempts to raise the visor.</font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) At least 2 fatigue &#13;
    cracks had penetrated the stempost already by about 50% when ice paint was &#13;
    applied the last time which was between 10 and 14 January 1994 in the shipyard &#13;
    at Naantali. During the following nine months up to the casualty the cracks &#13;
    had to propagate further and the lowest one did fully penetrate the stempost &#13;
    which led to the breaking away of part F 3 (see drawing below) and the creation &#13;
    of a corresponding hole in the visor bottom and, consequently, the faster &#13;
    flooding of the visor inside at sea.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The visor was &#13;
    misaligned to such an extent that its forepart was overlapping the stempost &#13;
    of the forepeak deck - see drawing behind this page and picture 9 on sheet &#13;
    1 - which had serious consequences for all the relevant parts of the visor &#13;
    such as locking devices, hinges, rubber packings and, last but not least, &#13;
    the weather tightness of the visor. Nothing fitted anymore. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The drawing behind &#13;
    this page summarizes the findings and indicates the condition of the forepeak &#13;
    deck and the lower part of the visor including the lug of the Atlantic lock &#13;
    before departure for the last voyage. </font></p>&#13;

    The webs are of the hp profile-type and measure 160 x 7 mm. The 4 webs at &#13;
    the port side of the aft part - numbered 6 to 9 - were indented to varying &#13;
    extent as can be seen on the picture below. Web 6 was evidently just slightly &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report of the &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Undamaged webs &#13;

      sb side are essentially undamaged, but the paint has been scraped off all &#13;
      of them in a line abt 20 mm down from the ramphouse upper horizontal surface &#13;
      plate (top).<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Web &#13;
      # 5 is already very slightly deflected towards port and measures at 150 &#13;
      mm (against 155, see above). Web # 6 is deflected so that 140 mm remains, &#13;
      # 7 has 100 mm, # 8 has 60 mm and # 9 has 20 mm standing, while the rest &#13;
      of that web has been deflected to port. The depth of damage (deflection) &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage configuration &#13;
    revealed by the above measurements indicates that the visor must have been &#13;
    misaligned by 4°-5° in forward/aft direction if the indenta-tions should have &#13;
    occurred by contact with the bow ramp, i.e. the port side of the visor had &#13;
    to be about 300 mm further forward than the starboard side. In other words, &#13;
    the port side of the visor must have moved forward while the starboard side &#13;
    was held back. Before such forward movement of the visor is possible at all &#13;
    and contact between the aft part of the visor's ramp house and the upper part &#13;
    of the bow ramp is possible, several initially built in obstacles have to &#13;
    be overcome as demonstrated by the drawing on the following page.</font></p>&#13;

    not the ESTONIA scenario because some of the initially built in obstacles &#13;
    were no more in existence, viz. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(g) the visor was &#13;

      capacity was reduced to a fraction of its original value.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore, and due &#13;
    to other circumstances, a casualty scenario as described in Chapter 31 was &#13;
    able to develop which led to the sinking of the ESTONIA and which requires &#13;
    a detailed examination in order to find out what actually caused the indentations &#13;
    to webs 6 - 9 inside the ramp house of the visor.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage &#13;
    is most extensive at web 9 and then decreasing until web 5 which, as well &#13;
    as the starboard side webs 1 - 4, are not affected at all - see picture below. &#13;
    The visor must have been misaligned by ca. 4-5° in relation to the bow ramp &#13;
    being connected to the vessel.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg959.jpg" width="349" height="232"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The arrow indicates &#13;
    the point of contact on web 9. The next frame 5, which is the centre line, &#13;
    and the following frames to starboard have no marks at this level.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that &#13;
    when web 9 came in contact with the port side of the bow ramp and was pressed &#13;
    together from 160 mm to 20 mm the corresponding web 1 at the starboard side &#13;
    of the ramp house was 360 ./. 160 = 200 mm away from the starboard side of &#13;
    the bow ramp. Due to the narrow construction, such a misalignment of the visor &#13;
    is not possible as long as the visor lugs move within the forecastle deck &#13;
    area aft of the deck-beam at frame 159 and as long as both actuators are connected &#13;
    to the B-deck. As will be shown on sheet P 4 + S 4 this was no more the case &#13;
    with the foundation of the port actuator. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also visible &#13;
    on the two pictures above are slight scorings inside the ramp house from web &#13;
    1 through web 9 which could indicate a slight contact at another time, earlier &#13;
    or later (see red arrows on both pictures). The scoring marks are just below &#13;
    the brackets between vertical/horizontal webs which would be the areas of &#13;
    contact when visor and bow ramp are in normal condition as on the drawings. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the points &#13;
    of deepest indentation on webs 6 through 9 are, however, located about 300 &#13;
    mm deeper, this indicates that the visor was at its normal height at the time &#13;
    of this contact, but raised by about this distance in relation to the upper &#13;
    part of the bow ramp. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There is, however, &#13;
    the much more realistic possibility that the port side of the bow ramp came &#13;
    in contact with this particular area inside the ramp house when the visor &#13;
    was hanging on the ramp at a rather late stage of the casualty scenario. Then &#13;
    the vessel was on the side and the visor was close to sliding off the ramp &#13;
    due to the vessel heeling some 120°/130°. This will be explained in Chapter &#13;
    31 - The Casualty Scenario. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper &#13;
    transverse crossbar inside the visor shows respective damage - see arrow 1 &#13;
    on the picture below - the corresponding part at the port outer longitudinal &#13;
    girder of the bow ramp does not. This is confirmed by the image further down, &#13;

    video made on 09.10.94 which shows the port outer girder underside of the &#13;
    bow ramp in way of the contact area with the above-mentioned crossbar. There &#13;
    is no damage, the paint is completely unaffected (the diago-nally running &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is obvious that &#13;
    this quite heavy damage shown on the picture on page 961 was caused by impact &#13;
    - see close-up below - and that this impact did not happen too long ago because &#13;
    the cracked paint is still hanging loose. It cannot have been caused by the &#13;
    ramp, at least not at an early stage as explained before. The damage must &#13;
    have been caused when the visor was labouring on the ramp for more than 30 &#13;
    minutes until the heel of the vessel was sufficiently big to let the visor &#13;
    slide off the ramp. During this time, this and other damage to the </font></p>&#13;

    - arrow 1 on the photo on page 961 - at the starboard side of the same crossbeam &#13;
    in way of the first stringer level are not casualty related because except &#13;
    for the middle one the respective areas cannot be reached by the bow ramp. &#13;
    It has to be assumed that these scorings were caused by other means before &#13;
    the casualty. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The indentations/scorings &#13;
    at the vertical beam are discussed in<b> item 8 - Internal Structure</b>. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the &#13;
    before mentioned the following has been established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There may &#13;
      have been a previous however light contact between visor and bow ramp when &#13;
      both were in normal condition to each other. Such contact could not be explained &#13;
      by this 'Group of Experts', because contact between ramp and ramp house &#13;
      under normal conditions is only possible if the visor hinges are broken &#13;
      or disconnected.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) There has &#13;
      however been a stronger contact between the port side of the bow ramp and &#13;
      the port webs of the ramp house only when the visor was misaligned in relation &#13;
      to the bow ramp by ca. 4°, i.e. the port side of the visor was about 300 &#13;
      mm more forward than the starboard side, a condition which was only possible &#13;
      after the hinges had failed and the lugs under-neath the visor arms had &#13;
      broken through the deck beam at frame 159. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) This is supported &#13;
      by the apparent fact that the bow ramp was not locked and the visor was &#13;
      water-filled to the outboard level and was weighing about 200 ts, instead &#13;
      of 55 ts in empty condition. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The bow ramp &#13;
      did not crash into the visor onto the cross-beam at 1st stringer level and &#13;
      did not cause the respective damage on port side because neither the corresponding &#13;
      part of the bow ramp nor the corresponding part of the starboard side of &#13;
      the same cross-beam do show any damage of similar nature. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Consequently &#13;
      the bow ramp was not pulled open when the contact occurred which caused &#13;
      the indentations/scorings to the four port webs in the aft part of the ramp &#13;
      house. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It has however &#13;
      to be assumed that this contact occurred in the final stage when the visor &#13;
      separated from the vessel and the bow ramp was kicked up by the port aft &#13;
      bottom part of the visor as it will be explained in Chapter 31 - The Casualty &#13;
      Scenario. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally attention &#13;
    has to be drawn to one indentation pushed at each side into the forward deck &#13;
    beam of the visor, i.e. the lower side of the forward part of the ramp house &#13;
    as indicated on the two pictures on the next page. According to drawing on &#13;
    page 956 the port indentation is 240 mm away from the inner bulkhead and the &#13;
    starboard one 325 m. This means that these indentations were most probably &#13;
    caused by the bell cranks being the most upwards extending parts of the bow &#13;
    ramp. This must have occurred at a time when the visor was hanging on the &#13;
    bow ramp already, i.e. the contact area having been the part inner bulkhead. &#13;
    Therefore the distance between bow ramp and port inner bulkhead has as small &#13;
    as possible - 240 mm - while the opposite distance between the bow ramp and &#13;
    the starboard inner bulkhead was as big as possible - 325 mm. This is also &#13;
    the explanation for the apparent fact that the port inner bulkhead was very &#13;
    severely distorted and partly cracked while the starboard inner bulkhead remained &#13;
    completely unaffected even without paint scratches. See also S 4 and P4 - &#13;
    The Inner Bulkheads - further down.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The hinges were &#13;
    gross negligently repaired by burning out the old bushings and replacing them &#13;

    of up to 25 mm between hinge plate and steel bushing.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The hinge plates &#13;
    inside were covered by deep burning marks from which cracks had propagated &#13;
    the material very deeply. Thereby the load carrying capacity was reduced to &#13;
    20% or less of the original strength. See also Subchapter 34.4. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Due to the extent &#13;

    after 10-12 years. </font></p>&#13;

    the inside of the bronze bushing with deep scorings. Upon inspection it was &#13;
    ascertained that these scorings were extending over about 180°, although the &#13;
    bolt should move inside the (shrinked) fixed bushing only over 90° in accordance &#13;
    with the movement of the visor. This means that the bronze bushing which should &#13;
    be fixed inside the steel bushing had been turning, i.e. had not been sufficiently &#13;
    fixed inside the steel bushing during the installation of new steel and bronze &#13;
    bushings. </font></p>&#13;

      steel and bronze bushings as well as the securing plate are not original. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The welding &#13;
      seams between visor hinge plate and steel bushing are consequently also &#13;
      not original which is also confirmed by the weak dimensions.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The welding &#13;
      seams were cracked and an attempt had been made to close the cracks by welding &#13;
      which resulted in welding material penetrating through the crack into the &#13;
      much too big gap between the hinge plate and steel bushing.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The space &#13;
      between the hinge plate and steel bushing shows heavy corrosion which indicates &#13;
      that the welding seams had been cracked and penetrated some considerable &#13;
      time before the casualty and, consequently, the much too big space between &#13;
      hinge plate and steel bushing was exposed to the outside air and wetness.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The inside &#13;
      of the hinge plate was covered by deep burning marks whereas the outer surface &#13;
      of the steel bushing was unaffected. Consequently the old steel bushing &#13;
      had been burned out by flame-cutting. Each burning mark is a crack starter &#13;
      from where cracks propagated into the hinge plate material to various depth. &#13;
      This led to further weakening of the hinges and to a considerable reduction &#13;
      of the load carrying capacity. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) Also the bronze &#13;
      bushing was installed rather unprofessionally and not shrunk in as it was &#13;
      done at newbuilding. - See the statements of G.Todsen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

    evident that at the starboard hinge plates there is about 15 mm less material &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that the &#13;
    distance between the 2 arrows above was 15 mm smaller at the starboard hinges &#13;
    compared to the port hinges. This was certainly one of the reasons why the &#13;
    starboard hinges broke first and the port hinges were holding for some time &#13;

      deck. The port hammering mark is directly adjacent to the outer hinge plate &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following facts &#13;
      are considered to be established:</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer &#13;
      lug plate is completely untouched while the inner lug plate shows very deeply &#13;
      engraved scraping marks. This means that at the time when the lug plates &#13;
      were cutting through the deck plating and the deck beam the vessel must &#13;
      have heeled already considerably to starboard. Therefore the centre of gravity &#13;
      of the visor had shifted from forward to starboard and the force direction &#13;
      was no more to forward/downwards but starboard/downwards. Thus the weight &#13;
      of the visor in athwartships direction was now carried by the inner port &#13;
      and the outer starboard lug plates because the locating horns gave no more &#13;
      transverse support as the visor had moved too much forward.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) As the lug &#13;
      plates underneath the starboard visor arm were both badly affected, the &#13;
      outside more than the inside, it must be assumed that the starboard hinges &#13;
      failed first. At that time the vessel was only slightly heeling to starboard &#13;
      but rolling and consequently both the inner and the outer hinge plates were &#13;
      affected. The port hinges remained intact for the time being. The starboard &#13;
      side of the visor moved - in slightly raised condition - forward/aft a couple &#13;
      of times when the vessel was still only slightly heeling to starboard and &#13;
      was rolling, whereafter the starboard heel increased considerably and also &#13;
      the port hinges broke. Only thereafter also the port lug plate started to &#13;
      cut first through the deck plating and then through the deck beams. At that &#13;
      time the heel to starboard must have been that big already that the outer &#13;
      port lug plate did not come in contact with the steel parts cut through &#13;
      by the forward parts of both lug plates - see the picture above. </font></p>&#13;

    Thereafter the actuator remained in this position until being dismounted by &#13;

    the above visible indentations, scraping and scoring marks have been caused &#13;
    when the visor was hanging on the bow ramp. See also Subchapter 29.2 - The &#13;

    the casualty since parts of the welding seam were found to be cracked with &#13;
    oil inside the cracks. According to the observations of truck driver Per-Arne &#13;

    i.e. from port to starboard. Arrow 5 points to the remains of the B-deck, &#13;
    to which the port outer stiffener (arrow 4) is still welded. In the forward &#13;

    by the welding seams (green paint) remained with the actuator foundation. &#13;
    The deck as well as the stiffener were pre-damaged - see Subchapter 34.4 - &#13;
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/30.417.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 30.417</a> &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the relatively &#13;
    straight cracks (7) directly below the forward and aft parts of the lug plates, &#13;
    it has to be assumed that the stiffeners in way were affected by fatigue cracks. &#13;
    The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty &#13;
    due to load changes during opening/closing of the visor and did most probably &#13;
    propagate more quickly during the last month before the casualty because of &#13;
    the increasing difficulties with the visor, especially with the port side. &#13;
    See Subchapter 12.4 / 12.5. The following drawing demonstrates the above.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it is obvious &#13;
    from the close-ups below, the stiffener (3) was hardly spot-welded and thus &#13;
    only slightly connected with the B-deck. As this part of the stiffener is &#13;
    not painted at all - see the next photo to which the reader looks on the port &#13;
    inner lug plate from starboard to port - it is no more original, i.e. has &#13;
    been installed subsequently when the vessel was trading already. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following photograph &#13;
    shows the port visor actuator foundation after parts had been cut out for &#13;
    testing purposes. The foundation lies on its port outer lug plate. In the &#13;
    front the port outer stiffener (4) is visible, which is fully welded to the &#13;
    B-deck (5). Further at the forward right corner the old temporary repair with &#13;
    the very poor welding seams (6) is visible from inside. For cutting purposes &#13;
    the port inner stiffener (3) had been removed. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent fact &#13;
    that this stiffener (3) had been disconnected from the B-deck (5) respectively &#13;
    since the last repair was never really fitted to it, is further confirmed &#13;
    by a part of the welding seam - see arrow 8 - on the previous two photos - &#13;
    apparently being soaked with oil while the stiffener below is unaffected. &#13;
    This means that this stiffener was not welded to the B-deck.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the &#13;
    following facts are considered to be established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer &#13;
      stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old temporary repair &#13;
      with very poor welding seems in its forward part. Due to the corrosion visible &#13;
      on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this improper repair was &#13;
      carried out already some considerable time before the casualty. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The stiffeners &#13;
      show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward and the aft ends &#13;
      of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the stiffeners &#13;
      were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. The cracks had developed &#13;
      during some considerable time before the casualty due to load changes during &#13;
      the opening and closing of the visor. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The B-deck &#13;
      was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the stiffeners. This &#13;
      fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck remains. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The port inner &#13;
      stiffener was no more the original one since firstly it did not show any &#13;
      protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded to the deck - if at &#13;
      all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the deck by the shipyard &#13;
      during new-building, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The load carrying &#13;
      capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably reduced. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There is, however, &#13;
    another remarkable difference between the condition of the port and starboard &#13;
    actuators, viz.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- MacGregor, &#13;
    Turku has examined the port actuator upon instructions of the JAIC and found &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that it &#13;
    was tried manually to hold the visor down by hydraulic pressure on the piston &#13;

    - see picture above. The piston rod shows some scoring marks but no particular &#13;
    damage, certainly no heavy damages on the starboard side as can be seen on &#13;
    the piston rod of the port actuator. The scoring marks on the piston rod may &#13;
    have been caused at any time during the long process of separation from the &#13;
    vessel. This does not allow the conclusion that the lifting cylinder had been &#13;
    opened when the actuator was still attached to B-deck, i.e. that the visor &#13;
    opened to some extent, although this has to be assumed because of the unaffected &#13;
    rubber packings around the actuator opening - see above. </font></p>&#13;

      likely because the crew was trying to hold down the visor by the actuators &#13;
      but the port one broke off due to the poor connection to B-deck.</font></p>&#13;

      moving visor, the cylinder cover with hexagon screws on the piston rod side &#13;
      being the thickest part with direct contact to bulkhead and internals during &#13;
      the breaking through process. Therefore cover and screws show severe hammering &#13;
      marks and the clamping ring is missing which was probably stripped off the &#13;
      piston when it was pulled through the bulkhead. Also the damage picture &#13;
      of the port front bulkhead - see P 4 in Chapter 29 - does confirm the above &#13;
      because only a metal strip with the approximate breadth of the actuator &#13;
      was clearly cut out of the bulkhead plating and rolled together at the lower &#13;
      end. </font></p>&#13;

      this was not the case with the <b>starboard actuator</b>, viz. piston cover &#13;
      and hexagon screws show no sign of hammering or any other damage, the clamping &#13;
      ring is in place, the actuator hardly scored. Obviously<b> this piston had &#13;
      not been pulled through the starboard front bulkhead when it was still intact, &#13;
      but when the actuator was pulled through the front bulkhead by the forward &#13;
      moving visor this bulkhead was already open - see Chapter 32 - and therefore &#13;
      the actuator could easily slip through the wide opening - see also Chapter &#13;
      29 - S 4.</b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The piston &#13;
      rod of the port actuator shows severe damage on the starboard side at an &#13;
      opening stage of about 400 mm which indicates that vessel and visor were &#13;
      heeled to starboard when the piston rod was extended by 400 mm. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) Similar damage &#13;
      cannot be traced at the piston rod of the starboard actuator. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The foundation &#13;
      of the port actuator had been temporarily repaired in a poor and unprofessional &#13;
      way without informing, thus without approval, of the class. It was furthermore &#13;
      cut off B-deck at some time before the casualty and apparently refitted &#13;
      improperly to B-deck which explains its early failure.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (8) The foundation &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According &#13;
    to the observations of previous passengers, for example truck driver Torbjörn &#13;
    Cederqvist - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.157.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.3.157</a> - Subchapter 12.4 - both lugs had frequently been burned off &#13;
    when the crew was unable to open the side locks hydraulically upon arrival &#13;
    in Tallinn. Obviously they were subsequently rewelded to the same location. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is also obvious &#13;
    from the condition of the starboard lug as can be seen from the two video &#13;
    images of the corresponding lug still attached to the bolt on the wreck that &#13;
    the lugs had been repeatedly cut off and rewelded. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg1011.jpg" width="347" height="237"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The very thick welding &#13;
    seam on the lower part - see arrow 1 - is actually a build-up of several welding &#13;
    seams, i.e. weld on top of the previous weld without grinding away of the &#13;
    remnants. It is obvious that the bulkhead part attached to the lug - see arrow &#13;
    2 - had not been torn out of the bulkhead during the casualty scenario but &#13;
    much earlier because, due to the thickness of the accumulated welding seams, &#13;
    this original part of the visor bulkhead (Viking Line colour) could not come &#13;
    in contact with the adjacent visor plating. Consequently, it has to be assumed &#13;
    that each time the lug was cut off by burning it was just stuck into the respective &#13;
    hole in the bulkhead and welded from both sides, if at all - see also Chapter &#13;
    29 - S 4.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next pictures &#13;
    - also taken from the JAIC's Report - show the upper parts of the holes in &#13;
    the visor bulkheads where the lugs had been fitted.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg1012.jpg" width="346" height="228"/></font> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The analysis and &#13;
    comparison of both pictures reveal the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The plating &#13;
      around <b>the port</b> holes is unaffected. Some remains of welding seams &#13;
      are visible at the upper right corner and at the right (inside) there are &#13;
      indications that welding seams could have been there. At the outside (left &#13;
      side) there are no such indications which refers also to the upper hole. &#13;
      Only few spots of corrosion can be seen. In summary it has to be assumed &#13;
      that the lug had not or only to a very limited extent been welded from the &#13;
      outside. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The plating &#13;
      around<b> the starboard</b> opening looks completely different because the &#13;
      plating is distorted, the stiffener at the inside is torn off the bulkhead, &#13;
      the plating had apparently been exposed to heat and subsequently became &#13;
      corroded. The steel part between the small hole and the bigger opening was &#13;
      pushed upwards, obviously by the lug then and still attached to the vessel, &#13;
      i.e. the visor made a downward movement in relation to the lug, i.e. the &#13;
      vessel. Thereby the lug was pressed into said steel part. The indication &#13;
      of the remnant of a welding seam is visible at the upper right corner of &#13;
      the big opening. Otherwise there are no indications of welding seams at &#13;
      all. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lugs of &#13;
      the visor's side locks were obviously not welded to the plating, but there &#13;
      were permanent holes in the plating of both sides through which the lugs &#13;
      were stuck and welded from the inside only. Thereby it was possible to adjust &#13;
      the part of the lugs extending the plating to the length required by the &#13;
      ever changing misalignment of the visor. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The discussion of &#13;
    the pictures on Sheet S 5 is continued: </font></p>&#13;

    hinges were broken and the vessel already had a starboard list.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, attention &#13;
    has to be drawn to both aft parts of the visor deck shown on the two pictures &#13;
    overleaf. The corroded areas indicated by arrow 1 on both sides have been &#13;
    the spots where the visor had been welded to the vessel at the time when the &#13;
    bushings of the starboard visor hinges were renewed. This was the time when &#13;
    ESTONIA berthed in Tallinn stern first - see the statement of Torbjörn Cederqvist &#13;
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.157.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 12.4.3.157</a> &#13;
    and Subchapter 12.4.3 - the cars left the ferry via the stern ramps instead &#13;
    of the bow ramp as it is normally the case in Tallinn. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Arrows 2 on both &#13;
    sides indicate the corner between visor deck/aft bulkhead and visor arms along &#13;
    which the rope was running by which the bow ramp was kept close as tight as &#13;
    possible. The drawing below show the forecastle deck with the two winch drums &#13;
    by which the rope was heaved tight and the two fairleads around which the &#13;
    rope was running. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently the &#13;
    following facts are considered to have been established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The lug of &#13;
      the hydraulic side lock had been cut off and rewelded only from the inside &#13;
      several times without grinding off the remnants of the previous welding &#13;
      seams. This led to a build-up of thick welding seams, which reduced the &#13;
      load carrying capacity of this lock to a fraction of the original.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The plating &#13;
      around the pocket for the locating horn was unaffected. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The area around &#13;
      the lug of the side lock was pushed out, is distorted and was exposed to &#13;
      heat.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The area between &#13;
      the initial lug location and the bent hooks show intense smoke marks. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The lug separated &#13;
      from the visor bulkhead when the visor was in a forward/downward movement.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (6) The hooks &#13;
      were crushed together in such a way which cannot be explained mechanically.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (7) The bottom &#13;
      end of the aft bulkhead is partly crushed, partly torn and on the outside &#13;
      a deep fold in way of the contact area with the rubber packings of the corresponding &#13;
      front bulkhead of the vessel extends from the area of the lug down to the &#13;
      bottom area. - See the right picture on the next page. The corresponding &#13;
      area on the lower part of the port aft bulkhead of the visor, as can be &#13;
      seen on the left picture on the next page, is apparently undamaged.</font></p>&#13;

    neither hydraulically nor by force - see Subchapter 12.4 - and then the next &#13;
    step was to take the burning gear and cut off the lug. Subsequently the lug &#13;
    was rewelded time and again and apparently only from the inside of the visor &#13;

    the next page shows the lower port aft bulkhead. It becomes evident that the &#13;
    area below the pocket for the locating horn does not show any rubbing marks &#13;
    - contrary to the starboard side - which leads to the conclusion that the &#13;

    on the visor from port to starboard, which is a further indication for the &#13;
    severe misalignment of the visor.<br/>&#13;
    Arrow 3 indicates a damage apparently caused when the visor fell off the bow &#13;
    ramp in the final stage when the heel of the vessel was already 120°/130° &#13;

    1 and the arrows 1 and 2 on the close-up - picture 2 - which were discussed &#13;
    already at the beginning of Sheet P 5. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Evidently something &#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following facts &#13;
    are considered to be established:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Due to the &#13;
      vertical misalignment of the visor the port side of the visor was raised &#13;
      by 100 or more mm which made it impossible for the locating horn fitted &#13;
      at the port front bulkhead of the vessel to enter the mating pocket of the &#13;
      visor. Instead contact occurred in the area below the pocket - as the visor &#13;
      was raised - and the plating became damaged.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The crew fitted &#13;
      several doublers and support brackets in way to compensate for the stress &#13;
      created by the misalignment. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lug of &#13;
      the hydraulic side lock including the plating part to which it was welded &#13;
      had apparently been cut off and rewelded several times without grinding &#13;
      off the remnants of the previous welding seams. This led to the very thick &#13;
      welds with substantially reduced load carrying capacity of the side locking &#13;
      device of the visor. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The rubber &#13;
      packings in way of the area below the pockets for the locating horn were &#13;
      either missing at the front bulkhead of the vessel or had not been in contact &#13;
      with the corresponding parts of the visor bulkhead due to misalignment. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The area around &#13;
      the location of the lug of the hydraulic side lock is not pushed out, nor &#13;
      do smoke marks exist. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The hooks of &#13;
      the manual side lock are just slightly bent together. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The recess &#13;
      at the upper part of the port aft bulkhead of the visor was damaged when &#13;
      the visor was moving transversely respectively athwartships. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(8) The lower part &#13;
      of the aft bulkhead is not affected.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (9) The plating &#13;
      between forecastle deck and visor arm is cracked and the steel pads protecting &#13;
      the rubber packings were hammered flat by crew members attempting to lower &#13;
      down the port side of the visor which was extending the forecastle deck &#13;
      of the vessel by 100 mm or more. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the opinion of &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' the bottom had been held back by the Atlantic lock &#13;
    until it finally also broke when the visor fell to starboard until it rested &#13;
    on the bow ramp. - See Chapter 31. - It is also obvious that the visor had &#13;
    overlapped the forepeak deck considerably to the effect that the forepeak &#13;
    deck had penetrated the inside of the visor bottom up to ca. 0.5 m. This must &#13;
    have given the visor the main support against falling off to starboard, because &#13;
    the bow ramp alone could not have carried the entire weight of the visor after &#13;
    the Atlantic lock had failed. - See Subchapter 34.5. - The damage picture &#13;
    of the strong ice strengthened hull plates on both sides of the collapsed &#13;
    stempost do confirm the above. See arrow 2 and also Chapter 31 - The Casualty &#13;

    of the pocket for the locating horn on the forepeak deck - the pyramid - with &#13;
    contact marks of different depth at port and starboard side - see arrows 5/6. &#13;
    The scoring marks enlarged on picture 8 indicate visor movements from starboard &#13;
    forward to port aft whereby the pyramid only came in contact with the aft &#13;
    half of the pocket due to the extensive misalignment of the visor as demonstrated &#13;
    by the detail drawing D1 - on Sheet 6. </font></p>&#13;

    bow. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 - shows a very &#13;
    sharp damage to the port aft edge of the visor bottom which probably occurred &#13;
    due to contact with the bow ramp when the visor moved transversely, i.e. athwartships &#13;
    in the final stage of gliding off the bow ramp and forepeak deck. - See also &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 - shows the visor &#13;
    lug being part of the Atlantic lock. Arrow 1 points to the previously burnt &#13;
    off part of the lug with cracks propagating from burning marks (arrow 2). &#13;
    The lug apparently became twisted to starboard when the visor moved abruptly &#13;
    to starboard until its port inner bulkhead rested on the port side of the &#13;
    bow ramp. The deep crack in the bottom of the visor to port of the lug confirms &#13;
    this. It further indicates that the visor lug was about to crack off the visor &#13;
    bottom when the lugs on the forepeak deck failed first. This is underlined &#13;
    by the impressive picture below indicating an upwards and to starboard movement &#13;
    of the visor when this big crack propagated and came to a stop when the lugs &#13;
    on the forepeak deck failed. </font></p>&#13;

      bottom structure of the visor which supported the visor during the increasing &#13;
      heel of the vessel.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The gap in &#13;
      way of the collapsed stempost of the visor was caused when this part fell &#13;
      on top of the ice knife on top of the bulbous bow. The very strong ice plates &#13;
      consequently bent up to both sides of the collapsed stempost provided further &#13;
      support to the visor and also prevented its falling off to starboard. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The scoring/scraping &#13;
      marks inside the pocket for the pyramid do confirm the vertical and forward/aft &#13;
      misalignment of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The very sharp &#13;
      damage at the port aft edge of the visor bottom was caused when the visor &#13;
      moved athwartships in the final stage of gliding off the bow ramp, the forepeak &#13;
      deck and finally the bulbous bow to the bottom of the sea. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The visor lug &#13;
      of the Atlantic lock almost cracked off at the bottom when the visor moved &#13;
      forwards and to starboard, however, then the lugs of the forepeak deck broke &#13;
      first and the crack propagation stopped. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The visor lug &#13;
      was considerably elongated due to wear in 141/2 years of exposure to changing &#13;
      loads and the manipulations by Christer Koivisto.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (7) The basic &#13;
      primer of the visor lug is yellow which is an indication that it is still &#13;
      the original lug as the initial primer at newbuilding was of such colour. &#13;
      See also Subchapter 2.4.6. The basic primer of the starboard lug of the &#13;
      Atlantic lock was found to be grey by the JAIC which is a further confirmation &#13;
      that this as well as the other two lugs were not the original ones anymore. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(8) The stempost was cracked &#13;
      4 times well before the casualty and the crack had penetrated the stempost &#13;
      up to 50% of its thickness at the time of the casualty. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious &#13;
    that these deep indentations cannot have been caused when the port actuator &#13;
    was swinging inside the longitudinal inner bulkhead (due to the existing starboard &#13;
    list of visor and vessel) and got jammed there, as evident from the picture &#13;
    below. </font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the actuator &#13;
    had been dismounted by MacGregor, Turku in February 1995 the area looked as &#13;
    it is shown by the following picture. Arrow 1 indicates the area at the edge &#13;
    of aft and inner bulkheads where the aft bulkhead is slightly extending the &#13;
    inner bulkhead and where metal parts were torn off when the actuator moved &#13;
    into its jammed positions. A detailed evaluation of this and other pictures &#13;
    did reveal that neither the actuator nor its foundation had come in contact &#13;
    with the bulkhead which is due to the angle between the fastening point at &#13;
    the lugs below the visor arm and the bulkhead edge. The actuator was able &#13;
    to swing into this position because of its spherical bearings which allow &#13;
    deviation of up to 15° to each side. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is thus proven &#13;
    with sufficient certainty that the severe damage as well as the scraping and &#13;
    scoring marks were only caused by the bow ramp then lying inside the visor &#13;
    on the beam structure and the visor resting on the bow ramp in way of the &#13;
    damage area under discussion. This shall be explained in more detail in Chapter &#13;
    31 - The Casualty Scenario. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The picture below &#13;

    (arrow 2) are restricted to the middle part, and, in the foreground, the vertical &#13;
    beam which had been in contact with the upper part of the ramp with the folded &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The above-mentioned &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The opposite &#13;

      has been no contact with the bow ramp.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The above &#13;
      explained severe damage at the port inner longitudinal bulkhead in connection &#13;
      with corresponding damage at the port bow ramp - see Subchapter 29.2 - The &#13;
      Bow Area - and witness evidence - see Enclosures 29.6.414 / 29.6.415 - confirms &#13;
      that the visor had been resting on the bow ramp which caused the damage &#13;
      to the port inner bulkhead. </font></p>&#13;

    have been caused by the bow ramp at the early stage, because there is no corresponding &#13;
    damage at the ramp and, also, the lower parts, being almost at the underside &#13;

    for these marks respectively damage on the cross-beam on both sides can be &#13;
    seen on the drawing 3., i.e. contact with the bell cranks on both sides at &#13;
    the top of the ramp already before the casualty when the visor opened/closed &#13;
    due to the slightly open and misaligned ramp (could no more be properly closed) &#13;
    and the misaligned visor. In particular the port bell crank is damaged very &#13;
    severely which was, of course, mainly caused by the contact with the port &#13;
    inner bulkhead of the visor. On the other hand, it has to be assumed that &#13;
    this already existing damage was exaggerated when the ramp was inside the &#13;
    visor and the visor hanging on the ramp.</font></p>&#13;

    inside of the visor with the lower transverse beam in way of the 3rd stringer. &#13;
    This beam was found to be very severely scored and scraped, which was most &#13;
    probably caused during the lifting operation. The picture also demonstrate &#13;
    the very severely set up visor bottom which is underlined by the close-up &#13;
    No. 10 and explained by detail drawing No. 8. There are two further contact &#13;
    marks in way of the deck beam at the lower forward part of the ramp house, &#13;
    viz. in the most port and most starboard frame spaces, which were evidently &#13;
    also caused by the bell cranks of the ramp when the visor moved further forward &#13;
    and downwards and the vessel was already severely heeled to starboard already. &#13;

      by the bow ramp, because there was no corresponding damage at the ramp. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;

      on the port side of the upper cross-beam and the scraping marks on the starboard &#13;

      fitted on both sides at the top of the bow ramp. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The damage &#13;

      beam as well as parts of both sides of the 2nd stringer and the adjacent &#13;
      frames are thickly covered with hydraulic oil. It has not been possible &#13;
      so far to verify from where this oil originates and what caused this quite &#13;

      bulkhead than the starboard one indicating that the contacts occurred when &#13;
      the visor was heeled to starboard and resting on the bow ramp. The contacts &#13;
      occurred with the bell cranks of the bow ramp when the bow ramp was pushed &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The visor's &#13;
      fore part had been lower than the aft part since some considerable time &#13;
      before the casualty which is another confirmation for the severe and increasing &#13;
      misalignment and deformation of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The port area &#13;
      of the 3rd stringer was severely set up with the frames buckled since some &#13;
      time before the casualty probably the ice winter 1994 when the vessel frequently &#13;
      forced ice. This damage extended up to the 2nd stringer and into the adjacent &#13;
      frames and brackets.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The visor &#13;
      had always been full of water to the outside level when the vessel was at &#13;
      sea. See the photo below.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The hydraulic &#13;
      cylinders/pipes were leaking which caused hydraulic oil to swim on the water &#13;

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) People had &#13;
      been very active inside the visor, in particular on the 3rd stringer. The &#13;

      from the time before arrival and after departure Tallinn on September 27, &#13;

    the bolt of the Atlantic lock had been hammered by crewmembers through the &#13;
    3 bent and misaligned lugs on the forepeak deck - see the footprints in the &#13;
    visor on Sheet 9 - Chapter 30 - the ferry quickly picked up speed when she &#13;
    followed the westbound lane in the TSS between the island Nayssaar and the &#13;
    mainland. Due to the missing and/or defect rubber packings on the forepeak &#13;
    deck - see Sheet 7 in Chapter 29.2 - the inside of the visor quickly filled &#13;
    with water to the outer level. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water level &#13;
    inside the visor was raising the deeper the bow was pitching into the waves &#13;
    coming in from port forward. Simultaneously water penetrated to the car deck &#13;
    at the port lower side of the bow ramp in spite of the "sealing material" &#13;
    stuffed into the big gap by the crew. - See drawings on the following page &#13;

    of the TSS off Suurupi Lighthouse the course was changed to 262° and the ferry &#13;
    proceeded with all 4 main engines on full output along the Estonian North &#13;
    coast. Due to the increasing south-westerly gale the ferry heeled 2-4° to &#13;
    starboard and was pitching harder and harder. - See Chapter 30. Passengers &#13;

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even with &#13;
    calm sea the water level inside the visor was rising above the 3rd stringer<br/>&#13;
    when the vessel was at full speed. The lower side of the bow ramp was below<br/>&#13;
    3rd stringer level, thus even in clam sea the water from the visor was penetrating<br/>&#13;
    the gap in the bow ramp and was flooding onte the car deck.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of &#13;
    the following 1 - 1,5 hours the bow was diving increasingly deeper into the &#13;
    wave troughs and finally the foreship was shipping green water onto the forecastle &#13;
    deck. Therefore, it has to be assumed that the visor had been filled up with &#13;
    water up to the 1st stringer level or even higher. This means that the weight &#13;
    of the visor increased from 55 ts to approximately 200 ts which had, among &#13;
    other things, the effect that the 0,5 m stern trim might have been reduced.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the &#13;
    high water column inside the visor and the respective pressure on the unsecured &#13;
    ramp the port lower corner of which being plugged with "sealing material" &#13;
    the water quantities penetrating the gaps and streaming onto the car deck &#13;
    were increasing and accumulating at starboard to which side the vessel was &#13;
    continuously heeling since departure the scuppers at the starboard side being &#13;
    most likely unable to swallow all the water streaming into the car deck. To &#13;
    avoid the worst the crew seems to have opened the starboard stern ramp slightly &#13;
    and have kept it in such condition by means of the ice braking cylinders against &#13;
    which the ramp was pressed by the actuators to maintain the gap through which &#13;
    water was flowing from the car deck. The resulting high pitch hydraulic noise &#13;
    created by the aft hydraulic pumps disturbed the conference held on the 4th &#13;
    deck above to such an effect that it had to be closed down at about 20.45 &#13;
    hours. -See the statement of Rolf Sörman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A little later the &#13;
    stabilisers were activated from the bridge, but it appeared that the starboard &#13;
    one did not move out of its pocket which was located about midships on 0-deck &#13;
    level. Sometime later the crew seems to have started to work on that stabiliser &#13;
    and have tried to hammer it out by means of sledge hammers. See the statement &#13;
    of Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.2.151.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about 00.40/45 &#13;
    hours 1-2 heavy bangs, crashed were felt when the watchman A. B. Silver Linde &#13;
    came again to the car deck and must have seen big quantities of water moving &#13;
    between the cars and trucks, with personal cars already floating around in &#13;
    the forepart of the deck. Due to the heavily and hard labouring vessel there &#13;
    must have been heavy movement of the water.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Silver Linde alarmed &#13;
    the bridge at once by walkie-talkie shouting that there was much more water &#13;
    on the car deck and they had to leave the vessel. This was overheard by safety &#13;
    officer Ervin Roden, who had his walkie-talkie switched on when he was in &#13;
    his cabin - see statement of Paula Liikamaa <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.352.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    21.3.4.352.</a> The watch officer certainly informed the master who most likely &#13;
    told him to send the boatswain with some deckhands down to try to rectify &#13;
    the situation. Most likely the chief mate and the chief engineer were also &#13;
    called to the bridge and the 2nd mate Peeter Kannuussaar sent down to the &#13;
    car deck as well, which would be the normal procedure.</font></p>&#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the very weak &#13;
    condition of visor and bow ramp were with certainty known to the vessel's &#13;
    command, the speed was reduced and the bow slowly turned to starboard in an &#13;
    attempt to reduce the load on the visor and to avoid green water on to the &#13;
    forecastle deck, because crew members had to work also there and had to enter &#13;
    the port side house from there as it was certainly not possible to reach the &#13;
    control panel from the centre casing. It was necessary for crew members to &#13;
    get to the forward port side of the car deck to the control panel to activate &#13;
    the hydraulic pumps in order to close the bow ramp best terms possible and &#13;
    probably also to hold the visor down hydraulically. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel made slower &#13;
    but deeper pitch movements due to the speed reduction, but the rolling increased &#13;
    dangerously when the vessel got into or almost into beam seas. To reduce the &#13;
    rolling the ferry was turned back to port. The vessel was again in head seas, &#13;
    the heavy rolling stopped, but the deep pitch movements increased again and &#13;
    green water was taken on the forecastle, whereafter the crew had to abandon &#13;
    their attempts to close the bow ramp by heaving the mooring line. The bow &#13;
    ramp was then held by the actuators which, however, could only close the ramp &#13;
    to a final opening of about 5 cm. Thus water continued to stream onto the &#13;
    car deck and there was nothing the crew could do about it. It has to be assumed &#13;
    that the nautical advisor, Captain Juri Aavik, was also on the car deck/on &#13;
    the forecastle deck doing his utmost to get the situation under control, however &#13;
    in vain. It has further to be assumed that the 2nd mate and/or the boatswain &#13;
    informed the bridge continuously about the situation on the car deck. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Simultaneously the &#13;
    engine crew was working on the starboard stabiliser fin and sledge hammer &#13;
    noises were heard all the time. A further consequence of the vessel pitching &#13;
    against high seas from forward was the load increase on the visor attachments &#13;
    which had already been increased by about 150 ts of water moving forward/aft &#13;
    and side to side inside the visor. This caused the failure of the starboard &#13;
    visor hinge followed by the failure of the starboard side lock of the visor. &#13;
    - See the drawings on page 1062. Both components were considerably pre-damaged &#13;
    - see Subchapters 12.4.3/12.5 and Chapters 29/30 - and the load carrying capacity &#13;
    was substantially reduced. See also Subchapter 34.4. The Atlantic lock remained &#13;
    intact for the time being.</font></p>&#13;

    crew members went on the forecastle deck through the door on deck 5 and</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">tried &#13;

    of the visor was 5-7 cm moving forward/aft between the deck beam at frame &#13;
    159 and the hinge parts on forecastle deck which created the heavy metallic &#13;
    banging noises scaring many passengers. The lug plates underneath the starboard &#13;
    visor arm came in contact with the adjacent plating and sustained scoring &#13;
    marks on the inside and on the outside because the vessel was only slightly &#13;
    heeled to starboard, still pitching in head seas and only slightly rolling. &#13;
    The port visor hinges remained intact for the time being.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the disappearing &#13;
    hydraulic pressure the bow ramp was lowering down into the visor and was resting &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The now prevailing &#13;
    situation is illustrated by the drawings on the following pages. The dynamic &#13;
    forces created by the deep pitch movements of the vessel in combination with &#13;
    the movement of the big water quantity inside the visor and the weight of &#13;
    the visor finally resulted in the lug plates underneath the visor arm to cut &#13;
    through the deck beam at frame 159. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In April 1995 the &#13;
    JAIC published the <i>"PART-Report covering technical issues on the capsizing &#13;
    on 28 September 1994 in the Baltic Sea of the ro-ro passenger vessel MV Estonia" &#13;
    </i>which included also certain picture material, among others the picture &#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The blue coloured &#13;
    part of the lug - see arrow - looked as if having been exposed to heat which &#13;
    was unusual since this part had been below water. The JAIC was contacted and &#13;
    it turned out that samples had been taken already on 25 November 1994 and &#13;
    had been examined upon request of the Central Criminal Police in Finland and &#13;
    Kari Lethola as chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC on 30.03.95. The &#13;
    tests were carried out on 30.05.95 by the Criminal Laboratory Technical Division, &#13;
    Helsinki. The "available" documentation was received - already translated &#13;
    into English - from Kari Lethola.</font></p>&#13;

    of the methods applied by the laboratory when the objects have been under &#13;
    water for more than one week. It would, even today and in 20 years time, be &#13;
    possible to prove explosion damage by scientific methods by means of which &#13;
    the destroyed molecular structure is examined. This, however, was not done &#13;

    In sample No. 7 were paint splinters with paint layer structure that was different &#13;
    from the bow mentioned because lots of grey and blue epox paint had been rubbed &#13;
    on the top white paint layer. This epox paint was when it comes to the pigment &#13;
    and the component type to its chemical structure of the same type as the Inerta &#13;

    only known activities in connection with explosives which were incurred by &#13;
    the Authorities involved in the casualty investigation. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No further information &#13;
    relating to explosives having possibly been on board the ESTONIA on her last &#13;
    voyage were received until approximately mid 1996 when rumours were circulating &#13;
    that there was a big hole in the starboard side of the hull in way of sauna &#13;
    and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck. The information came at first from &#13;
    some source in the upper middle management of Sjöfartsverket. A check of the &#13;
    available video material - see Chapters 25-28 - revealed that the respective &#13;
    parts on all video tapes had been cut out - see Subchapter 34.6 - Disengage &#13;
    Report. A review of the statements of the survivors from the 1st deck having &#13;
    been rather close to the area in question did not allow definite conclusions &#13;
    until it was possible to talk to one of them personally. This was Carl Övberg &#13;
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.2.151</a> and Subchapter 12.4.2 - who explained among other things that &#13;
    he saw water escaping under high pressure from the goose-necks fitted to two &#13;
    ventilation pipes coming up from 0-deck. He made this observation about 1 &#13;
    minute after the 3rd and most most heavy shock, vibration of the vessel but &#13;
    about 30 seconds before the big heel to starboard. This allows the conclusion &#13;
    that at least the 0-deck compartment directly below Carl Övberg must have &#13;
    been flooded and under pressure.This indicated a connection to the outside, &#13;
    i.e. a hole in the hull, in way of 0-deck as otherwise the compartment could &#13;
    not have been under pressure. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This scenario was &#13;
    among other things also presented at the first and second exhibition organised &#13;
    by this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997 when the &#13;
    complete investigation results were presented to the national and international &#13;
    public and media. Among the many pieces of information received during these &#13;
    exhibitions there were also explanations regarding possible explosions on &#13;
    board.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a relatively &#13;
    silent 1998 when most of the interested people were analysing and subsequently &#13;
    criticising the report of the JAIC a new person appeared in Sweden apparently &#13;
    with sufficient time, and an undisturbed mind, to analyse again all the publicly &#13;
    available video footage and documentation on this subject collected by the &#13;
    JAIC. He found among other things on the video B40b, made by the SPRINT ROV &#13;
    on 03.12.94, a package on the port superstructure in way of the 5th deck which &#13;
    appeared suspicious to him. Video images were made and shown among others &#13;
    also to experts in explosives in Sweden and Germany. See the following image.</font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1099.jpg" width="345" height="248"/></font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both identified the &#13;
    package with about 90% certainty to be an explosive charge used underwater.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Evaluation &#13;
    of the footage made by ROV on 02. and 09.10.94 revealed, however, that the &#13;
    package had not been at the identified location on the 5th deck on these dates, &#13;
    thus must have been placed there between the 09.10. and 03.12.94 and therefore &#13;
    could not be casualty related.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, &#13;
    the term "explosives", which had always been in the background during the &#13;
    preceding years of the investigation, was suddenly brought back to the attention &#13;
    of the investigators and the video footage available in Hamburg, all obtained &#13;
    from the JAIC, was analysed again also in an attempt to find possible explanations &#13;
    for numerous so far unexplained damage areas. It revealed among other things &#13;
    that an orange coloured cube had been attached to the recess of the port front &#13;
    bulkhead of the wreck in way of the hydraulic and manual side locks and the &#13;
    fastening of the bow ramp actuator. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cube was clearly &#13;
    visible and had been closely looked at by the ROV during the inspection on &#13;
    09.10.94, it could not, however, be found on the 02.10.94 videos which was &#13;
    possibly due to restricted visibility and was definitely not in this location &#13;
    on the SPRINT ROV made on 03.12.94 respectively on the diver video of the &#13;
    same date.<br/>&#13;
    Images were made from the orange coloured cube and identified by all three &#13;
    experts from Sweden, England and Germany with a high degree of probability &#13;
    as an<b> "explosive charge"</b>. See the following two images. </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="https://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1100.jpg" width="371" height="342"/></font></p>&#13;

  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As this charge attached &#13;
    in way of a very sensitive area - the port side locking devices of the visor &#13;
    and the fastening of the port bow ramp actuator - obviously did not explode, &#13;
    the corresponding area of the starboard side was analysed for possible explosion &#13;
    damage which was positively identified by the underwater explosive expert &#13;
    Brian Braidwood. This resulted in a further analysis of the available video &#13;
    footage all received from the JAIC. The results are outlined in the following &#13;
    subchapters. </font></p>&#13;

    all car/passenger ferries with bow doors were closely inspected as soon as &#13;
    possible whenever they arrived in a Swedish or Finnish ports. It is unknown &#13;
    whether this procedure was also carried out in the Estonian ports. From Sweden &#13;
    it is only known that reportedly 28 vessels were found to have serious defects &#13;
    to their bow-door arrangements. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From Finland &#13;

      are cruising in the Northern Baltic.<br/>&#13;
      A special Port State Control Survey has been carried out on board all the &#13;

      Maritime Inspector Tom Sommerdal surveyed about 10 vessels in Helsinki. &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the &#13;
    Swedish government instructed already on the<b> 03.10.94</b> the previous &#13;
    Supreme Court Judge <b>Magnus Sjöberg</b> to carry out an internal investigation &#13;
    of the National Maritime Administration for Shipping and Navigation - Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    - and, in particular, its Sjöfartsinspektionen - The Shipping Inspection (Shipinspec). &#13;
    This investigation covered among other things the subjects 1) to 3) stated &#13;
    on the previous page and was performed on basis of a Government decision defined &#13;
    as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 28 September &#13;
      1994, the passenger ferry Estonia foundered south-west of Utö in Finland &#13;
      en route from Tallinn to Stockholm. The vessel was flying the Estonian flag. &#13;
      On 29 September 1994, the Government commissioned the Board of Accident &#13;
      Investigation to assist in the accident inquiry. A joint accident board &#13;
      was then formed, with representatives from the Estonian, Finnish and Swedish &#13;
      authorities. One of the main functions of this board is to establish the &#13;
      reason for the accident.<br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Survivors &#13;
      of this maritime disaster have stated that the vessel's bow "visor" was &#13;
      torn away, which is supposed to have been an important cause of the sinking. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      Information has since emerged to the effect that incidents and problems &#13;
      with bow doors have occurred previously with ferries of the same type as &#13;
      the Estonia. A high standard of safety at sea demands that the necessary &#13;
      conclusions are regularly drawn from incidents and accidents that occur. &#13;
      In addition to the investigation now being carried out by the joint accident &#13;
      board (JAIC), other matters should be dealt with including the reporting &#13;
      routines within the Shipinspec. <br/>&#13;
      The Government commissions former Judge of the Supreme Court Magnus Sjöberg &#13;
      to carry out such a survey. As part of this, the investigator is to examine &#13;
      how information relevant to maritime safety is analysed and promulgated &#13;
      within the department, and where necessary put forward proposals for improvements. &#13;
      The investigator is also to look at the options for and the frequency of &#13;
      exchange of relevant maritime safety information between maritime safety &#13;
      authorities and other bodies that have important functions in the field &#13;
      of maritime safety, such as classification societies, insurers and shipowners' &#13;
      associations. Finally, the investigator should examine how such information &#13;
      exchange takes place between Shipinspec or corresponding bodies within our &#13;
      local region, and where necessary put forward proposals as to how this might &#13;
      be improved. <br/>&#13;
      The investigator shall carry out his work in contact with the JAIC and in &#13;

    It comprises 58 pages and deals exclusively with the conditions existing before &#13;
    and at the time of the ESTONIA accident and among other things the investigator &#13;
    has closely looked into the history of bow door failures and associated incidents &#13;
    as they were reflected in the various files of the different Sjöfartinspektionen &#13;
    offices - not at a central register - of which some shall be explained below:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a) The car/passenger &#13;
    ferry "VISBY"<br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger &#13;
    ferry VISBY was built in 1972 and had a gross tonnage of 6665 registered tons. &#13;
    On 12 November 1973 on its ordinary run between Nynäshamn and Visby, the forebody &#13;
    of the ship was struck by heavy seas. The result was that the bow door opened &#13;
    and water was shipped on the car deck. The master therefore decided to turn &#13;
    the vessel back to Nynäshamn. This event took place after the vessel had come &#13;
    out into the open sea. There was a high wind and heavy sea at the time. On &#13;
    survey of the damage it was found that both of the locking hooks of the bow &#13;
    door had been broken off and indentations were left on the door. As a temporary &#13;
    measure the bow door and cargo ramp were welded to the hull. After the repair &#13;
    had been water-tested and surveyed by the relevant Classification Society, &#13;
    Lloyds Register of Shipping, the vessel received temporary permission to continue &#13;
    trading until the next yard inspection. In February 1974 permanent repairs &#13;
    were carried out, in which the bow door received new locking hooks of heavier &#13;
    dimensions than previously, and the locking device was further reinforced &#13;
    by shroud screws with lashing attachments.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec's &#13;
    conclusion about the cause of the accident, as stated in the investigation &#13;
    report dated 1 November 1974, was that the bow door locking devices were of &#13;
    too weak construction. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) "STENA SAILER" &#13;
    <br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Ro-Ro &#13;
    cargo ship STENA SAILER was built in 1973 and had a gross registered tonnage &#13;
    of 2872. On a voyage between Zeebrügge and Dover on 16 January 1974 with a &#13;
    cargo of trailers and transport lorries, the vessel encountered heavy weather &#13;
    with increasing opposing seas. The vessel reduced its speed, but the strong &#13;
    sea broke apart the locking devices of the forward bow door, and lifted it &#13;
    out of closed position. The space between the bow door and the bow ramp was &#13;
    filled with water. The ramp was therefore secured using six chains. In order &#13;
    to avoid additional damage, the vessel was hove to and subsequently Rotterdam &#13;
    was called on as port of refuge where a temporary repairs were carried out. &#13;
    The locking mechanism and hoisting arms of the bow door had been damaged, &#13;
    and the port side ramp hydraulic actuators had become unusable after the failure &#13;
    of the operating rod attachment. The investigation report of Shipinspec dated &#13;
    12 December 1974 found that the cause of the accident was the took weak constructions &#13;
    of the locking devices of ramp and bow door.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(c) "SVEA STAR"</b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">SVEA STAR, &#13;
    a car/passenger ferry built in 1968 with a gross registered tonnage of 9963, &#13;
    was registered with Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Between Travemünde and Helsingborg &#13;
    on 5 May 1974, the vessel encountered heavy weather and rising seas. A particularly &#13;
    heavy sea struck the vessel, breaking the forward locking devices and extra &#13;
    securings and lifting up the bow door. Water collected between the forward &#13;
    door and the ramp. The vessel returned to Travemünde for damage inspection.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey &#13;
    it was found that all three hydraulic locking devices were completely damaged, &#13;
    and even the extra securing with two 2-inch turnbuckles had been torn apart. &#13;
    No damage was evident to the actual door or ramp. The locking devices were &#13;
    temporarily repaired and surveyed two days later in Helsingborg by both the &#13;
    Classification Society and the Department.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec &#13;
    investigation report dated 12 December 1974 states that in the opinion of &#13;
    the master, of the Classification Society and of the Department the accident &#13;
    was due to the too weak construction of the locking devices of the bow door. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(d) "SAGA STAR" &#13;
    </b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger &#13;
    ferry SAGA STAR, with a gross registered tonnage of 8226, was built in 1981. &#13;
    On 6 May 1982 the vessel was about to sail from Travemünde to Helsingborg. &#13;
    The weather was calm. When the bow visor was closed the port hinge failed &#13;
    which caused the port side of the visor to fall down four meters. The hydraulic &#13;
    hinges broke and oil leaked out. Immediately afterwards the starboard hinge &#13;
    failed too and the entire visor fell down . After having been surveyed by &#13;
    Lloyd's Register of Shipping, the vessel was given a permit to proceed to &#13;
    Helsingborg - via Malmö - without its bow visor.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey &#13;
    damage to the visor and its attachments to the hull, and hull damage between &#13;
    ramp and visor was ascertained. It was stated in the Shipinspec investigation &#13;
    report that the accident was probably due to the visor hinges having been &#13;
    of insufficient dimensions.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(e) "STENA JUTLANDICA" &#13;
    </b><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger &#13;
    ferry STENA JUTLANDICA was built in 1983, with a gross registered tonnage &#13;
    of 15 811. On 12 October 1984, STENA JUTLANDICA was berthed at Fredrikshamn. &#13;
    When the bow door was opened, the port hinge of the bow door failed and the &#13;
    bow door fell down a bout 2 metres. After having been lifted back into position, &#13;
    the door was welded in place. A permanent repair was carried out on a later &#13;
    occasion. When the bow door was inspected, cracks were found in the hinge &#13;
    attachment welds. The attachment plate was also partly cracked. According &#13;
    to the Shipinspec investigation report the cause for the hinge failure was &#13;
    the under-dimensioned welding seams of the hinge attachments which led to &#13;
    crack propagation. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(f) Certain other &#13;
    accidents to ro-ro vessels <br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The accident &#13;
    on 16 March 1987 involving the HARALD OF FREE ENTERPRISE led the Shipinspec &#13;
    immediately to carry out a review of all Swedish flag ferries from the stability &#13;
    point of view. Letters were also written to the owners with questions about &#13;
    such matters as their routines for operation and checking of bow and stern &#13;
    doors.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During this &#13;
    investigation details were also obtained of previous bow door damage to Finnish &#13;
    car/passenger ferries. For example, it was stated that the Finnish vessel &#13;
    FINLANDIA sustained damage to her bow door in 1981 which also led to a modification &#13;
    of her sister ship SILVIA REGINA, later STENA SAGA. It was also revealed that &#13;
    the Finnish car-passenger ferry MARIELLA suffered very severe visor damage &#13;
    in 1986 - see also further in this chapter - which led to structural changes &#13;
    of her and the visor of her sister ship OLYMPIA, then still under construction. &#13;
    During the investigation of the above events it turned out that the bows were &#13;
    designed with too much flare, which had resulted in extreme bow stresses. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a result of the &#13;
    disaster involving the ESTONIA, one of the actions taken in autumn 1994 was &#13;
    a specific inspection of passenger ferry bow visors by the Gothenburg Shipinspec &#13;
    office. Of the twelve ships examined within the Gothenburg area, eleven showed &#13;
    deficiencies. These ranged from the formation of cracks in the locking devices &#13;
    to operating system deficiencies. One vessel, the LION PRINCE, was not permitted &#13;
    to sail, while heavy weather restrictions were imposed on certain other vessels.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Finally, the following &#13;
    should be noted in this context. The mass media reported that the ESTONIA's &#13;
    sister ship, DIANA II, nearly lost her bow visor between Trelleborg and Rostock &#13;
    on the same stormy night in January 1993 when the Polish ferry JAN HEWELIUSZ &#13;
    sank. However, no so-called Section 70 report was submitted to the Department's &#13;
    Investigation Section as required by the existing regulations. Nor was this &#13;
    event, as far as it is known, brought to the attention of the central authority &#13;
    in any other way until after the loss of the ESTONA. The Department subsequently &#13;
    submitted the question of the master's conduct for possible prosecution, but &#13;
    the prosecutor decided not to bring an action. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The DIANA II as well &#13;
    as the also above-mentioned MARIELLA incident shall be explained in more detail &#13;
    later on in this chapter. Before, however, the reaction of the administration &#13;
    on the SAGA STAR accident shall be outlined as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After survey the &#13;
    chief inspector of the Malmö Shipinspec office, Åke Sjöblom, decided on 17 &#13;
    May 1982 that SAGA STAR could sail without the bow visor until the end of &#13;
    May, provided that the weather was good, that the voyages were undertaken &#13;
    at reduced speed, that due attention was paid to the other factors which might &#13;
    affect the seaworthiness of the vessel and that the log extracts were submitted &#13;
    to the Shipinspec after each voyage.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further &#13;
    decided that complete drawings, together with calculation material for "bow &#13;
    door", hinges and hydraulic arrangements should immediately be submitted to &#13;
    the Shipinspec. Following a survey on 17 May 1982 Lloyd's Register of Shipping &#13;
    awarded an Interim Classification Certificate in accordance with the Shipinspec's &#13;
    decision. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The new bow visor &#13;
    was surveyed and approved on 14 June 1982.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Classification &#13;
    Society submitted the requested calculation material, and the then Safety &#13;
    Section of Sjöfartsverket drew up its own highly comprehensive memorandum &#13;
    with computation sheets. This memoran-dum is dated 14 July 1982 and was intended &#13;
    to form the basis of discussions at a safety meeting. The memorandum proposed &#13;
    that the Administration should determine how various forces are to be calculated. &#13;
    There are also references to the accidents referred to above, and the fact &#13;
    that these led to changes in the rules of the Classification Societies. It &#13;
    was alleged also that the calculations submitted by the Societies indicated &#13;
    inadequate engineering input on the calculation and design side, and it was &#13;
    alleged that the Classification Societies did not monitor this aspect sufficiently. &#13;
    It was mentioned for example that the bow doors of the VISBY and a vessel &#13;
    named WASA STAR subsequently had to be strengthened. The author of the memorandum &#13;
    expressed a desire for further Classification Society and yard calculation &#13;
    material, and proposed that the Administration should take measures to prevent &#13;
    further accidents of the kind in question. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the &#13;
    file the matter was finalised by the then acting Sea Safety Direction of Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    who wrote to Lloyd's Register of Shipping on 21 September 1982, criticising &#13;
    the Society's calculations and superinten-dence. The letter concludes as follows: &#13;
    "The Administration requests that you test the suggestions made regarding &#13;
    the present version and indicate the reinforcements that you consider necessary. &#13;
    In view of the fact that the locking devices of bow visors broke open in bad &#13;
    weather on a number of vessels, the Administration further requests you to &#13;
    account for the dimensioning of the locking devices of this vessel." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently the SAGA &#13;
    STAR accident had triggered off even more activities within the Administration &#13;
    as reflected in the letter that the then Safety Director, Per Eriksson, wrote &#13;
    on 15.03.84 to Lorenzo Spinelli of the Italian Classification Society RINA &#13;
    - see Enclosure 33.419. It reveals that the strength expert, Gunnar Hjertstedt, &#13;
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) had written a memo &#13;
    after the cause investigation following the SAGA STAR accident and after the &#13;
    subsequent discussions with Lloyd's Register, of which page 1 is available &#13;
    and where among other things it is stated:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The correspondence &#13;
      and discussions with the classification society involved in this problem &#13;
      have shown that they consider the opening and closing arrangement of doors &#13;
      as lifting appliances exempted from their surveys, except on special request &#13;
      of the owner, while the other scantlings of the door and the locking arrangement &#13;
      are subject to their control. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To &#13;
      this procedure the Swedish Administration of Shipping and Navigation (Note: &#13;
      Sjöfartsverket) has the following objection. Details involved in the opening &#13;
      and closing of bows are integrated parts of the doors, which we find difficult &#13;
      to separate from the regulations concerning securing and the problem to &#13;
      calculate and establish the scantlings of other details of the door. If &#13;
      the control in this case is separated to different authorities the hazard &#13;
      of missing important control objects is great, which has been demonstrated &#13;
      in this case. The Administration of Shipping and Navigation would suggest &#13;
      that this problem is discussed within IACS.«</font></i></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The memo had apparently &#13;
    been written sometime in 1982, but in March 1984 the responsible safety director &#13;
    was obviously not even certain whether he had passed it on to "dear Lorenzo" &#13;
    when being reminded by his strength expert before his retirement, which is &#13;
    another demonstration of the attitude of the responsible authorities in those &#13;
    years. The only page available of this memo is attached together with another &#13;
    page from another letter or memo signed by Gunnar Hjertstedt but without date &#13;
    referring to the "closing and securing of doors" as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.420.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    33.420.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After each of the &#13;
    above-mentioned accidents exclusively concerning bow doors of car/passenger &#13;
    ferries or Ro-Ro cargo vessels which were only 1 year or less old - with the &#13;
    exception of the SVEA STAR having been 8 years old - Shipinspec and/or Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    only investigated against the Classification Societies, mainly Lloyd's Register &#13;
    but also Bureau Veritas and Norske Veritas. The Building Yards are not even &#13;
    mentioned and the Classification Societies were blamed for took weak construction &#13;
    and/or under-dimensioned locking devices and hinges. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is, of course, &#13;
    remarkable to note bearing in mind that the head of the Investigation Section &#13;
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfarts-verket) attended all the &#13;
    meetings of the JAIC investigating the ESTONIA casualty, be it the official &#13;
    full Commission meetings or the internal meetings of the Swedish part of the &#13;
    JAIC where it had obviously been decided already shortly after the catastrophe &#13;
    to put most of the blame on the Building Yard. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally the report &#13;
    of the Gothenburg office of the Shipinspec concerning the STENA SAILER accident &#13;
    shall be quoted as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 2 May 1974, &#13;
      a report was received from the Gothenburg Shipinspec office of a meeting &#13;
      dealing with examination of bow door locking devices. From this report it &#13;
      emerged that STENA SAILER's bow door had come open during a previous voyage. &#13;
      It also appeared that the bow door of STENA SAILER's sister ship, the UNION &#13;
      WELLINGTON under the New Zealand flag, despite having been reinforced, had &#13;
      been opened during heavy weather. Another sister ship, the SEA TRADER, had &#13;
      crossed the Atlantic in bad weather, but on this vessel the bow door had &#13;
      been welded closed. The following may also be found in the report. "During &#13;
      the meeting, it emerged that very little is known about the forces that &#13;
      affect the bow door. However, through the trials conducted by G.L. (Note: &#13;
      by Germanischer Lloyd), some slight under-standing of this has been gained. &#13;
      It appeared that more or less all the locking devices on existing vessels &#13;
      with bow doors are of too weak construction. That matters have gone as well &#13;
      as they have so far is due to the fact that vessels with bow doors are mostly &#13;
      used in restricted trades where they do not normally meet such heavy weather. &#13;
      I propose that the Administration investigates how locking devices on bow &#13;
      doors ought to be placed, designed and constructed, and that there should &#13;
      then be a check on the locking devices of existing vessels. This presumably &#13;
      will not be done by the Classification Societies, since after all these &#13;
      have already approved the existing locking devices."«</i></font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Special &#13;
    attention has to be drawn to the obvious fact that this proposal was made &#13;
    already in May 1974 by the chief inspector of the Gothenburg office to the &#13;
    National Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report of Magnus &#13;

      submitted to Lloyd's Register of Shipping in connection with VISBY and SVEA &#13;
      STAR. Bureau Veritas was given the chance to respond to the questions in &#13;
      the memorandum and to give its views on the accident in question. It was &#13;

    broke, the visor was lifted up and remained connected to the ship only by &#13;
    the visor actuators. Due to the enormous pressure, exerted on the pistons &#13;
    during thrusting up the visor, the pistons were widened and the pressure lessened. &#13;
    As a result thereof the visor came down again and the ingress of a large quantity &#13;
    of water onto the car deck was only prevented by the immediately initiated &#13;
    full-astern manoeuvre. The ship continued to Stockholm on very slow speed. &#13;
    The Classification Society of MARIELLA was and is Det norske Veritas. At the &#13;
    time of this incident the vessel was still under guarantee. It was considered &#13;
    to exchange the heavily damaged visor with the identical visor of her sister &#13;
    ship OLYMPIA which was still under construction at the Turku Shipyard, but &#13;
    it was subsequently decided to repair and convert the visor on site while &#13;
    the ferry kept trading and during which time the loading/discharging operations &#13;
    were carried out exclusively via the stern ramps. The repairs, which also &#13;
    included the locking devices being considerably reinforced, required about &#13;
    5 months.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This incident, &#13;
    which was probably the most serious visor damage of a car/passenger ferry &#13;
    in the Baltic area before the ESTONIA catastrophe, led to considerable discussions &#13;
    in the shipping industry. The fact that DnV participated in the inspections/meetings &#13;
    with three Finnish representa-tives and one Swedish representative underlines &#13;
    that the problems were realized and that it was clearly considered to be a &#13;
    Class matter, the F.B.N. was not involved. After analysing the events it was &#13;
    agreed that the immediate reduction of the speed and the turning of the stern &#13;
    into the sea had finally prevented the loss of the visor and the subsequent &#13;
    probably unavoidable catastrophe. - See the Inspection Report <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.422.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    33.422. </a><br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The MARIELLA &#13;
    - same as the ESTONIA - is equipped with a visor/bow ramp combination, i.e. &#13;
    the upper part of the ramp extends into a deck house which is part of the &#13;
    visor. In addition to this the vessel is equipped with a 2.50 m high and moveable &#13;
    collision bulkhead on the car deck.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence &#13;
    of the MARIELLA accident the locking devices for the bow visor of her sister &#13;
    ship OLYMPIA, delivered in April 1986, were totally changed upon the instructions &#13;
    of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - inspector Lennart Ahlberg. The owner, Gustav &#13;
    Myrsten, was reportedly personally handling the changes and reinforcements &#13;
    of the locking devices. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently &#13;
    the OLYMPIA was chartered by P&amp;O and used in liner service between Southampton &#13;
    and Bilbao. At the same time the Classification Society was changed from DnV &#13;
    to Bureau Veritas (B.V.) and P&amp;O ordered the installation of eight additional &#13;
    locking devices in view of the regular crossing of the Bay of Biscay.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>SAINT PATRICK &#13;
    II <br/></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Built for &#13;
    SF-Line, the third Viking Line partner, in 1973 as TURELLA by Sietas Werft, &#13;
    Hamburg. She is a passenger/Ro-Ro cargo/ferry of 7984 gross tons and 1325 &#13;
    dwt, built to Lloyd's Register Class Rules and supervision and is classed &#13;
    + 100 A1, Ice Class I, Ice Class IA, which corresponds to Finnish/Swedish &#13;
    Ice Class Rules 1971. The vessel is fitted with a bow visor and ramp for vehicle &#13;
    access at the forward end. At the aft end there is a stern door/ramp. The &#13;
    mean draught is 5.35 m, while ESTONIA's draught was about 5.5 m. Information &#13;
    was received from Helsinki about damage to the visor of this ferry having &#13;
    been in bare-boat charter for Tallink (ESCO) from September 1993 to May 1994 &#13;
    between Helsinki and Tallinn. During this time the ferry experienced the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 11 January &#13;
      1994 </b>- The bow visor was frozen in position above and below the Atlantic &#13;
      lock, which was the modification fitted in 1982 consisting of a hydraulic &#13;
      locking arrangement between the forepeak tank top below the bow ramp position &#13;
      and the bottom of the visor. The visor could not be opened in Tallinn and &#13;
      the vessel was discharged by the stern. The visor's lower area was heated &#13;
      with steam hoses to clear the ice and then released. </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- on 18 February &#13;
      1994</b> - The starboard side bow plating, below the visor and in way of &#13;
      the Atlantic lock space, was found to be heavily set in and the visor could &#13;
      not be opened. After discharge of vehicles, on the early morning, the vessel &#13;
      went to the Baltic Shipyard, where repairs were effected to the starboard &#13;
      bow. See the attached photo documentation. After this incident on 18 February, &#13;
      extreme care was taken when navigating in ice conditions, with the vessel &#13;
      being trimmed by the stern to keep the visor higher above the waterline.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 29 March &#13;
      1994</b> - The bow visor was found to be jammed and upon examination it &#13;
      was noted that the port side bow shell plating, in way of the Atlantic lock &#13;
      position, had been heavily set in, similar in nature to the damage noted &#13;
      on the starboard side on 18 February 1994. Immediate temporary repairs were &#13;
      carried out to allow the vessel to continue her service. On 4 April 1994 &#13;
      it became necessary to carry out some additional welding to the temporary &#13;
      repair on the port side. Upon subsequent dry-docking it was found that extensive &#13;
      damage to the shell plating on both sides had been sustained whilst the &#13;
      bow visor was damaged as follows:</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Bow lower edge &#13;
      plating, port and starboard buckled and set in and visor void tank possibly &#13;

    Structural Analysis of Bow Visor and Locking Devices<br/>&#13;
    by means of the Finite Element Analysis by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As part of the investigation &#13;
    in connection with the sinking of the ferry ESTONIA the structure of the visor &#13;
    has been calculated on the basis of the load requirements by the Classification &#13;
    Society Bureau Veritas (B.V.) by means of the Finite Element Method. Thereby &#13;
    the distribution of the reaction forces on the fixing points of the visor, &#13;
    and especially on the Atlantic lock, were of particular interest because of &#13;
    the allegations published by the JAIC that the casualty had been initiated &#13;
    by the failure of the locking devices of the visor. For this reason detailed &#13;
    calculations have been performed, including cases whereby only a limited attachment &#13;
    still existed after the hinges had failed. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time &#13;
    of the design and construction of the vessel in 1979/1980 such detailed calculations &#13;
    were neither required by the Classification Societies nor were they state-of-the-art. &#13;
    The selected load on the model is based on an analysis of B.V. whereby the &#13;
    load, acting normally on the shell plating of the visor was assumed to be &#13;
    the water pressure acting on the visor when the ferry was underway. The load &#13;
    acting on the lowest part of the visor was assumed to be 7 t/m² and decreasing &#13;
    continuously with increasing height. At no height level is the pressure less &#13;
    than 3.5 t/m². The load includes the C-deck (forecastle deck). <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The weight &#13;
    of the empty visor and the rubber packings on the forepeak deck have been &#13;
    taken into account in all calculations. Wave loads have been assumed to act &#13;
    only on the port side of the visor.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Before discussing &#13;
    the results, the symbols for the directions into which the forces were acting &#13;
    shall be explained:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> x = transverse &#13;
      (athwartship)<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">y = longitudinal &#13;
      (forward aft)<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">z = vertical &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The calculations &#13;
    clearly reveal that as long as the hinges are intact the Atlantic lock takes &#13;
    only very little load. The force direction is opposite to the direction into &#13;
    which the vessel is proceeding, i.e. aft. The small load is to be attributed &#13;
    to the low stiffeners and the high deformation of the visor bottom. Even by &#13;
    using a more detailed net of finite elements no other tendencies became apparent &#13;
    respectively no other results were achieved. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In normal cases &#13;
    the highest loads appear in way of the side locks. The loads cause the aft &#13;
    bulkheads of the visor to be pressed against the front bulkheads of the vessel &#13;
    in the middle and upper areas.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case also &#13;
    the rubber packing of the visor on the vessel's front bulkheads are taken &#13;
    into account the vertically acting loads are reduced.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If a load is &#13;
    acting on the visor only from one side the hinge on this side has to bear &#13;
    excessive load while the load on the other is less than normal, however, partly &#13;
    acting from different directions.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the &#13;
    visor is under constant pressure the loads on the hinges and side locks do &#13;
    increase while the load on the Atlantic lock is decreasing. In case one or &#13;
    both hinges fail all other fixing points have to bear substantially more load &#13;
    and the force direction on the Atlantic lock changes to the opposite direction, &#13;
    i.e. to forward. <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case one &#13;
    hinge fails the Atlantic lock has to bear 2.6 times of the normal load, if &#13;
    both hinges fail the Atlantic lock has to bear 15.8 times of the normal load. &#13;
    <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results &#13;
    of this structural analysis of the visor can be summarised as follows: </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By means of several &#13;
    calculation models various load conditions have been simulated, for example &#13;
    the pressure load according to B.V., the load from the side and the load due &#13;
    to a permanent pressure load. In all cases the visor's own weight was taken &#13;
    into account.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The different &#13;
    fixing point conditions were simulated as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - visor fixed &#13;
      to hinges and locking devices,<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally &#13;
      the rubber packings were considered,<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally &#13;
      considering the manual side locks, <br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- failure &#13;
      of one and both hinges. The analysis reveals that the Atlantic lock absorbs &#13;
      only a small force component as long as the hinges are intact. The force &#13;
      direction is aft.</font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The highest forces &#13;
    on the fixing points are effective when the load is acting simultaneously &#13;
    on both side locks. If the visor is exposed to a load only on one side, the &#13;
    load on the hinges on this side is the biggest.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case that &#13;
    one or both hinges fail, the Atlantic lock becomes exposed to very heavy loads &#13;
    and the force direction changes by 180° to forward.<br/></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If both hinges &#13;
    fail the Atlantic lock has to take the heaviest load. The complete Report &#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In Estonia such an organisation &#13;
    did not exist, but already early in the morning of the casualty day President &#13;
    Lennart Meri had decided that in Estonia an independent commission should &#13;
    be formed "to investigate the circumstances having led to the casualty and &#13;
    the government organisations". (The Andi Meister book: "The Unfinished Logbook".) &#13;
    This commission should consist of 11 members, mainly ministers and their representatives. &#13;
    Chairman to be was the Minister for Transport and Communication, Andi Meister, &#13;
    an engineer by profession. Captain Uno Laur, up to 1992 head of the navigation &#13;
    department of ESCO and now a maritime consultant, was appointed by the President &#13;
    to be his personal representative. <br/>&#13;
          When Prime Minister Maart Laar returned to &#13;
    Tallinn that same evening and reported about the decision to form a joint &#13;
    commission, five names from the above-mentioned 11 member commission were &#13;
    selected and the embassies of Sweden and Finland were informed accordingly. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
          Also the same evening the Swedish JAIC members &#13;
    together with the Swedish observer, Captain Sten Andersson from Sjöfartsverket, &#13;
    flew over to Turku and met the Finnish members who had been on site since &#13;
    the morning already and the first discussions between these two groups took &#13;
    place.<br/>&#13;
         On the following morning, 29 September, the Swedish &#13;
    and Finnish JAIC members met again and, after some further discussions, decided &#13;
    to invite the Estonians to come over the for first joint meeting straight &#13;
    away, which they did. By means of the Estonian Coast Guard plane the following &#13;
    persons flew to Turku: </font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">At 14.00 hours the first &#13;
    meeting of the three-nations JAIC in Turku commenced which was attended by &#13;
    the persons listed up in Enclosure 35.1.440. Among others things it was decided, &#13;
    that Estonia should have the lead of the JAIC because the vessel had been &#13;
    flying the Estonian flag. <br/>&#13;
          Subsequently the three crew members considered &#13;
    to be key witnesses were heard by the joint JAIC. See Subchapter 37.1.<br/>&#13;
          At the first meeting of the JAIC, also the &#13;
    head of the Navigation Department of ESCO and Safety Adviser of Estline, Captain &#13;
    Enn Neidre, was present, which apparently was considered to be normal procedure, &#13;
    viz. that the manager responsible for officers and crew inside the organisation &#13;
    of a shipping company is on-site when the survivors come ashore in order to &#13;
    talk to them and prepare them to give evidence to the police subsequently, &#13;
    that is to say, <i>"to remind them of their loyalty to their company"</i>. &#13;
    That was actually done by Enn Neidre but he also attended the subsequent hearings &#13;
    of the key witnesses Silver Linde, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak by the police &#13;
    and the meanwhile formed JAIC. <br/>&#13;
          The so-called key witnesses and other uninjured &#13;
    crew members who returned to Tallinn on the evening of 29 September 1994 had &#13;
    already been interrogated in Turku. Some of them, considered to be able to &#13;
    give important evidence, up to three times, i.e. by the Finnish, Swedish and &#13;
    Estonian police respectively security police. Upon arrival at the Tallinn &#13;
    airport in the evening they were again interrogated by the Estonian criminal &#13;
    and security police. <br/>&#13;
          Apparently it became obvious to the Estonians &#13;
    in the course of the following days what really had gone wrong with the ESTONIA &#13;
    and what it would mean for the reputation of the young state of Estonia if &#13;
    the evidence given by some surviving crew members about the real causes for &#13;
    the catastrophe would get to the public. It was thus decided to have somebody &#13;
    with authority inside the JAIC, who was respected and feared by the crew and &#13;
    who would - just by his presence - remind them of their "loyalty obligation" &#13;
    to ESCO. This was Captain Enn Neidre, the head of the Navigation Department &#13;
    of ESCO and safety adviser for Estline.<br/>&#13;
          Although in an <i>"Immediate Press Release"</i> &#13;
    by the Foreign Ministry of Estonia on 10.10.94 at 17.00 hours - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/35.1.441.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    35.1.441</a> - Indrek Tarand is still mentioned as JAIC member, only half &#13;
    an hour later in a further "Immediate Release" by the same Ministry - see &#13;
    Enclosure 35.1.442 - his name was exchanged by that of Enn Neidre.<br/>&#13;
    Consequently the Estonian part of the JAIC consisted of </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> So much for the newly formed/appointed &#13;
    JAIC for the time being. The conflict of interests was programmed from the &#13;
    very beginning and the members from Sweden and Finland were very much aware &#13;
    of it. <i>"Estonia will bear the main responsibility for the investigation"</i>, &#13;
    said Carl Bildt at the press conference in Turku following the decision of &#13;
    the three Prime Ministers to form the JAIC, <i>"however in practice it will &#13;

    meetings in his capacity as head of the Division of Maritime Inspection of &#13;
    the Finnish Board of Navigation. Consequently all three National Maritime &#13;
    Administrations, having been responsible for the proper certification and &#13;
    compliance of the ferry with SOLAS and other safety conventions were represented &#13;
    at all the meetings of the JAIC, where among other things the failures and &#13;
    omissions of their organisations were - or, at least, should have been - investigated &#13;
    and they even participated in the final drafting of the Report of the JAIC &#13;

    in the JAIC by Detective Chief Superintendent Hari Rahikka and for the Swedish &#13;

    The Documentation </font></b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The Swedish and Finnish parts &#13;
    of the JAIC were obliged by law to keep a register - logbook (<i>dagbok</i>), &#13;
    into which the complete incoming and outgoing documentation had to be registered &#13;
    day-by-day. <br/>&#13;
          It is unknown what Estonian law requires in &#13;
    this respect and how it was complied with by the Estonian part of the JAIC. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
          In Sweden a very detailed and accurate looking &#13;
    logbook system was kept from the very beginning, although it does not contain &#13;
    the complete documentation. In Finland apparently no system whatsoever does &#13;
    exist. <br/>&#13;
          The Swedish documentation is contained in 9 &#13;
    files A - J, as far as it is known, in which the documents were registered &#13;
    with running numbers, in total more than 1000. The complete register is available &#13;
    to this 'Group of Experts', but not attached to this report. While working &#13;
    papers and other documents considered to be crucial for the investigation &#13;
    were kept <i>"classified"</i> until the Final Report was published, most of &#13;
    the documentation collected by the Swedish part of the JAIC as time went by &#13;
    was open to the public although this was realised by very few people only. &#13;
    After the publication of the Final Report everything should have been made &#13;
    public according to applicable regulations. They were however not complied &#13;
    with as certain documents known to have been in the possession of a member &#13;
    of the JAIC cannot be traced in the files nor are they registered. This refers &#13;
    especially to the repair lists from on board of ESTONIA in which the crew &#13;
    was - among other things - asking for repair of the broken port outer hinge &#13;
    of the bow ramp. According to Börje Stenström these lists have been in his &#13;
    possession. </font></p>&#13;

    Governments of the three countries involved, their various administrations &#13;
    and other organisations took place during the early days and following weeks &#13;

  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On the day after the casualty, &#13;
    29 September 1994, Chief Inspector Åke Sjöblom and Inspector Gunnar Zahlée &#13;
    returned from Tallinn to Sweden with their knowledge of the extremely bad &#13;
    condition of visor and bow ramp, the incompetence of the crew and finally &#13;
    the impossibility to stop the ferry from departing despite all their endeavours. &#13;
    See Chapter 15. <br/>&#13;
          Already on the following day a confidential &#13;
    meeting behind closed doors took place which was chaired by the then head &#13;
    of Sjöfartsinspektionen, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, with the heads of the Stockholm &#13;
    and Gothenburg offices of Sjöfartsinspektionen and their assistants attending. &#13;
    Åke Sjöblom informed those assembled about his real findings and his desperate &#13;
    but futile attempts to stop the ferry from departing. The very far reaching &#13;
    consequences were discussed, but then it was decided to inform the public &#13;
    that only minor deficiencies had been found, moreover that the inspection &#13;
    had only been on-the-job training and not a real PSC. See <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;
    15</a>. This official version is upheld by Sjöfartsverket up to day and Åke &#13;
    Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée have confirmed it when being questioned by police &#13;
    and the public prosecutor. <br/>&#13;
           It is unknown whether the members of &#13;
    the Swedish part of the JAIC were informed during a meeting in the Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    head office in Norrköping on 13 October 1994. It has to be assumed that Olof &#13;
    Forssberg and Börje Stenström were informed, because otherwise it would not &#13;
    be understandable that Börje Stenström in his capacity as chief maritime technical &#13;
    investigator did not take part in the questioning of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar &#13;
    Zahlée at the office of the Swedish JAIC in November 1994, which was, at least &#13;
    officially, the only time that these two - being really key witnesses as to &#13;
    the ferry's condition before her last departure - have been interrogated by &#13;
    JAIC members. <br/>&#13;
           Åke Sjöblom at the beginning wrote a &#13;
    draft version of his report con-cerning the "On-the-job training on the Estonia" &#13;
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.198.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    15.198</a> - and did send this draft by letter of 24 October 1994 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.199.htm" target="_blank">see &#13;
    Enclosure 15.199</a> - to Willand Ringborg being in charge of the Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    project of the training of Estonian safety inspectors. Recently another copy &#13;

      her from sailing on 27.09.94. </i>      (Handwriting &#13;
      of Åke Sjöblom.)<br/>&#13;
      The 2nd note at the bottom in another handwriting reads: <br/>&#13;
            <i>If she would have been stopped on the &#13;
      27th to correct all the 17, they would probably quite quickly have      found &#13;

      been detained for a few weeks in      Estonia. &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Attached was a copy of the &#13;
    filled-in PSC form of the Swedish National Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) &#13;

    Zahlée and their Estonian trainees. On this copy, which is signed by the "Head &#13;
    of National Ship Inspec. <b>Division</b>" Aarne Valgma, also the 3rd column &#13;
    referring to <i>"references to conventions" </i>is filled in, which is only &#13;
    required in case the vessel was detained which had, at least, been the intention &#13;
    as confirmed by the above quoted notes. Although this copy - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    15.200</a> - is recorded in the register of the Swedish part of the JAIC under &#13;
    A46b, it has not been attached to the Final Report of the JAIC as supplement, &#13;
    nor is anything of the above mentioned in this report. Instead the Estonian &#13;
    version of this "filled-in PSC form" is attached as Supplement 223 together &#13;
    with an explanation by the E.N.M.B. dated 31.05.96 which was translated by &#13;
    Uno Laur into English and reads as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"It is hereby reported &#13;
      that a Port State (PSC) training inspection was carried out by the inspectors &#13;
      of the Estonian National Maritime Board's Ship Inspection Department (with &#13;
      assistance of the Swedish Maritime Administration inspectors) on m.v. 'Estonia' &#13;
      on 27.09.94. The purpose of this inspection was to obtain experience for &#13;
      the Estonian inspectors in respect of large passenger ships and also to &#13;
      carry out a Port State Control (PSC) of this vessel. As a result of this &#13;
      inspection all shortcomings noted by the inspectors and instructors were &#13;
      fixed in the "Report of Inspection in Accordance with the Memorandum of &#13;
      Understanding on Port State Control". This Report was signed by the Head &#13;
      of National Ship Inspection Department A.Valgma. Later on this Report was &#13;
      used as a teaching aid on training of inspectors. The aim of this inspection &#13;
      was not to find out the knowledge and training of the officers or crew members &#13;
      because it is the task of other authorities. In course of discussings with &#13;
      the ship's officers the theoretical problems of stability were not touched &#13;
      since the inspectors were interested in technical condition and organizational &#13;
      level of the vessel. <br/>&#13;

            This Estonian version does not contain the &#13;
      entries in column 3 and the explanation for this column at the bottom is &#13;
      illegible. Also the references to the Swedish Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) &#13;
      have been deleted respectively were made illegible. The copy is also signed &#13;
      by Aarne Valgma, however as "Head of National Ship Inspect. <b>Department</b>". &#13;
      For more details see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15.</a> &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
            The described manipulation of the documentation &#13;
      was a vain attempt to disguise the personal tragedy of the two Swedes who &#13;
      had on this occasion completely failed in their professional mission. <br/>&#13;
            The members of the E.N.M.B. in the trainee &#13;
      team - in particular Aarne Valgma - had the authority to detain the vessel &#13;
      until repairs had been effected (see Chapter 15), whether this inspection &#13;
      qualified as a Port State Control inspection or not <a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank">(see &#13;
      Chapters 9.3.</a>, 15). <br/>&#13;
            The two Swedes had no such authority and &#13;
      those who had in Sweden and were contacted by Sjöblom (see Chapter 15) did &#13;
      not live up to their professional duties. The reason may be the notorious &#13;
      lack of fantasy in bureaucrats. All they would have to do is to communicate &#13;
      to the Estonian authorities that the vessel would not be permitted to enter &#13;
      Swedish waters or ports in this condition. In the JAIC Report, Chapter 5.2, &#13;
      only the following is mentioned: </font></p>&#13;

    <ul><li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Estonian Estline &#13;
        Director, Johannes Johanson, told Reuters on the day of the casualty that<b><i> &#13;

        the Baltic Sea.</i></b> Thereafter security measures had been intensified. &#13;

        head of the Navigation Department of ESCO and safety adviser of Estline &#13;
        he must have known about this threat. It can therefore be assumed that &#13;
        he informed the other Estonian JAIC members about these threats. Whether &#13;
        Andi Meister being - in his capacity as Transport Minister - the highest &#13;
        representative of his country for sea safety was not already aware is &#13;
        unknown to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></li>&#13;

        the Traffic Director of Estline, Yrjo Saariinen, who definitely knew about &#13;
        the bomb threats and presumably reported them to the intermediate Estonian &#13;
        Commission. Both left this commission upon their own recommendation shortly &#13;
        after its foundation. </font></li>&#13;

        in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i> on page 21 among other things &#13;
        after the wreck had been found: <i>"On the recordings of the search vessel &#13;
        the front side of the vessel was flat and then for the first time the &#13;
        idea came up that the waves had torn off the visor and that water had &#13;
        penetrated the car deck via the bow ramp which was also confirmed by survivors. &#13;
        Another possibility seemed not to exist. <b>On the other hand, a bomb &#13;
        could also not be fully excluded." </b></i></font></li>&#13;

        of the training vessel "LINDA", having been berthed in Tallinn on the &#13;
        evening of 27 September 1994, told SPIEGEL TV in December 1999 that he &#13;
        had overheard a VHF conversation between the ESTONIA and "Port Control", &#13;
        i.e. the Harbour Master's office. "Port Control" had asked the ESTONIA &#13;
        either shortly before or after the departure whether the search for bombs &#13;
        had brought any result. ESTONIA's answer was: No. </font></li>&#13;

        a ferry carrying on each voyage 1000 people or more onboard is with certainty &#13;
        a matter to be reported to the Board of Directors. It has to be assumed &#13;
        therefore that Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Director of N&amp;T - see &#13;
        Subchapter 5.2 - and member of the Board of Estline was informed. It is &#13;
        most likely that he - in turn - informed the N&amp;T management because at &#13;
        about the same time there were bomb threats against Silja vessels, which &#13;
        were considered to be so serious that drastic safety measures were introduced &#13;
        at the Silja pier in Stockholm. </font></li>&#13;
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It was confirmed by &#13;
        Sjöfartsinspect's inspector Lennart Ahlberg to SPIEGEL TV in December &#13;
        1999 that the Estonian as well as the Swedish criminal police and also &#13;
        Sjöfartsverket were informed about these bomb threats.</font></li>&#13;
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In summary of the aforementioned &#13;
        it has to be concluded that relevant governmental agencies of Estonia &#13;
        and Sweden, and probably also Finland, especially their police organisations &#13;
        were aware that there had been recent threats to sink ESTONIA by bomb &#13;
        explosions and that the last threat dated 27 September, when the ferry &#13;
        had been searched but apparently without result. It has to be assumed &#13;
        that the JAIC members had the same knowledge as Olof Forssberg was a high &#13;
        ranking civil servant with the Ministry of Defence and Kari Lethola being &#13;
        part of the Ministry of Justice.</font></li>&#13;
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It is unknown to this &#13;
        'Group of Experts' whether the government agencies mentioned before also &#13;
        knew already on the morning of 28 September that there possibly had been &#13;
        explosions onboard of the ESTONIA because the technical facilities available &#13;
        to the Nordic countries and their partners to detect explosions at sea &#13;
        are not the subject of this investigation.</font></li>&#13;
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> But the way in which &#13;
        the JAIC members and the Finnish criminal police officers performed the &#13;
        interrogations of the survivors does indicate that they had knowledge &#13;
        of - at least - possible explosions onboard. The questioning of the German &#13;
        survivor Manfred Rothe by the criminal police in Helsinki may serve as &#13;
        an example. It was video-filmed and according to the transcript he was &#13;
        asked among other things: <br/>&#13;
            <i>"1. Mr. Rothe, could one think that the vessel was &#13;
        hit by a mine?</i><br/>&#13;
              <i>2. ... and, no explosives at all?" </i>(See &#13;

      which had been below water for 7 weeks. According to the explosives expert &#13;
      Martin Volk this is only possible by a metallurgical examination of the &#13;

      The "Hole in the Starboard Side"</b></font> </p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 2/3 and 9/10 October &#13;
      1994 ROV inspections of the wreck were carried out in the presence of Tuomo &#13;
      Karppinen of the Finnish JAIC. The hole in the forward part of the starboard &#13;
      hull seems to have been discovered which assumption is confirmed by the &#13;
      many cuts of the video footage of this area. The existence of this hole &#13;
      seems to have been known also to Sten Andersson, thus at a certain level &#13;
      within Sjöfartsverket, as well as to the JAIC members. This fact was consequently &#13;
      leaked out to the press, as is first shown in the article on 18 October &#13;
      1994 in DAGENS NYHETER by Anders Hellberg, where he states: </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">"Bow Visor Tore Up Holes &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        Accident Commission convinced what caused the Estonia casualty. Estonia's &#13;
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together &#13;
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull caused water &#13;
        to flow on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the &#13;
        ship completely changed. <br/>&#13;
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces &#13;
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, &#13;
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the JAIC who was not present at the Monday &#13;
        session in Tallinn.<br/>&#13;
        Also from other very well informed sources <b>DN has received the same &#13;
        information, that holes in the hull contributed to water getting into &#13;
        the ship so quickly</b>. According to Sten Andersson, the three visor &#13;
        locks, two on the sides and one at the bottom, were ripped off. This can &#13;
        be seen from the new underwater pictures taken. <br/>&#13;
        The DN's source, with substantial knowledge of the ship's construc-tion, &#13;
        has difficulties believing that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic &#13;
        lock - could have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. The source &#13;
        said: "I rather believe that the visor attachments on the deck have broken &#13;
        and that the 54.5 ton visor fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock. &#13;
        The bow visor then started to move forward/ aft tearing on the upper part &#13;
        of the ramp on which cars and trailers normally drive. The bow ramp hung &#13;
        on the visor and was finally dragged out a meter or two in its upper part. &#13;
        Here water came into car deck."<br/><b>Note: </b>This should be the other way round: The visor actually hung &#13;
        on the bow ramp, but it may be a misunderstanding. <br/>&#13;
        But many experts have had difficulties to believe that this compara-tively &#13;
        small opening of the ramp would have let in such huge amounts of water, &#13;
        that later sank the ship. More than 1000 tonnes have entered.<br/>&#13;
        The two pieces of information explain how additional water came into the &#13;
        ship. When the visor finally broke loose the hydraulic actuators, that &#13;
        normally regulate the opening, tore big holes into the hull. The beam &#13;
        on which the actuator was fastened has, in its turn, <b>ripped off part &#13;
        of the hull plating. There are pictures of those damages, that we just &#13;
        got from the new videos taken by the underwater cameras, Sten Andersson &#13;
        says. </b><br/><b>Note:</b> Such pictures are not visible on the video footage publicly &#13;
        available.<br/>&#13;
        According to the source of DN this scenario gives "violent mechanical &#13;
        damages and big holes in the hull". Those holes will then be situated &#13;
        under the water line in the heavy sea. <br/>&#13;
        Survivors have testified about several different bangs, that might explain &#13;
        how the bow visor first came loose in its lockings from the actuator attachments. &#13;
        <br/>&#13;
        Those who stayed in the cabins under car deck in the foremost part of &#13;
        the ship have told about a scraping from the outside of the bottom, that &#13;
        is the outside of the ship. That sound might have been caused by the finally &#13;
        ripped-off visor drifting along the ship's side. The new conclusions of &#13;
        the JAIC changes the earlier picture, where the visor was ripped off and &#13;
        the bow port was instead pushed in by the violent sea. <br/>&#13;
        The question then is of course whether the crew had any possibility to &#13;
        save the ship and alert the passengers. <b>Probably the entire course &#13;
        of events - with the bow visor coming loose, the pushed-out bow ramp, &#13;
        and the ripped-up side of the hull </b>- took place very quickly. The &#13;
        officers on the bridge didn't have many minutes until so much water had &#13;
        entered, that the ship was not possible to save. <br/>&#13;
        Why, then, has not the bow visor been found in the proximity of the wreck? &#13;
        The Finnish Coast Guard has been looking along the route close to Estonia, &#13;
        but hasn't found anything.<b> The Commission is convinced that the visor &#13;
        doesn't lie in the area close to the wreck</b>, where one has been looking. &#13;
        A possibility is, that it all happened so fast that the visor simply lies &#13;
        under the wreck and therefore will not be found until the wreck - possibly &#13;
        - will be salvaged."</font></p>&#13;
      <blockquote> &#13;
        <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Note:</b> Hellberg &#13;
          obviously means damage to the ship's hull not caused by the actuators &#13;
          when cutting through the front bulkheads and Sten Andersson's reply &#13;
          indicates that he refers to damage by which massive water ingress on &#13;
          to the car deck is possible. Hellberg has just a vague idea but confronts &#13;
          Andersson with information about big damage to the hull's side. If Andersson &#13;
          had not been aware about such damage he would have corrected Hellberg &#13;
          imme-diately. But Andersson did not reject it and let it pass. Thus &#13;
          it was published and stands up to day uncorrected. Hellberg furthermore &#13;
          writes in his article that "the scraping noises heard by survivors from &#13;
          the 1st deck might have been caused by the visor drifting along the &#13;
          vessel's hull side" which became indeed part of the JAIC scenario. This &#13;
          cannot have been possible because according to the <i>"Floatability &#13;
          Calculations of the Visor"</i> by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg, &#13;
          the visor sank as soon as it became detached from the vessel - <a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank">see &#13;
          Subchapter 34.11 </a>- which was only when the vessel was heeling from &#13;
          90° to upside down, i.e. approximately when the heel was 130°/140° - &#13;
          <a href="chapter31.htm" target="_blank">see Chapter 31</a> - the Casualty &#13;
          Scenario. </font></p>&#13;
      </blockquote>&#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Although such a hole &#13;
        could have explained the sinking and, in particular, the way the ferry &#13;
        sank, it was completely ignored by the JAIC in their press conference &#13;
        and in all internal and external publications. However, not all of the &#13;
        relatives forgot about the Hellberg article in DN and especially those &#13;
        who had made own observations which could lead towards a hole in the side &#13;
        of the ferry remained very interested and followed this up whenever possible. &#13;
        This occurred for example at a big meeting at Karlberg Castle on 13 March &#13;
        1996 when Johan Fransson from Sjöfartsverket was asked whether there was &#13;
        a hole in the starboard side. His answer was: <i>"Yes there is a hole &#13;
        in the starboard side, but I don't know anything about it - please the &#13;
        next question!"</i> This was said in the presence of many relatives, journalists &#13;
        and survivors, among them Rolf Sörman, who reported on the meeting at &#13;
        the Styrelse for Psychological Försvar (Board of Psychological Defence) &#13;
        on 9 June 1999 when the survivors Mikael Öun, Sarah Hedrenius, Sten Jolind &#13;
        and himself met with Johan Fransson, Per Nordström from Sjöfartsverket &#13;
        and some people from the SPF. Rolf Sörman asked Johan Fransson again whether &#13;
        there was a hole in the starboard side and his answer was "yes": However &#13;
        the "hole" had disappeared to the public and was completely covered by &#13;
        the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström and his colleagues &#13;
        which was presented to the public. </font></p>&#13;

      The Hearing of the Survivors </b></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Finnish police took &#13;
      statements of all the survivors brought to Finland - sometimes two or three &#13;
      statements - during which one of the standard questions to the survivors &#13;
      was: <i>Did you note or feel explosions?" </i>The Swedish survivors were &#13;
      interviewed by local policemen in their home cities or villages, who in &#13;
      most cases were not trained to ask the proper questions for a maritime investigation. &#13;
      This resulted in the disappearance of valuable evidence forever, a procedure &#13;
      which as such was accepted by the Swedish part of the JAIC as well as by &#13;
      the investigating public prosecutor. There is evidence that SÄPO (Security &#13;
      Police) officials tried to persuade survivors to change their statements &#13;
      in regard to particular matters. Some followed, very few did not. All the &#13;
      statements were in the early stage declared "classified" by prosecutor Birgitta &#13;
      Cronier, however, were declassified sometime in 1995. The statements were &#13;
      sent to Estonia on 17 October 1994 and were received by the Swedish part &#13;
      of the JAIC on 20 October 1994. <br/>&#13;
            In Estonia the crew survivors were frequently &#13;
      heard by the Criminal Police, the Security Police and subsequently by a &#13;
      transport investigation office in addition to being heard several times &#13;
      by Estonian members of the JAIC. According to the statements available the &#13;
      Estonian passenger survivors however were heard only once. <br/>&#13;
            The Estonian statements were sent to the &#13;
      Swedish and Finnish police and translated subsequently into the respective &#13;
      languages. The Swedish versions were received by the JAIC on 1 December &#13;
      1994 and are available together with some of the Estonian originals to this &#13;
      'Group of Experts'. A comparison of the Estonian originals with the translations &#13;
      revealed that the Swedish text is substantially shorter and relevant parts &#13;
      of the originals were not translated at all. It is, of course, unknown to &#13;
      this 'Group of Experts' whether this occurred just due to sloppiness of &#13;
      the translator or was done deliberately. The statement of Ain-Alar Juhanson &#13;
      taken by the Central Criminal Police of Tallinn, at Tallinn airport on 29 &#13;
      September 1994 at 17.10 hours shall serve as one of many examples: <br/>&#13;
      The translation from the Estonian original reads as follows:</font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Before the catastrophe &#13;
        I was on Deck 2 in cabin 1056 of the ferry 'Estonia'. The vessel left &#13;
        her berth in Tallinn, at 19.00 hours. Our group consisted of 4 sportsmen. &#13;
        Myself, Anti Arak, Kristjan Rainend, Jaak Pehk are athletes. Ülle Karo &#13;
        was responsible for our massage. We were underway with a Mercedes bus &#13;
        without driver. Our bus was one of the last taken on to the car deck. &#13;
        I do not know how the bus was secured. The driver was K. Rainend who had &#13;
        driven the bus on to the car deck. We had a double cabin but we were 4. &#13;
        The cabin no. was 1056. Ülle Karo had bought a 1-person ticket for this &#13;
        cabin. We four others had deck tickets. The cabin was in the middle of &#13;
        the ship. I cannot define exactly, I was unable to orientate myself on &#13;
        the vessel. At the moment of the catastrophe we were in cabin 1056. Myself, &#13;
        Arak, Rainend and Ü. Karo. I do not know in which cabin Pehk was. We all &#13;
        slept.<br/>&#13;
              There was a high sea state prevailing. &#13;
        The waves were beating against the vessel, there was strong wind. I woke &#13;
        up by a heavy metal bang. I felt that the vessel heeled immediately to &#13;
        the right side. I was sleeping on the floor. Prior to this metallic bang &#13;
        I did not hear anything in particular due to the noises of the engines. &#13;
        As a result of the bang we all woke up. It was clear to us that something &#13;
        particularly extraordinary had occurred. I took my Texas trousers, my &#13;
        shirt and left the cabin. All the passengers were already in the alleyway. &#13;
        It appeared that some water was already in the alleyway. All four of us &#13;
        then went up the stairs to the deck - I was the first one. The vessel &#13;
        continued to heel to the right. On the stairs there were only few people, &#13;
        but up at the doors it was quite full. There was full panic. Everybody &#13;
        was screaming: "What shall we do?" At this time everywhere the light was &#13;
        on and in my opinion also the engines were still running. Only very few &#13;
        managed to reach the railing. Not everybody managed to get out of the &#13;
        foyer. Myself, Arak and Rainend managed to reach the railing. After we &#13;
        had reached the railing I heard a female voice shouting over the loudspeakers &#13;
        2 or 3 times the word "Alarm" in Estonian language. At this time there &#13;
        was still light. Arak and myself stayed for a while at the railing. There &#13;
        was a strong storm. Suddenly the vessel heeled heavily to the right, the &#13;
        heel reached almost 90°. Then we heard the siren and the light went out. &#13;
        We climbed on to the side of the vessel and tried, depending on the heel &#13;
        of the vessel, to have a firm hold beneath our feet. Together with us &#13;
        many people had climbed on to the side of the vessel. Rainend did put &#13;
        on a lifevest whilst holding on to the railing. There were many lifevests. &#13;
        Together with Arak we tried to fabricate a raft from lifevests. We succeeded &#13;
        but did not manage to lift the raft on to the vessel's side. There were &#13;
        a number of rubber boats floating around in the waves. I cannot say when &#13;
        the ship's engines stopped. Together with Arak we estimated that in case &#13;
        we would jump into the water to reach one of the lifeboats we would be &#13;
        smashed against the vessel by the waves coming in from this side. There &#13;
        was a heavy storm. We then moved towards the bow. We could see that the &#13;
        bow was damaged. At the bow I climbed along some sort of grids downwards &#13;
        together with Arak. To the water's surface remained some 10 m and hand-in-hand &#13;
        we jumped. We swam about 100 m away from the vessel to avoid being sucked &#13;
        down by the vessel. Due to the high waves we were unable to save ourselves &#13;
        on the rafts. We had both put on lifevests when we were standing at the &#13;
        railing and now were swimming together until we saw a white cabinet. The &#13;
        doors of the cabinet were closed. We climbed on top of it. I do not know &#13;
        how long we were on the cabinet. We were able to hold ourselves to the &#13;
        handles of the cabinet. In the moonlight we saw the vessel. The distance &#13;
        was approximately 150 m. Finally we managed to reach a rubber boat. After &#13;
        about 3-4 hours we were picked up by a helicopter. Together with Arak &#13;
        I was rescued. I cannot say what happened to the others.<br/>&#13;
              I had not been on the car deck to check &#13;
        our bus during the catastrophe." </i></font></p>&#13;

        Benz bus. Our bus was one of the last placed onto the car deck. I do not &#13;
        know how the bus was secured to the car deck. The bus driver was Kristjan &#13;
        Rainend. Ülle Karo had bought the ticket for cabin 1056. The other 4 had &#13;
        deck passenger tickets. The cabin was in the middle of the vessel, where &#13;
        exactly I cannot say because I could not orientate myself. All 4 of us &#13;

        from the vessel. The moon was shining and therefore we could see the vessel. &#13;
        Finally we reached a rubber boat. Together with Arak I managed to get &#13;
        in. I do not know what happened to the others. I was not on the car deck &#13;

      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Swedish translation &#13;
        is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.5.446.2.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
        Enclosure 36.5.446.2. </a><br/>&#13;
             It is quite obvious that the Swedish text &#13;
        by far does not contain the information stated in the original, thus the &#13;
        psychological expert to the Swedish JAIC Bengt Schager, who was to summarize &#13;
        all statements for the other JAIC members and experts, was not in a position &#13;
        to evaluate the full evidence of this important witness. He could therefore &#13;
        not question him further about his observations at the damaged bow.<br/>&#13;
              It is evident that very important evidence &#13;
        remained unknown to the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
        In any event, the JAIC relied on the statements of the survivors mainly &#13;
        taken by policemen untrained for maritime casualties and refrained from &#13;
        the taking of own statements. <br/>&#13;
              As a matter of fact, the JAIC only heard &#13;
        a couple of the crew members whom they considered to be the key witnesses, &#13;
        which they actually were and still are, however, they did not tell the &#13;
        truth or, at least, not the full truth. They were - as it could be expected &#13;
        - very loyal to their owners ESCO and N&amp;T. The many passenger survivors &#13;
        having made numerous valuable observations were not heard by the JAIC, &#13;
        except for one or two. Instead the psychological expert to the Swedish &#13;
        part of the JAIC, Bengt Schager, was instructed to make summaries from &#13;
        available statements which were then handed to the other members and experts &#13;
        and on the basis of which they formed their opinion about the developments &#13;
        onboard and about the casualty sequence of events. These summaries were &#13;
        complied in such a way that for example water observed on deck 1 was not &#13;
        even mentioned in the first version. <br/>&#13;
              When Kari Lethola was interviewed by Jutta &#13;
        Rabe of SPIEGEL TV in May 1996 and was also confronted with certain survivor &#13;
        statements, e.g. Carl Övberg, he stated that they (the Finnish part of &#13;
        the JAIC) did not have the complete statements, but just "Summaries" made &#13;
        by Bengt Schager. In the course of the further interview it turned out &#13;
        that the JAIC had not taken the statements of any passengers themselves. &#13;
        Nevertheless it turned out that Lethola knew the Övberg statement about &#13;
        the hydraulic noises heard, which, according to Lethola, were caused by &#13;
        the visor actuators when the visor was opening/closing after the locks &#13;
        were broken.<br/>&#13;
              According to Stenström the noises were &#13;
        caused by the stabilisers. Lethola subsequently confirmed that the JAIC &#13;
        did everything to prove in the best possible manner that the hypothetical &#13;
        scenario developed by Stenström less than 4 weeks after the casualty is &#13;
        the real one and that consequently the locking devices of the visor, allegedly &#13;
        under-dimensioned, were the main cause of the casualty. In a subsequent &#13;
        interview after his resignation from the JAIC Bengt Schager told Jutta &#13;
        Rabe among other things: </font></p>&#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Q:</b> I was told &#13;
        that you were first asked to make summaries of the statements and then &#13;
        later again, more or less, to count statements which were talking about &#13;
        a detailed time line, so that one could know when there was water under &#13;
        the car deck, etc.? <br/><b>A</b>: Oh yes, when I made my first version we suddenly came across &#13;
        that new things were important, on which I had not put any emphasis before, &#13;
        for example, we have the reports about water on deck 1 and I knew there &#13;
        were reports about water on deck 1 and I was again re-reading this in &#13;
        a more thorough way and put it into my summary as it was said, because &#13;
        it could prove to be important after the shipbuilders report. I did not &#13;
        know, when I started my first version that this could be very important, &#13;
        that the actual wording had to be put there. <br/><b>Q:</b> Did it affect in some way? <br/><b>A:</b> No, it was more ... I knew at that time that we believed that &#13;
        the accident started with water on car deck. We had reports of small amounts &#13;
        of water, trickles really, on deck no. 1, but then people came out publicly &#13;
        and said that the accident started with water on deck 1 and then it is &#13;
        obvious that I had to rewrite it in a way that is clear that the data &#13;
        we have does not support such an idea. <br/><b>Q:</b> So, from the existing statements you did not get that impression? &#13;
        <br/><b>A</b>: That's correct.<br/><b>Q: </b>You have not been able to talk to passengers who had seen water &#13;
        under the car deck and asked them again?<br/><b>A:</b> No. " </i></font></p>&#13;
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Had the JAIC questioned &#13;
        Carl Övberg and Carl-Erik Reintamm they would have become quickly aware &#13;
        that there had been a lot of water on deck 1, even before the big heel, &#13;
        and that the water had penetrated the 1st deck with substantial pressure &#13;

      A: Yes, I saw water on the monitor. I don't know when it started to penetrate. &#13;
      The height of the water was above the roofs of the personal cars. <br/>&#13;
      12. Q: <b>Did you see whether the hatch burst open by explosion (was blown &#13;
      open)? </b><br/>&#13;
      A: Don't know. Was in control room and asked: Shall we leave? Went out through &#13;
      the watertight door. Did not close the door because certain personnel stayed &#13;
      behind. <br/>&#13;
      13. Q: Why did you leave? Heel or water on car deck?<br/>&#13;
      A: General feeling that something did happen. The emergency generator started &#13;
      when they pulled themselves up. 15-20 seconds after they came out everything &#13;
      became dark. Injured his hands at a hot boiler in the engine room when it &#13;
      was dark. <br/>&#13;
      14. Q: How long did it take from everything normal until leaving the vessel? &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      A: Ca. 30 minutes. From the bridge came as long as Kadak was in the engine &#13;
      control room: Can you correct the list? Are the engines OK?" </font></p>&#13;

    were also published in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 06.10.94, however, without the &#13;
    question whether the bow ramp was blown open by an explosion. <br/>&#13;
       Much to the surprise of the Finnish and Swedish members &#13;
    the interrogations were suddenly interrupted by Andi Meister at this time, &#13;
    allegedly because their plane would be waiting, which was a poor excuse as &#13;
    the plane - owned by the Estonian Coast Guard - would have waited as long &#13;
    as required. <br/>&#13;
          The manner which Andi Meister chose to end &#13;
    the first meeting of the JAIC caused considerable irritation with the Swedish &#13;
    and Finnish members. <br/>&#13;
    This was reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on the next day - 30.09.94 - as follows: &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Political manipulations &#13;
      disturb casualty investigation. Estonian Minister blamed for forcing important &#13;
      questioning of survivors</b>.<br/>&#13;
      The Estonian chairman of the JAIC, Transport Minister Andi Meister, is committing &#13;
      political manipulations which have already done damage to the work of the &#13;
      JAIC. <br/>&#13;
      Due to the pressure resulting from forthcoming elections in Estonia he forced &#13;
      the first questioning of surviving crew members in Turku. "Therewith Meister, &#13;
      having absolutely no experience with casualty investigation, has already &#13;
      proved that he is unsuitable to lead the work", a source said. <br/>&#13;
      Both the Swedish and the Finnish members of the JAIC are irritated about &#13;
      the Estonian chairman's stopping the first interrogations held in Turku &#13;
      on Wednesday. The JAIC had selected 3 crew members who were considered to &#13;
      be the most interesting to be questioned: <br/>&#13;
      - AB sailor Silver Linde, who went the last watch-round, just an hour before &#13;
      the casualty, and who subsequently received instructions from the vessel's &#13;
      command to go down to the car deck to find out what was happening there, &#13;
      just before the vessel took the heavy list and sank. <br/>&#13;
      - Engineer Henrik Sillaste who saw on the TV monitor in the engine room &#13;
      that water was streaming onto the deck. <br/>&#13;
      - the third witness was a motorman.<br/>&#13;
      Interrogating the three has revealed valuable information. For the JAIC &#13;
      it was very important to hear their reports and to put forward their questions &#13;
      without haste and pressure. Therefore the behaviour of the Estonian Transport &#13;
      Minister "is, at least, strange", said one of the Swedish participants. &#13;
      "He made it understood, powerfully and determinedly, that the interrogation &#13;
      should be stopped so that he could go back on the plane waiting at the airport &#13;
      of Turku." The plane had been chartered by the Foreign Ministry to take &#13;
      survivors home to Tallinn. "We carried out the questioning as well as possible. &#13;
      Finally we understood that we were compelled to end the interrogation - &#13;
      the plane was waiting", said one of the investigators. Various different &#13;
      sources have confirmed the picture. <b>In addition, the Transport Minister &#13;
      had made it quite clear that he wished a quick investigation.</b> "He believes &#13;
      in his naiveté that the investigation can be finalised within two weeks". &#13;
      It was apparently the intention of the Minister to present the investigation &#13;
      report on the 'Estonia' casualty before the change of government in Estonia &#13;
      which was forthcoming. Upon the question of the Transport Minister Meister &#13;
      to Olof Forssberg, head of the three-man Swedish part of the JAIC, as to &#13;
      how long it would take until the investigation is completed, Forssberg replied: &#13;
      "About 1 year." "This answer left him considerably surprised", said one &#13;
      source. "No perspective, no experience. He obviously has never had anything &#13;
      to do with qualified casualty investigations", said another participant &#13;
      at the Turku meeting."<br/><b>Note: </b>When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe, Andi Meister said among &#13;
      other things: "I thought it was not the best decision to appoint me as chairman &#13;
      because of my position." </i></font></p>&#13;

    were made to DAGENS NYHETER and published on 29.09.94:<br/>&#13;
    Kari Lethola refused to make a statement as to the possible cause of the casualty, &#13;
    but said: <i>"However, since there is a bulkhead between the port and starboard &#13;
    side of the car deck, shifting of cargo can be excluded ..... " </i><br/><b>Note:</b> He means the centre casing.<br/>&#13;
    Also Carl Bildt did not wish to speculate on the causes, but stated that <i>"it &#13;

      the Stockholm archipelago. "The 4 inspections carried out by the Swedish &#13;
      Sjöfartsinspektionen did not include the condition of visor and bow ramp. &#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In the evening the Swedish &#13;
    Embassy in Moscow sent by fax an ITAR-TASS message from St. Petersburg with &#13;
    the following wording: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"St. Petersburg September &#13;
      29 TAS - by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev. Rumyantsev: A Russian underwater &#13;
      expert believes people may still be alive inside the 'Estonia' ferry which &#13;
      capsized in the Baltic Sea on Wednesday and lies at a depth of 80-90 metres.<br/>&#13;
      "Hundreds of people remaining inside the sunken ferry can be saved and should &#13;
      be saved." Anatoly Kuteinikov, designer general of the St. Petersburg based &#13;
      'Malakhit' company told TASS on Thursday. The company is the leading Russian &#13;
      defence enterprise producing underwater craft. <br/>&#13;
      He said that an "air cushion" always accompanies any shipwreck and may allow &#13;
      those remaining inside the ferry to stay alive for at least a week.<br/>&#13;
      "One should not be scared by the excessive pressure. 80 metres are not too &#13;
      deep", Kuteinikov said. <br/>&#13;
      He regretted that the Finnish and Swedish authorities had not requested &#13;
      the Russian rescuers to help with the 'Estonia' shipwreck. "We have a big &#13;
      experience in underwater work, as well as good and maybe the best equipment. &#13;
      It is a pity that we did not join efforts. Moreover, there are our citizens &#13;
      in distress", Kuteinikov complained. The chief designer believes that the &#13;
      main cause of the disaster was a poor training level of the crew. Besides, &#13;
      it is also clear that the ship had some design faults. "Ships of the 'Estonia' &#13;
      class do not sink in five minutes. They can overturn, but should stay afloat &#13;
      for several hours to a whole day", he said." </i></font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The JAIC continued their &#13;
    endeavours to confirm their hypothetical casualty scenario and to improve &#13;
    the argumentation and evidence in favour of it. It was planned to publish &#13;
    a detailed technical Part-Report as soon as possible. Regular press statements &#13;
    in line with the above strengthened the public opinion in the Nordic countries &#13;
    that the main blame for the catastrophe rested with the builders, Meyer Werft &#13;
    in Papenburg. <br/>&#13;
          This caused the Managing Director of the yard, &#13;
    Bernard Meyer, to instruct his lawyer, Dr. Peter Holtappels, to form an own &#13;
    team of experts to investigate the real causes for the sinking of the ESTONIA. &#13;

    The German 'Group of Experts'</font></b></p>&#13;
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Dr. Peter Holtappels, senior &#13;
    lawyer with the law firm Ahlers &amp; Vogel, Hamburg, became the chairman of the &#13;
    new team and engaged Prof. Dr. Eike Lehmann from the Technical University, &#13;
    Hamburg, to perform the investigation from the Naval Architect's point of &#13;
    view and Captain Werner Hummel, Marine Consultant and Managing Director of &#13;
    Marine Claims Partner (Germany) GmbH, Hamburg was engaged to investigate the &#13;
    visor condition, the ESTONIA berths in Tallinn and Stockholm and collect all &#13;
    information relevant to the casualty. In addition, Captain Håkan Karlsson &#13;
    from Mariehamn/Åland Islands was engaged in his capacity as one of two masters &#13;
    having been in charge of the ESTONIA for about 12 years. Simultaneously Meyer &#13;
    Werft nominated a member of its Design and Construction Department, Naval &#13;
    Architect Dipl. Ing. Tomas Wilkendorf as co-ordinator of the internal yard &#13;
    investigation and link to the 'Group of Experts'. Already the first of three &#13;
    inspections of the visor in Hangö revealed: <br/>&#13;
       - that the visor, although well painted from the outside, &#13;
    was in an extremely bad maintenance condition; - that the starboard visor &#13;
       hinge had been in a very poor condition already before the &#13;
    casualty with deep burning marks and fatigue crack propagations in    way &#13;
    of the broken parts of the visor arm and elsewhere; <br/>&#13;
       - that numerous water marks inside the visor indicated that &#13;
    the visor had been water-filled at sea up to different levels obviously    depending &#13;
    on the outside water height, i.e. that the visor had not been weather tight;<br/>&#13;
       - that the (lowest) 3rd stringer was covered with oil on &#13;
    which fresh footprints were visible indicating substantial activity inside &#13;
    the    visor after the water had left the visor the last time &#13;
    before it was lifted ashore in Hangö, i.e. before the last arrival at respectively &#13;
       after the last departure from Tallinn. <br/>&#13;
    The areas in the aft bulkheads of the visor, where the lugs of the hydraulic &#13;
    side locks had been located, were already burnt out and taken to Stockholm. &#13;
    The starboard hooks of the manual side locks were crushed while the port ones &#13;
    were intact and just bent slightly together. <br/>&#13;
          The big lug fitted to the after part of the &#13;
    heavily damaged visor bottom was in place but almost cracked off the visor. &#13;
    This lug was part of the Atlantic lock. For further details see <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;
    30</a>. <br/>&#13;
         In brief, it was very obvious that this was not a &#13;
    normal and properly maintained visor, but a misaligned, leaking structure &#13;
    with poorly treated and thus considerably weakened hinges and manual locks, &#13;
    which apparently had not been engaged. The numerous footprints on the 3rd &#13;
    and to some extent on the 2nd stringer indicated quite some activities inside &#13;
    the closed visor which is unusual because the only installation inside the &#13;
    visor, the Atlantic lock, was normally operated remote controlled from the &#13;
    car deck. <br/>&#13;
          Two days later at a fortuitous meeting with &#13;
    Uno Laur in his Tallinn office, he explained the following: <br/>&#13;
    - the visor was leaking and at sea full to the outside water level; <br/>&#13;
    - the hydraulic installation of the Atlantic lock was leaking as "did all &#13;
    hydraulic installations on older vessels", thus hydraulic oil was swimming &#13;
    on top of the water surface inside the visor when the vessel was at sea;<br/>&#13;
    - the hydraulic oil caused the water marks inside the visor and, when the &#13;
    speed was lowered, the water left the visor through the gaps in the bottom &#13;
    and the oil settled down on the stringers, frames and on the bottom - see &#13;
    also Subchapters <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4.</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.;</a><br/>&#13;
    - as the Atlantic lock had suffered badly during the last ice winter (January &#13;
    to March 1994) when the crew had to hack to pieces the ice inside the frozen &#13;
    visor, it could no more be opened and closed by the hydraulic cylinder, but &#13;
    this had to be done manually by hammering; <br/>&#13;
    - therefore each time before arrival at Tallinn two crew members went down &#13;
    and hammered the bolt open and after Tallinn they hammered the bolt closed &#13;
    - see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a>. <br/><b>Note</b>: At that time it was unknown to this 'Group of Experts' that the &#13;
    sensors had been dismounted because they were also damaged by the ice hacking &#13;
    and as long as crew members were going down to hammer open or closed the bolt &#13;
    of the Atlantic lock it was not required to renew the sensors, which were &#13;
    anyway hindering the hammering. This was at least the opinion of N&amp;T as technical &#13;
    managers of the ferry. Had it been known, Uno Laur would certainly have been &#13;
    asked as well and he would probably have told the real background. Now it &#13;
    took some months longer before a Finnish engineer with a friend among the &#13;
    2nd crew of the ESTONIA relayed the information that the sensors had been &#13;
    dismantled because they were damaged and were causing short circuits in the &#13;
    electrical system of the car deck and as each time when the Atlantic lock &#13;
    had to be opened or closed the crew members went down to do the job, the sensors &#13;
    were not needed. Before this background it is of course understandable that &#13;
    Stenström threw the already recovered bolt of the Atlantic lock back into &#13;
    the sea, because it clearly showed the hammering marks and also two different &#13;
    contact marks indicating that the bolt had sometimes been fully closed and &#13;
    sometimes only partly closed which has nevertheless been clearly established &#13;
    from the available video footage. It is also understandable that Stenström &#13;
    ordered the divers to burn off the sensor plate and to clip off the cut ends &#13;
    of the sensor cables and subsequently throw both to the bottom of the sea &#13;
    consisting of soft clay where they disappeared forever (see Subchapters <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, &#13;
    <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27.1</a> and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> In any event, it was now &#13;
    quite clear that the publications and statements by the JAIC were, if at all, &#13;
    only part of the truth and that the crew and possibly also owners/technical &#13;
    managers of the ferry had had difficulties with exactly these locking devices &#13;
    which - according to the JAIC - had triggered off the casualty sequence-of-events &#13;
    by their failure. <br/>&#13;
          The new information was evaluated and discussed &#13;
    and by fax of 20 January Dr. Holtappels suggested a meeting with the JAIC &#13;
    to which Börje Stenström replied on 20 January among other things:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Appreciate the opportunity &#13;
      to get views from a group of experts from your side, the commission is certainly &#13;
      open for any constructive comments on the development of the accident. For &#13;
      your information the full commission will have a meeting in Helsinki on &#13;
      26-27 January. We do not expect to have any press conference but questions &#13;
      from media are unavoidable. The official view of SHK was published in a &#13;
      news release via the Swedish press news agency a week ago, stating that &#13;
      the report of the commission was delayed because more time had been allowed &#13;
      to the yard to complete their investigations, metallurgical investigations &#13;
      were still going on in Stockholm and the commission had initiated a second &#13;
      look at the weather conditions and in particular any specific wave conditions &#13;
      at the site of the accident." </i></font></p>&#13;

      from the shipyard have not yet been received. The members and experts are &#13;
      working on the report concerning the bow visor. When the draft report is &#13;
      ready it will be sent to the commission members and experts. Tuomo Karppinen &#13;

    By fax of 7 February Stenström requested the following:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;

      You indicated that the assembly consisting of the locking plunger housing &#13;
      and the lugs should have been a shop assembly, properly welded. As far as &#13;
      I recall one of the engineers attending our last meeting at Papenburg (presumably &#13;
      a shop engineer) confirmed the weld was a normal installation weld. We have &#13;
      no detailed drawing of the bottom lock assembly except as shown in drawing &#13;
      number 49111-373. In case there is a shipyard drawing showing such an pre-fabricated &#13;

      3. Damage to rubber seals. As far as we understand, the heavy stem post &#13;
      on front of the visor rests against the fixed continuation on the stem/bulbous &#13;
      vow. This determines the vertical position of the visor in closed position &#13;
      and any change of the steel work at the rubber seals would not change the &#13;
      vertical position of the visor. In checking with inspectors who had been &#13;

      According to information from Tallinn the bolt of the lock could not be &#13;

      given to us as explanation for the oil spill inside the visor and the many &#13;
      footsteps on the 2nd and 3rd stringers. We were also told that ever since &#13;
      then the bolt was closed and opened manually.<br/>&#13;
      We have spoken with a number of ex crew members about this, but everybody &#13;
      feels it difficult to believe that the bolt can be handled manually the &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">2. They are expecting a<b> &#13;
    solely technical discussion </b>and from the German side the answers to the &#13;
    questions raised by them already in November. <br/>&#13;
    3. <b>Video material</b>: At first the Finns had sent down a ROV to the wreck &#13;
    which took better pictures than the divers did. The video sent to the yard &#13;
    does not contain ROV pictures which will, however, be made available, if requested. &#13;
    The film sent to the yard had been made by an English diving team having examined &#13;
    the wreck for 80-90 hours from a Norwegian semi-submersible (belonging to &#13;
    the Norwegian Smit-Tak subsidiary) by order of the Swedish Maritime Administration. &#13;
    The aim was to obtain material for a feasibility study in respect of the lifting &#13;
    possibilities. Subsequently the divers were available to the JAIC for another &#13;
    ca. 10 hours for examination of the foreship. Thereby Stenström has personally &#13;
    directed the divers via a monitor and had a close eye on them all the time. &#13;
    He excludes that the divers have dismounted the sensors of the Atlantic lock &#13;
    (therefore it is established that this must have occurred before the casualty). &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    4.<b> Recovered objects</b>: The divers have dismounted respectively burnt &#13;
    off the well known parts including the bolt of the Atlantic lock. When they &#13;
    were preparing the helicopter flight back some parts had to be left behind &#13;
    due to weight restrictions. As the bolt did not show any changes except for &#13;
    some notchings, it was left behind on the diving support vessel. He assumes &#13;
    that the bolt has been thrown overboard in the meantime (weight ca. 25 kg). &#13;
    The other parts will be shown to us tomorrow. We will receive name and contact &#13;
    of the owners of the diving support vessel and shall find out where the bolt &#13;
    actually is. <br/>&#13;
    5. <b>Surviving crew members:</b> in total about 30, of whom only 4 were on &#13;
    watch, i.e. 1 engineer, 2 motormen, 1 decksman (name: Silver Linde). He was &#13;
    sent twice from the bridge to the car deck to check whether the ramp was still &#13;
    tight. The last time was shortly before the catastrophe, the green lights &#13;
    were always on. <br/>&#13;
    6. <b>Atlantic lock</b>: As it had been assumed already they had not spent &#13;
    much thought on it. The lugs are obviously broken an that is sufficient for &#13;
    them, they thought. They have not yet realised that:<br/>&#13;
    - the sensors were obviously dismounted before the casualty;<br/>&#13;
    - the actuator as well as the bolt were turned about 90° towards aft; <br/>&#13;
    - the port hydraulic hose was torn off. <br/>&#13;
    They have no explanation for the oil spill on the lowest stringer of the visor &#13;
    nor for the many footprints (also the technicians from N&amp;T do not). On the &#13;
    other hand, it is not in doubt that the heavy weather securings were not engaged.<br/>&#13;
    7. <b>2 Swedish inspectors </b>have indeed inspected the vessel on the departure &#13;
    day together with 9 Estonian trainees, however, they cannot give relevant &#13;
    information. <br/><b>Note</b>: This means that Stenström began the "cooperation" with this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' with two untrue statements, namely: <br/>&#13;
    (a) he alleged to have left the bolt onboard, although actually he had personally &#13;
    thrown it overboard; and<br/>&#13;
    (b) he stated that the two inspectors had no relevant information, although &#13;
    at that time he had known for more than 3 months that those inspectors had &#13;
    found such grave deficiencies on the ferry that they had tried to stop her &#13;
    from sailing - see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a> &#13;

    Stockholm on 16/17 February and was attended by the persons mentioned on the &#13;
    previous pages.<br/>&#13;
    Stenström advised that it was not the aim of the JAIC to blame somebody for &#13;
    the casualty, but to establish the facts, i.e. the causes, and to issue recommendations &#13;
    for the future which should avoid a repetition. He emphasized that the Swedish &#13;
    part of the JAIC - Statens Havarie Kommission - is completely independent &#13;
    and comparable to the U.S. National Transportation Board, while the Finnish &#13;
    part, headed by its permanent chairman Kari Lethola, was attached to the Ministry &#13;
    of Justice and the Estonian part was formed exclusively for this investigation.<br/>&#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Note</b>: This means &#13;
      not more and not less but that the <b>JAIC had considered its investigation &#13;
      as to the causes, sequence-of-events and conclusions finalised, no matter &#13;
      what would come up in the course of the year</b>. As a matter of fact, that &#13;
      is what the JAIC upheld until the Final Report was finally published in &#13;
      December 1997. <b>This also means, however, that the JAIC had established &#13;
      its firm opinion on the causes, the sequence-of-events and the conclusions &#13;
      already before 17 October 1994</b>, as on this day the causes, the sequence-of-events &#13;
      and the conclusions, though in slightly different wording, were submitted &#13;
      to the public for the first time. The reader is reminded that this was on &#13;
      the 19th day after the casualty and prior to the visor being lifted and &#13;
      brought ashore. The reader is left with his own conclusion on the merits &#13;
      of such investigation by Swedish authorities into an accident which has &#13;
      cost hundreds of fellow citizens their life. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The open questions concerning &#13;
    the locking devices of the visor were discussed in detail and in every thinkable &#13;
    direction, however, whenever maintenance matters were discussed uncertainty &#13;
    came up especially on the Estonian side. <br/>&#13;
         Upon a respective question the Finnish and Swedish &#13;
    JAIC members explained that interrogation of the Estonian crew members as &#13;
    well as all questions concerning the vessel, the shipping company, the organisation &#13;
    and operation were exclusively dealt with by the Estonian JAIC member, Uno &#13;
    Laur, because the other two members were the Transport Minister and the Head &#13;
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO who could not - or only restrictively &#13;
    - participate in the daily work.<br/>&#13;
         The results are obvious: Only that information &#13;
    was passed to the Swedish/Finnish JAIC which did not affect Estonian interests &#13;
    or which was already public. It was thus not surprising that the same Uno &#13;
    Laur who had explained to a member of this 'Group of Experts' only 4 weeks &#13;
    earlier - in the presence of one of his Finnish clients - why the footprints &#13;
    were in the oil on the stringer, now tried to convince the audience that the &#13;
    Atlantic lock had been operated hydraulically up to the end. It became obvious &#13;
    in the course of the two days that the JAIC had not even considered to investigate &#13;
    the condition of the vessel before her last departure and was content with &#13;
    their hypothetical cause consideration and casualty sequence-of-events which &#13;
    - "so sorry" - did put the blame almost entirely on the builders. <br/>&#13;
          During the meeting, the personal talks with &#13;
    the Finnish participants and, in particular, with Börje Stenström were very &#13;
    open in response to the many questions concerning the circumstances of the &#13;
    casualty, the route, weather, crew and all the many relevant details of which &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' knew practically nothing, but which were of crucial &#13;
    importance for the investigation. The Estonian participants in the discussions &#13;
    tried to do everything to avoid the creation of a bad impression of vessel &#13;
    and crew. When for example the subject "ice damage to vessel and visor" was &#13;
    raised because the visor had obviously at least two quite heavy old damages, &#13;
    Uno Laur said: <i>"It was a very, very mild winter. What should have happened. &#13;
    Moreover the vessel had ice class 1A.</i>" Actually the Gulf of Finland and &#13;
    the Middle and Northern Baltic were covered by thick ice from the end of January &#13;
    to the beginning of April 1994 - see Subchapter 12.4.2 - and the ferry had &#13;
    frequently been used as an "ice breaker". </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The hypothetical scenario &#13;
    of the JAIC had, however, serious weaknesses and some of them became very &#13;
    apparent at the meeting. These were mainly: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(a) the condition of the &#13;
      locking devices as found;<br/>&#13;
      (b) the uncertainty whether the locking devices were still original; <br/>&#13;
      (c) the apparent fact that the maintenance and damage history of visor, &#13;
      bow ramp, its locking devices and hinges had not been examined at all before &#13;
      arriving at and going public with their scenario and the conclusions therefrom; &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      (d) the apparent fact that visor seals were missing/damaged and the visor &#13;
      had been full of water to the outside level at sea with (then) unknown consequences. &#13;
      </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Being so sure about their &#13;
    scenario the Finns for example agreed to the visor condition as explained &#13;
    under (d) above, while Stenström and the Estonians smelled trouble and were &#13;
    reluctant. In any event, Karppinen and Rahka fully agreed that the visor had &#13;
    always been full of water at sea, however later with-drew from this admission &#13;
    completely, when they realised what consequences water in the visor had in &#13;
    combination with a damaged bow ramp: water on the car deck. <br/>&#13;
          At the JAIC meeting in March in Tallinn among &#13;
    other things also the protocol of the statement of the nautical student Rain &#13;
    Oolmets to the criminal police in Tallinn made already on 03.10.94, i.e. 6 &#13;
    months before, was handed over to the Swedes/Finns. The reason for the long &#13;
    delay in presenting this important statement to the JAIC is obvious: It dealt &#13;
    with up to 10-cm long cracks in the welding seams of the visor hinges observed &#13;
    by the student only some weeks before the casualty when he was the member &#13;
    of a working team. See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a> &#13;
    and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.177.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures &#13;
    12.5.177 - .179</a>. It was agreed that the man should identify the cracks &#13;
    at the hinge remains of the visor in Hangö and Enn Neidre took over the arrangements &#13;
    (apparently no one told him that the hinge remains had been cut off from the &#13;
    visor already in January and were now at the KTH in Stockholm). In any event &#13;
    the Swedish chairman, Olof Forssberg, wrote to the Estonian chairman, Andi &#13;
    Meister, on 20 March among other things:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"We agreed in Tallinn &#13;
      to question two witnesses about the observation of cracks ........ " </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Andi Meister replied on the &#13;
    following day, 27 March, among other things: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Referring to the Protocol &#13;
      of Interrogation which was discussed by the Commission on the last meeting &#13;
      ... Rudissaar, whom Oolmets claims he told about the matter, knows nothing &#13;
      about it or has only heard people talking about this matter. <b>There is &#13;
      a Mr. Gunnar Kull, who should know more</b>. Captain E. Neidre, member of &#13;
      the commission, shall arrange <b>the trip to Helsinki for Oolmets and Kull.</b> &#13;
      He will be in Helsinki with Oolmets and Kull in the morning of Friday 24th, &#13;
      and they will go to Hanko by car."</i></font></p>&#13;

    days tank conditions and cargo distribution - then known by the JAIC, but &#13;
    later proven to be incomplete - the Finnish videos made by ROVs in the early &#13;
    days, and some stability calculations and other documents were received. <br/>&#13;
          In a subsequent letter Börje Stenström wrote &#13;
    to Dr. Holtappels, the chairman of this 'Group of Experts' among other things:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I had the opportunity &#13;
      to see part of your instructions to the team members and noted with appreciation &#13;
      that they are instructed to work unbiased. I also feel that we were able &#13;
      to do so during our meeting. I do disagree, however, with your little indication &#13;
      that the international commission should not be unbiased. I would like you &#13;
      to rest assured that the commission has only three goals, to establish what &#13;
      hap-pened, why it happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. &#13;
      I am speaking for the Swedish part of the commission in this matter since &#13;
      we have a firm policy in this regard established by law. I take it that &#13;
      our policy will also be valid for the entire commission as we do, in reality, &#13;
      have the lead." </i><br/><b>Note:</b> The "little indication" that the JAIC might not be entirely &#13;
      unbiased refers, of course, to the Estonian JAIC members Andi Meister and &#13;
      Enn Neidre. The apparent fact that the Swedes had the "lead", although the &#13;
      Estonians had been awarded the chairmanship, reflects the factual situation. &#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The communication and exchange &#13;
    of documentation and information with JAIC, in particular with Stenström, &#13;
    went on and by fax of 28 March among other things the so-called "Explanatory &#13;
    Note" was received - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.172</a> - which was apparently meant to be the Estonian answer to the &#13;
    allegation of this 'Group of Experts' that the sensors of the Atlantic lock &#13;
    had been dismounted some time before the casualty. The note, however, merely &#13;
    states that the sensors on the ESTONIA were magnetic and not mechanical - &#13;
    as stated on the drawings - and that during the time under Estonian flag the &#13;
    sensors had not been changed, moreover that it was believed that these sensors &#13;
    had been installed at newbuilding already because there were numerous others &#13;
    of this type on other installations. In other words: the drawings of the yard &#13;
    were wrong. This was not the case as was subsequently established when previous &#13;
    Finnish electricians declared when and why they had changed the initial mechanical &#13;
    sensors against the magnetic ones. See Subchapter 3.3.6, pages 42/43 of the &#13;
    Final JAIC Report. <br/>&#13;
          By fax of 29 March Stenström sent among other &#13;
    things the Cargo Manifest by which he considered<i> "the truck loads to be &#13;
    properly documented and the truck loads to look quite harmless"</i>. It is &#13;
    revealed from the fax prints on top of the pages that it had been sent on &#13;
    27 September 1994 at 18.38 hours from Estline-Tallinn and that Stenström had &#13;
    received it on 29.11.94 from N&amp;T. See also <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    17.1.211</a> and <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 17.1</a>. &#13;
    The manifest contains 39 trucks of which the last one was added in handwriting &#13;
    although there were actually 40 onboard according to the Customs List - see &#13;
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.213.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    17.1.213</a>. This list had been in the hands of the Finnish police since &#13;
    14.10.94 already, however it is unknown when it was sent to Sweden. <br/>&#13;
         In any event, Stenström must have had in the early &#13;
    days some other manifest or list or information because by fax of 30.11.94 &#13;
    he informed SSPA (Ship Model Testing Facility) that there had been 34 trucks/trailers &#13;
    onboard only - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.3.462.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    38.3.462</a> and this went into the weight calculations for the first model &#13;
    tests in the tank to establish the wave load on the visor/and the locking &#13;
    devices. <br/>&#13;
         In this connection attention has also to be drawn &#13;
    to a further mistake made in this above-mentioned fax about weight distribution &#13;
    because Stenström wrote: <i>"tanks 13 + 14 (starboard and port heeling tanks) &#13;
    183 ts"</i>. He means though - according to his own statement during his first &#13;
    visit to Papenburg on 27 October 1994 - that the port heeling tank - no. 14 &#13;
    - had been completely filled with 183 ts., while the starboard tank had been &#13;
    left empty - see also <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters &#13;
    17.1</a> and <a href="29.5.htm" target="_blank">29.5</a>. In a stability and &#13;
    trim calculation received earlier, performed by Ship Consulting Oy, Turku &#13;
    on behalf of the Finnish JAIC and dated 01.12.94 - see Enclosure 38.3 - <b>both</b> &#13;
    heeling tanks are stated to have been filled completely with 185 ts each plus &#13;
    <b>34</b> trailers. <br/>&#13;
          By fax of 10 March Börje Stenström had already &#13;
    distributed his "Draft Technical Report", the forerunner to the Part-Report, &#13;
    among other things also to Dr. Holtappels. Already on the following day the &#13;
    conclusions - pointing, of course, to Papenburg - could be read in "DAGENS &#13;
    NYHETER" and the Berlin paper "TAZ". It revealed subsequently that the Sea &#13;
    Safety Director of Sjöfarts-verket, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, had given a copy &#13;
    to DAGENS NYHETER and the Estonian JAIC member Uno Laur had sold a copy to &#13;
    TAZ.<br/>&#13;
          On the same day Jutta Rabe from SPIEGEL TV &#13;
    interviewed Börje Stenström in his Stockholm office and after respective questions &#13;
    Stenström admitted to have personally thrown overboard the bolt of the Atlantic &#13;
    lock - see also the<a href="37.2.htm" target="_blank"> Subchapter 37.2.</a> &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
         In the course of the further interview he was asked &#13;
    whether they had examined the visor and the wreck for ice damage and his reply &#13;
    was:<i> "We had no indications for ice damage: it was a rather mild winter &#13;
    (he had been shown the ice charts only 3 weeks before) and there were no indications &#13;
    for such damage. At least, as far as we know</i>", and further:<i> "Anyway, &#13;
    I believe that possible ice damage has not been examined, however, I am not &#13;
    quite sure. A good question you are raising. We should possible check that."<br/>&#13;
         </i> In this context it has to be mentioned that &#13;
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' attended the hearings of several crew &#13;
    survivors as technical consultant of a German TV team and this was the first &#13;
    time that direct questions could be asked to key witnesses. One of the results &#13;
    was the drawing made by the survivor Henrik Sillaste about his observations &#13;
    on the monitor in the engine control room after the big heel. The drawing &#13;
    - see Enclosure 21.2.4 - shows the bow ramp in slightly open condition with &#13;
    water pressing through the gaps at both sides under pressure, however, more &#13;
    at starboard side. The drawing, confirmed by the other two survivors from &#13;
    the engine control room, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak - see <a href="21.2.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters &#13;
    21.2.3</a> and <a href="21.2.5.htm" target="_blank">21.2.5 </a>- proved that &#13;
    the bow ramp had still been closed or almost closed after the big heel, while &#13;
    according to the casualty scenario of the JAIC, the big heel was caused by &#13;
    huge water quantities having entered the car deck after the bow ramp had been &#13;
    pulled completely open by the forward tumbling visor. This was evidently wrong &#13;
    because the bow ramp was still been in the almost closed position when Sillaste &#13;
    and Kadak left the engine control room at a list of 30°/40°. From the very &#13;
    beginning of their testimonies Treu, Sillaste and Kadak have testified this &#13;
    water penetration at both sides of the bow ramp after the big heel. This was &#13;
    also reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and DAGENS NYHETER during the early days, &#13;
    however, unfortunately was ignored by the JAIC.<br/>&#13;
         Back to the "Draft Technical Report" of the JAIC &#13;
    which was analysed in detail by this 'Group of Experts'. After considerable &#13;
    discussions it was agreed not to comment on this draft report since it was &#13;
    out anyway and, in particular, since the JAIC was under no circumstances prepared &#13;
    to change its substance in preparation of the Part Report due to be published &#13;
    in early April. Instead Dr. Holtappels gave an interview to Lloyd's List which &#13;
    was published in the 17 March issue and reads as:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"German Yard inquiry &#13;
      finds lock system was altered MEYER WERFT HITS BACK ON 'ESTONIA' An investigation &#13;
      into the loss of the Baltic ferry 'Estonia' by the German yard which built &#13;
      her is set to counter Swedish press claims that a weak lock was responsible &#13;
      for the disaster. Meyer Werft, which is due to publish its first findings &#13;
      early next week, will claim that safety indicators had been tampered with &#13;
      and that the 'Estonia' was operating on a route where she would not have &#13;
      been. Lawyer and former shipowner Peter Holtappels, who heads the commission, &#13;
      said the findings would shed "a very different light" on the tragic accident &#13;
      than the impression given by parts of the report of the international commission &#13;
      published by the Swedish media. The preliminary German report claims that &#13;
      the safety indicators on the bridge showing whether the bow visor was locked &#13;
      had been tampered with to display permanent "green". It also alleges that &#13;
      the sensors on the major device, the Atlantic lock, had been removed. Dr. &#13;
      Holtappels declined to comment further on the claims but insisted that "the &#13;
      ship set sail from Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition" </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On 6 April the representatives &#13;
    of the relatives were informed in Stockholm by the Swedish JAIC about the &#13;
    contents and conclusions of the Part-Report, i.e. that the sequence-of-events &#13;
    which led to the capsizing and sinking of the ESTONIA had been initiated by &#13;
    the failure of the locking devices of the visor, in particular the Atlantic &#13;
    lock. Allegedly the locking system had been 50 per cent under-dimensioned. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
          Any questions concerning speed, behaviour of &#13;
    the crew, organisation of owners/managers were not answered with reference &#13;
    to the Final Report to be published by the end of the year. On the following &#13;
    day the Part-Report was introduced simultaneously in press conferences by &#13;
    the JAIC parts in Tallinn, Helsinki and Stockholm and copies were distributed &#13;
    to the media. In the introduction letter to the Part-Report Stenström states &#13;
    among other things: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The full report, covering &#13;
      also operational aspects and other outstanding matters is expected to be &#13;

      of the circumstances contributing to the accident. It has, however, been &#13;
      assumed to be of value to make the present findings available at an early &#13;
      stage to all sectors of the maritime world, working with various aspects &#13;
      of the safety of passengers ships."</i></font></p>&#13;

  </blockquote>&#13;
  <ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>" The bow visor locking &#13;

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The visor locking &#13;

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> Following failure &#13;

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The failure of the &#13;

  </ul><p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The previous hypothesis had &#13;
    become "conclusion" now and the JAIC made it quite clear in the Preface to &#13;
    the "Part-Report" that it was not their intention ever to change these "conclusions" &#13;
    when they stated:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The Commission has &#13;
      previously concluded that the accident was initiated by the locking devices &#13;
      for the bow visor being unable to withstand the loads imposed during the &#13;
      prevailing speed, heading and sea conditions. This conclusion is still valid. &#13;
      This part-report covers main technical findings and conclusions. The final &#13;
      report to be issued later will cover also all other factors and circumstances &#13;
      found to have contributed to the development of the accident. This will &#13;
      include inter alia operational practices, certification and inspections, &#13;
      stability information, weather conditions and train-ing. Rescue operations &#13;
      and resources will be covered as well." </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In other words, whatever &#13;
    the investigation ahead, for example of "<i>operational practices</i>" and &#13;
    "<i>inspections</i>", might reveal "<i>it is anticipated that all facts and &#13;
    conclusions reported herein (the visor locking devices were calculated with &#13;
    less strength than required according to calculations) remain unchanged in &#13;
    substance</i>". "<i>Operational practices</i>" for example includes the forcing &#13;
    of ice barriers several meters high at sea with full speed and the respective &#13;
    affect on the locking devices, the hinges and the visor structure in general, &#13;
    just to mention one example. For more examples see <a href="12.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters &#13;
    12.4</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br/>&#13;
          And Stenström continued with considerable energy &#13;
    to distribute his "present findings" - the term in itself implies that the &#13;
    findings are not final - to the maritime world by giving papers, for example &#13;
    at the IMO meeting on 31.10.94 and at the Marine Safety Seminar of the Cologne &#13;
    Re in Rotterdam - in 1995 - when he submitted his "present" findings as firmly &#13;
    established facts. He said in Rotterdam under the heading:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>MS Estonia</b> &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      1. Aspects of Human Shortcomings <br/>&#13;
      Sorting out the various contributory factors, it is obvious that the structural &#13;
      strength of the bow visor, the sea conditions and the speed of the vessel &#13;
      all contributed, and any one of these factors could be seen as triggering &#13;
      the catastrophe or could have prevented it. In the prevailing sea conditions &#13;
      two basic factors remain: The design of the locking device of the bow visor &#13;
      was too weak, and the speed of the vessel was too high under the prevailing &#13;
      conditions. The systems' inadequacies may be divided into three groups: &#13;
      Technical inadequacies, regulatory inadequacies and operational inadequacies.<br/>&#13;
      2. Technical inadequacies<br/>&#13;
      On the technical side, the classification rules valid at the time, and in &#13;
      particular those according to which the ship was built, were not very detailed &#13;
      and did not contain sufficient guidance for the design of the visor attachment &#13;
      devices. The shipyard designer did the best he could with the advice available &#13;
      and the result of his work would have been reasonably acceptable, albeit &#13;
      at the lower end of the scale. The manufacturing side of the shipyard, however, &#13;
      acted on quite different and unqualified information and built locking arrangements &#13;
      for the visor which had less than half the strength of the outcome of the &#13;
      calculation work. The visor attachment arrangements therefore had a total &#13;
      strength to failure of about one third to one half of what it should have &#13;
      had based on the knowledge of the sea loads at the time. The locking devices &#13;
      then failed under conditions equivalent to the assumed design load conditions. &#13;
      Such loads existed as extreme values under the prevailing speed and sea &#13;
      conditions. If the shipyard had had a quality assurance system similar to &#13;
      the current requirements under ISO 9000 there would have been routine procedures &#13;
      ensuring that the manufacturing was carried out on the basis of correct &#13;
      information." </i> </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Regardless of all this the &#13;
    exchange of information, the communication between this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    and the JAIC, especially Stenström, continued and was even deepened during &#13;
    the coming months after Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister had become a consultant to this &#13;
    'Group of Experts' in metallurgical matters. <br/>&#13;
          The main reason for the engagement of Prof. &#13;
    Dr. Hoffmeister of the University of the Armed Forces in Hamburg was the obvious &#13;
    attitude of the JAIC to state that the fractures of the locking devices and &#13;
    hinges had been caused in the overload mode while even the layman could see &#13;
    fatigue cracks at different vital places. Another reason was that the visor &#13;
    had to be examined in detail by a qualified metallurgist. In the course of &#13;
    the following weeks Prof. Hoffmeister closely inspected the visor and the &#13;
    parts already cut off and recovered from the wreck. After some time a relatively &#13;
    close co-operation developed with Prof. Kjell Pettersson from KTH, Stockholm, &#13;
    who had performed the metallurgical examination on behalf of the JAIC. The &#13;
    results of the investigations by Prof. Hoffmeister were laid down in draft &#13;
    reports nos. 1 to 4. Draft report no. 4 is still valid, because Prof. Hoffmeister &#13;
    is still expecting parts from the wreck for examination which would enable &#13;
    him to make final conclusions. <br/><b>Note</b>: The owners have repeatedly refused to let Prof. Hoffmeister have &#13;
    the parts in their possession for his examination. Simultaneously the exchange &#13;
    of views and information with Börje Stenström continued more or less uninterrupted. &#13;
    On 21 April there was a further meeting between Stenström and a member of &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' when a complete set of photos made of the visor and &#13;
    the foundations of both visor actuators were handed over to Stenström with &#13;
    interpretation. Stenström's attention was drawn to the accumulation of oil &#13;
    in the forepart of the 3rd stringer indicating that either the vessel must &#13;
    have had a forward trim more or less all the time and/or the visor had been &#13;
    misaligned in relation to the vessel possibly due to a pressed in stempost. &#13;
    Furthermore Stenström's attention was drawn to the fact that the port visor &#13;
    actuator was no more connected to the B-deck at the time of the casualty. &#13;
    He was only mildly interested, but told the story of the Landvetter meeting &#13;
    instead:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"All the main witnesses &#13;
      were questioned again - especially watch A.B. Silver Linde - however, in &#13;
      the presence of Enn Neidre, the superior of all ESCO sailors, which was &#13;
      regrettable but unavoidable because Neidre insisted and he was a JAIC member. &#13;
      The main aim of this meeting had been to find out what had happened on the &#13;
      bridge, why they had been so passive. According to Silver Linde the 2nd &#13;
      and 3rd officers had left the bridge after 01.00-01.05 hours, thus at that &#13;
      time they considered everything to be normal and routine. About 5 or 10 &#13;
      minutes later the vessel suddenly took a starboard list of about 20° and &#13;
      started a sharp port turn which increased the starboard heel. It seemed &#13;
      possible that the 2nd and 4th, mates, then on the bridge, were knocked off &#13;
      their feet and became unconscious. Then probably the (other) 2nd mate and &#13;
      the 3rd mate returned to the bridge, transmitted "Mayday" and "Mr. Skylight &#13;
      to No. 1 &amp; 2" and asked the engine room whether it was possible to pump &#13;
      over water to the high side. Survivors have confirmed that the lee side &#13;
      was the high side. A port turn has also been confirmed by the position of &#13;
      lost objects found on the sea bottom. Silver Linde had stated that when &#13;
      he was ordered to check the ramp to take the boatswain with him. The passenger &#13;
      who heard the hydraulic sound was midships on 4th deck - they believe he &#13;
      heard the stabilisers. There are no indications that they used the hydraulic &#13;
      actuators to hold down the visor."</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> So much for the Landvetter &#13;
    meeting. See also Subchapters <a href="21.2.2.htm" target="_blank">21.2.2</a>, &#13;
    <a href="21.2.3.htm" target="_blank">21.2.3</a>, <a href="21.2.5.htm" target="_blank">21.2.5</a>. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
          Furthermore, the Part-Report was discussed &#13;
    and Stenström's attention was drawn to the many mistakes, e.g. the <i>"disappeared &#13;
    stempost"</i> and the impossibility that the control lights were all green &#13;
    if the port lower bolt of the bow ramp had not engaged the pocket, etc. Finally &#13;
    Stenström was asked, why did they state in the Part-Report that <i>"in all &#13;
    probability the sequence of events and cause consideration will not be changed"</i> &#13;
    because evidently they had not even covered 10% of the required investigation &#13;
    extent. After some thinking, Stenström said: <i>"These are our instructions &#13;
    and please don't ask us any more questions in this respect. We had to draft &#13;
    our report to the effect that the blame is more or less entirely resting with &#13;
    Meyer Werft, however, in the Final Report we shall draft it so vaguely that &#13;
    there will be not enough evidence to commence legal action against the yard, &#13;
    in other words, after our Final Report has come out, nobody can be blamed &#13;
    and the case will be closed shortly afterwards"</i>. <br/>&#13;
          In the course of the following weeks and the &#13;
    ongoing exchange of views and information Stenström admitted that his Part-Report &#13;
    was wrong in some respects, however, when it came to water in the visor, which &#13;
    evidently had been there, he was not prepared to give in. After this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' had written, on 16 June:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"As to water in the &#13;
      visor which was flowing out once the vessel had reduced speed and the bow-wave &#13;
      became smaller we do not mean the crewmen of the pilot boat, but some Stockholm &#13;
      pilots who have observed the above, and they are not talking about just &#13;
      150 litres. On the other hand the fact that at sea the inside of the visor &#13;
      was filled up to outside level with water due to poor or missing rubberseals &#13;
      was admitted by Ulf Hobro at our discussion in your presence mid February."</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Stenström replied already &#13;
    on 22 June:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I think there is nobody &#13;
      claiming that the space inside the visor was dry. It is not even required &#13;
      to be watertight by their rules. In a seaway water will be pushed in through &#13;
      any leaking seals at a higher rate than it would flow out when the bow rises &#13;
      out of the water and some water may have been there in bad weather. Please &#13;
      consider, how-ever, that the ramp seals were probably not 100 per cent watertight &#13;
      either, in particular not at the lower edge due to some play in the hinges &#13;
      and the fact that one locking wedge had not found its way fully into its &#13;
      female part. Any steady level of water inside the visor should therefore &#13;
      undoubtedly leak past the ramp into the car deck area. The area was inspected &#13;
      regularly, even shortly before the accident, and there was no water in the &#13;
      ramp area. Have therefore difficulties in believing in the existence of &#13;
      any large amount of water in the visor that could have influenced the dynamics &#13;
      of the visor in a seaway."</i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Of course Stenström could &#13;
    under no circumstances accept large quantities of water inside the visor because &#13;
    at that time he knew already of the partly open bow ramp at the port lower &#13;
    corner which meant water on the car deck which evidently had been the case &#13;
    already in 1993 - see <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 12.4.4</a>, &#13;
    especially the statement of pilot Bo Söderman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.4.4.161</a>. <br/>&#13;
          Also another principle matter was seen differently &#13;
    by Stenström and this 'Group of Experts', viz. the non-recorded respectively &#13;
    non-documented repairs. </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>4. Visor Structure &#13;
      </b><br/>&#13;
      You might have good control about the documented repairs ,but what abut &#13;
      the ones not documented? Who has and when carried out the highly insufficient &#13;
      repairs to lower lugs at B-Deck of the port actuator (hydraulic cylinder), &#13;
      just to mention one example? These repairs as well as changing of bushings &#13;
      of the visor hinges e.g. are subject to class inspection and repair approval, &#13;
      which, as you know, has not been the case." </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström replied:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"It is quite possible, &#13;
      and normal onboard any ship, that small defects are repaired onboard, e.g. &#13;
      the crack in the stiffener underneath the port side platform for the lifting &#13;
      actuator. Replacing a hinge bushing is a different things, that would be &#13;
      a considerable undertaking even at a shipyard and can certainly not be undertaken &#13;
      whilst in service. There are no indications in all the records we have examined &#13;
      of such a repair, superintendents and other people who have followed the &#13;
      ship also deny that any such work should have been carried out. Why should &#13;
      it have been done secretly if there had been a need??? In case there had &#13;
      been a need to remove the bushing, burning off the old weld would undoubtedly &#13;
      have resulted in burning marks in tangential direction on the plating around &#13;
      the weld. There are no such marks. The cutting marks in the holes are perfectly &#13;
      perpen-dicular to the plate and cannot be generated by burning on an existing &#13;
      completed installation. Had there been a need for repair due to play, the &#13;
      old bronze bushing would undoubtedly have been removed by local machining. &#13;
      This is shipyard standard practice for relining any worn shaft bushing from &#13;
      propeller shaft bearings down to small diameters. As all four visor arm &#13;
      side plates have identical appearance, would you suggest that all four bushings &#13;
      were replaced by the crew in secrecy? The hinge bushing was inspected by &#13;
      Professor Hoffmeister last week and we had a few more sections cut and examined &#13;
      according to his desire. I hope he got the information he was looking for &#13;
      and will appreciate a copy of his report. The extra work has been done on &#13;
      behalf of the SHK as it is in our interest as well to find maximum amount &#13;
      of facts." </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström made it quite clear &#13;
    that the JAIC was of the definite opinion that the deep burning marks were &#13;
    caused by the yard already at newbuilding and did not hesitate to tell that &#13;
    also to the media. He was, however, wrong in almost all respects, because:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - at the starboard hinges &#13;
    were indications of tangential burning marks although covered by the welding &#13;

    - the perpendicular burning marks can very well be generated by burning on &#13;
    an existing completed installation as it was proved by a respective test carried &#13;
    out by Meyer Werft in summer 1995 - see the photo below and see also <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter &#13;

    arm plate looks identical to the test burnt installation part - see the photo &#13;
    above - and the port one is smooth without burning marks at all. A detailed &#13;
    inspection even revealed indications of circumferential drilling marks as &#13;
    initially the holes were drilled at newbuilding - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    2.4.6</a>. Therefore this 'Group of Experts' has always taken and still does &#13;
    take the view that the port bushings were still original while the starboard &#13;
    ones were very unprofessionally replaced. How gross negligently this replacement &#13;
    was carried out became fully clear when a passenger video was made available &#13;
    to this 'Group of Experts' in 1996 - see Subchapter 39.2. </font></p>&#13;

    The August Meeting </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The investigations went on &#13;
    and after some time it was felt that another meeting with the JAIC should &#13;
    be held, preferably in Hamburg, however due to the health problems of Börje &#13;
    Stenström it was agreed to have it in Stockholm when among other things also &#13;
    Prof. Hoffmeister would present his findings. <br/>&#13;
    The date was set for the 3 August and the following persons attended:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> for Sweden:                                        Börje &#13;
    Stenström - member <br/>&#13;

    Dipl. Ing. Tomas Wilkendorf Captain Werner Hummel </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This 'Group of Experts' presented &#13;
    their findings and the sequence-of-events supported by the metallurgical evaluations &#13;
    of Prof. Hoffmeister, all of which was discussed at the end.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The JAIC admitted that &#13;
    the visor was already substantially damaged when the vessel departed from &#13;
    Tallinn.<br/>&#13;
    - The JAIC admitted that the visor hinges were considerably weakened by fatigue.<br/>&#13;
    - The JAIC admitted that the existing poor condition of the hinges and locking &#13;
    devices does not necessarily result from bad performance of the new-building &#13;
    yard if no repair work was found to be documented or otherwise recorded. <br/>&#13;
    - It was agreed that Prof. Hoffmeister should make further detailed examinations &#13;
    of the hinges and Atlantic lock parts in close cooperation with KTH Stockholm &#13;
    and VTT Helsinki. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Finally, Dr. Holtappels indicated &#13;
    that the JAIC had to be considered biased due to the presence of the head &#13;
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO in the Commission, because ESCO having &#13;
    been 50% owner and crew manager of the ESTONIA was one of the subjects of &#13;
    the ongoing investigation. This was received by the audience in silence.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In summary it could be concluded &#13;
    that the JAIC got the message that their scenario was not necessarily the &#13;
    only one and that other circumstances had played a dominant role in the sinking &#13;
    of the ESTONIA and, further, that this 'Group of Experts' was not prepared &#13;
    to accept that the "scenario and main findings" of the Part-Report would remain &#13;
    "unchanged in substance". In those days this 'Group of Experts' still believed &#13;
    that the JAIC - being a governmental institution - wanted to find out the &#13;
    truth, maybe apart from the Estonians, however, the first shadows of doubt &#13;
    arose in particular created by the behaviour of Börje Stenström. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was the year of change &#13;
    when this 'Group of Experts' had to realize that the JAIC was not really trying &#13;
    to find the truth but was fighting for a particular truth as already stated &#13;
    before. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>39.1<br/>&#13;
    Communication and Investigation up to March 1996</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In January some time was &#13;
    spent drafting the reply to Börje Stenström's letter of 22.12.95 which - finally &#13;
    - was agreed and sent by fax of 22.01.96 to Sweden. As the contents is of &#13;
    some importance the questions with answers shall be quoted below:<br/>&#13;
    1. On top of pages 4 and 6 you say that von Tell submitted and B.V. approved &#13;
    load calculations for the locking devices. The only document we know about &#13;
    is the short telex from von Tell to B.V. informing that they had used LR rules &#13;
    for defining the strength of the locking devices and were somewhat high on &#13;
    shear stress (must presumably refer to the locking bolt). Have you seen any &#13;
    calculations?"<br/>&#13;
    as to 1:<br/>&#13;
    We have seen part of the telex exchange between von Tell-Hamburg and Gothenburg &#13;
    and also have seen some of their memos. From both it is revealed that there &#13;
    have been discussions (probably by telephone) between BV-Hamburg and von Tell-Gothenburg, &#13;
    and it has to be concluded that von Tell-Gothenburg have made calculations. &#13;
    This is also confirmed by the telex you have quoted and which is in your possession. &#13;
    To answer your question, we have not seen any of the von Tell calculations &#13;
    as we do not know where the files from von Tell-Gothenburg are, if they should &#13;
    still exist. We do conclude, however, from what we have read and heard from &#13;
    von Tell-Hamburg that such calculations have been made."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">2. On page 6 you further &#13;
    say that von Tell produced drawings sent to the yard for production. The von &#13;
    Tell drawings showed the von Tell deliveries and the complete assembly but &#13;
    not installation arrangements. Agree that the parts indicated by von Tell &#13;
    as "Werft Lieferung" are not clearly identified as information or as manufacturing &#13;
    guidance and we say in our text that this may have been misleading."<br/></font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 2: <br/>&#13;
    The parts marked "Werft Lieferung" in the von Tell drawings are generally &#13;
    according to scale respectively oversized in case they had to be made to fit &#13;
    for installation onboard. These parts are always drawn in such a way respectively &#13;
    the dimensions are stated in such detail that burning diagrams for the 1:10 &#13;
    shop could easily be made and/or the detail drawings were directly used for &#13;
    production. When questioning the yard workers having done the above-mentioned &#13;
    work in 1980 there was not the slightest indication that this "may have been &#13;
    misleading" - as you say in your report." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">3. On bottom of page 6 you &#13;
    say that the yard compared the von Tell design requirements with own results. &#13;
    Again, where are von Tell design requirements given?"<br/>&#13;
    "as to 3: <br/>&#13;
    When we say von Tell design requirements then we mean dimensions and form &#13;
    of the von Tell parts as could be taken from the drawings respectively from &#13;
    the information on the drawings supplied by von Tell. In other words, the &#13;
    yard obtained the load requirements which von Tell had based their dimensioning &#13;
    of the locking devices on by drawing conclusion from these dimensions and &#13;
    comparing the results with own calculations. In addition, this matter was &#13;
    certainly also discussed on the telephone, possibly personally."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">4. Page 7, item a), refers &#13;
    to welding tables instead of drawing information. The steel drawing for the &#13;
    visor does indeed contain very detailed welding information for welds which &#13;
    may be regarded as standard, such as butt joints between plates of different &#13;
    thickness. It is lacking, however, details of the non-standard welds, such &#13;
    as welding 60 mm thick plating. This seems to be contrary to your explanation." &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    as to 4:<br/>&#13;
    The steel drawing does contain some welding information and we agree to your &#13;
    statement that butt joints between 2 plates of different thickness have to &#13;
    be regarded as standard. This, however, does not refer to shape of the respective &#13;
    steel plate edges. It is for this reason that at the lower right corner of &#13;
    drawing 1103 very detailed dimension sketches can be found. The same refers &#13;
    to other dimension sketches on other parts of this drawing. We assume that &#13;
    your missing welding information is for the 60 mm plate. This can be found &#13;
    in way of the visor arms (butt joints) as well as on the very detailed sketch &#13;
    of the welds of the cylinder lifting lugs. In both cases, however, the measurement &#13;
    information does not refer to the thickness of the welding seams but to the &#13;
    preparation for the welding seams. The thickness of the welds is only indicated &#13;
    by the thick-black coloured area. For comparison please look at the detail &#13;
    "visor arm/bushing", where you will not find any measurement. Consequently &#13;
    no welding preparation was required because a fillet weld was planned. The &#13;
    black-coloured area, however, indicates a rather thick weld and reference &#13;
    is made in this respect to page 8c, i.e. the thickness of the weld should &#13;
    be between 50% and 70% of the thickness of the structural member to be welded. &#13;
    Due to the very clearly and easily recognisable black-coloured area the welders &#13;
    could not understand why they should not have followed instructions." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">5. Page 8, item (b). the &#13;
    lugs of the bottom lock show clearly that the holes for the bushings were &#13;
    made by machine flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges show at several places &#13;
    a machine flame cutting pattern. (The coarse flame cutting pattern still being &#13;
    a question-mark.)" <br/>&#13;
    as to 5: <br/>&#13;
    We have to assume that the lugs for the bottom locks including the holes in &#13;
    the lugs for the bushings had been made by the 1:10 shop by means of machine &#13;
    flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges, however, have been definitely drilled. &#13;
    This is confirmed by the evidence of those who have done it in 1980, the respective &#13;
    drawings, photos and, last but not least, the remains of the hinges at KTH. &#13;
    In particular, the outer port hinge - showing only very minor burning marks &#13;
    at one location - demonstrates the original condition of the hinges at time &#13;
    of delivery, whilst at the stb. hinges due to the severe burning marks 10-15 &#13;
    mm material is missing. This is contrary to your previous statement when you &#13;
    said that the initial thickness would be still there.<br/>&#13;
    In summary we agree that the holes in the lugs for the bushings of the Atlantic &#13;
    lock have probably been machine flame cut, although we have not yet found &#13;
    the respective drawing for the 1:10 shop (probably due to the use of "Diana &#13;
    II" drawings). As far as the holes for the hinge bushings are concerned, however, &#13;
    we emphasize that these were drilled, which we are able to prove and have &#13;
    done so already. We strongly suggest that you re-measure the hinge remains &#13;
    at KTH again and you will find out that at the stb. hinges there is 10-15 &#13;
    mm material less than at the port hinges. That leads to the conclusion that &#13;
    at the stb. hinges at least 10 mm material was missing (taken away by the &#13;
    burning) which at port side is still there. What effect that had on the alignment &#13;
    of the visor you may conclude yourself." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">6. Page 9, first para. We &#13;
    have not seen any von Tell drawings giving welding information to the yard." &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    as to 6:<br/>&#13;
    The respective drawing will follow shortly." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">7. Page 11, last para. We &#13;
    understand that Viking Sally was on the contrary a few hundred tons lighter &#13;
    than originally estimated."<br/>&#13;
    as to 7: <br/>&#13;
    "Viking Sally" was not a few hundred tons lighter than originally estimated, &#13;
    but during the building phase the steel weight was continuously controlled &#13;
    very carefully in order to avoid overweight which would reduce the deadweight &#13;
    figure. As a matter of fact, AB Sally commenced arbitration proceedings against &#13;
    Meyer Werft claiming that the vessel was too heavy and thus could not carry &#13;
    the contracted deadweight, which, however, was not found by the arbitrators.<br/>&#13;
    All this has nothing to do with the welding seams which, in total, correspond &#13;
    only to max. 2% of the steel weight. <br/>&#13;
    Your assumption is probably based on the well known fact that Meyer Werft &#13;
    vessels have proved to be heavier and stronger than ordered for decades."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 8. Page 12, 4th para. We &#13;
    have no documentation showing that the bottom lock was installed to meet a &#13;
    design load of 132 tons. If available, please provide. Bottom of the same &#13;
    page, the safety factor is not so easily defined in a design where base material &#13;
    and welds carry the load simultaneously because the welds have some much lower &#13;
    ductility once the yielding strength is exceeded." <br/></font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 8: <br/>&#13;
    The 132 ts figure is based on 7.5 mm welds and on a permissible tension of &#13;
    150 N/mm². (7.5 mm welds were initially applied.) The safety factor considered &#13;
    can be defined as the proportion between the nominal tension and the tension &#13;
    of the breaking tension of the basis material."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">9. Page 13, bottom. Was the &#13;
    extract from the von Tell drawing with the length of the side lug S70 released &#13;
    by the yard for production? If so, based on which calculations? As far as &#13;
    we can calculate, the strength of the side lug installation was somewhere &#13;
    around 100 tons when subjected to the combined pulling and bending force. &#13;
    This matches the actual tests carried out in Helsinki." <br/>&#13;
    as to 9: <br/>&#13;
    The lugs of the side locks were made according to von Tell drawing. The yard &#13;
    has made sure that the length was sufficient. The relatively low LCC of the &#13;
    side locks is not due to the too short lugs but due to the wrongly placed &#13;
    stiffeners at the bulkheads behind the lugs."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">10. Page 15, mid. The "Copenhagen &#13;
    Convention" you are referring to certainly does not put any obligations on &#13;
    classification societies but contains an agreement between the Nordic countries &#13;
    that classification societies may be authorised to perform certain functions &#13;
    under the jurisdiction of one country and agreement that such authorization &#13;
    will then be accepted also by the other administrations." <br/>&#13;
    as to 10: <br/>&#13;
    Name and application of this convention was given to us by the Finnish Board &#13;
    of Navigation as an explanation why they did not become active in SOLAS matters &#13;
    concerning vessel's structure."</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">11. Further observations. &#13;
    I have looked back on ROV videos and have seen views of the bottom lock sensor &#13;
    mounting plate where the smaller holes for the magnetic sensors are clearly &#13;
    visible. Still no signs of the sensors themselves."<br/>&#13;
    as to 11:<br/>&#13;
    - We have also had more closer looks at the mounting plate in question and &#13;
    still did not find any sign of sensors, which, according to a member of the &#13;
    relief crew had been removed already several months before (due to damage &#13;
    sustained during the ice-winter 1994). In our opinion it is also clear from &#13;
    the videos that the cables for the sensors have been cut. <br/>&#13;
    - The condition of the rubber packings we have discussed so many times and &#13;
    we have nothing to add to this. <br/>&#13;
    - The visor was not flooded during sea trials (there were 4 people present, &#13;
    among them the BV surveyor Lohmann and the von Tell representative Todsen). &#13;
    At 22 kn speed and vessel pitching in head sea near Helgoland some water was &#13;
    leaking through the packing. After return to Emden they carried out the chalk-test &#13;
    and found that the packing at one location was not fitting tightly enough; &#13;
    a flat bar was welded in way, the packing fitted again, a high pressure hose &#13;
    test was carried out, and the visor was accepted as being weathertight by &#13;
    owners, BV, Yard and von Tell. (Signed acceptance or delivery certificate &#13;
    has been sent to you.)"</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "Have also seen plenty of &#13;
    rubber packing on the forepeak deck in various state of separation from the &#13;
    flat bars. Understand the visor was flooded already during the sea trials. &#13;
    Do you have any information about how this was corrected." <br/>&#13;
    "General:<br/>&#13;
    You will recall that the quantity of water at sea inside the visor respectively &#13;
    the height of the water level has always been in dispute between us. Although &#13;
    there are very clear water marks inside visor and outside the (closed) ramp &#13;
    you would not accept this, which we could never understand until you gave &#13;
    us the explanation for your attitude. Your explanation was the gap at the &#13;
    lower port side in way of the securing bolt (which did or could not engage &#13;
    the mating pocket at the ramp side), i.e. there was a small opening of the &#13;
    bow ramp through which water would have penetrated the cardeck much earlier &#13;
    already with serious consequences, which it obviously did not do and therefore &#13;
    the water could not have been as high in the visor as we say. Upon my question &#13;
    where do you know this from, your answer was that the gap was caused by the &#13;
    severely twisted port outer hinges of the bow ramp, which had been stated &#13;
    in the working list several times for repairs but had not been repaired because &#13;
    it is a major item. We have thereafter looked a bit deeper into this and can &#13;
    see on the videos that the hinge was under repair. We have also found the &#13;
    explanation for water in the visor up to the visible marks, i.e. above the &#13;
    gap, and still no water on cardeck (at least not in dangerous quantities, &#13;
    i.e. crew members have plugged the gap each time bow ramp/visor were closed &#13;
    when they had to go down anyway to hammer the bolt of the Atlantic lock closed &#13;
    and at the same time plugged clothing, sheets, rags and the like into the &#13;
    bow ramp gap. You can still see these rags, etc. hanging respectively being &#13;
    pressed in way of the initial gap." The complete letter is attached as Enclosure &#13;
    39.1.466 and its contents have never been disputed by the JAIC.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 8 January 58 pages of &#13;
    the index from the Swedish JAIC's register were received and carefully studied. &#13;
    The non-classified documents of interest, in particular the statements of &#13;
    the survivors, were ordered and subsequently copied and sent to Hamburg by &#13;
    members of the SEA relatives organisation. The statements and other documents &#13;
    arrived in bunches in the course of February and March and were very carefully &#13;
    studied, which took some time since they were in Swedish. Reference will be &#13;
    made to this further turning point in the investigation under the respective &#13;
    month. On the same day the Swedish JAIC plus the Sjöfartsverket observer Sten &#13;
    Andersson met again with S.C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&amp;T who were accompanied &#13;
    by their lawyer. No details of the meeting are known. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">February: In an internal &#13;
    meeting of this 'Group of Experts' it was decided to build a mock-up of the &#13;
    Atlantic lock with as-found welding seams, i.e. 3 mm, and have it pulled to &#13;
    destruction. The JAIC was informed accordingly and it was offered to have &#13;
    the break test performed by VTT or any other institute in the choice of the &#13;
    JAIC. After some time Klaus Rahka - the Finnish metallurgist expert - came &#13;
    back on behalf of the JAIC and declared that the JAIC was happy with the "Institute &#13;
    for Shipbuilding" (Institut für Schiffbau) of the University Hamburg to perform &#13;
    the break test, but that the JAIC would like to attend. The preparations for &#13;
    the tests, to which Klaus Rahka submitted own proposals, commenced and took &#13;
    several weeks. The JAIC Report was now scheduled to be published on 15.06.96. &#13;
    At the same time this 'Group of Experts' started the publication of a request &#13;
    to the Swedish people in the Swedish Text-TV for photos, slides, videos and &#13;
    other documentation/information about the condition and performance of the &#13;
    ESTONIA during her 20 months in service under this name. The request was repeated &#13;
    daily for 6 months and led to several slides, photos and videos, among them &#13;
    the so-called "passenger video" of 19.09.94 which shall be commented under &#13;
    "April" when it was received. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">March: One of the highlights &#13;
    of the month was the publication of the book "Katastrofenkurs" (Catastrophe &#13;
    Course) by Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle. Hellberg was working as journalist &#13;
    for DAGENS NYHETER and had proven on several occasions to have had confidential &#13;
    access to the classified files of the Swedish part of the JAIC while Anders &#13;
    Jörle was then working in the Stockholm office of "GÖTEBORG POSTEN" <br/>&#13;
    The conclusion of the book written after more than one year of investigation &#13;
    was: <br/>&#13;
    The sinking of the 'Estonia' had been caused by the failure of the visor hinges &#13;
    which were considerably pre-damaged by faulty and unqualified performed repairs. &#13;
    The catastrophe was programmed and could have had occurred practically at &#13;
    any time. Contributing factors were the facts that the master had not been &#13;
    on the bridge during the decisive last 15-20 minutes and further that the &#13;
    vessel departed from Tallinn with full port ballast water tanks but still &#13;
    had a starboard list. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was, more or less, a &#13;
    confirmation of the tentative casualty scenario and cause consideration of &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' and in complete contradiction to the JAIC. Stenström &#13;
    said that he would not read the book, but his colleagues had done so. </font></p>&#13;

    The Break Tests and the FE Analysis of the Visor </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The first break test of a &#13;
    mock-up of the Atlantic lock with 3-mm welds (as-found) between bushings and &#13;
    lugs was carried out by the Institute for Shipbuilding of the University Hamburg &#13;
    in the presence of Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish JAIC. <br/>&#13;
    The result was the breaking of the big visor lug at a load of about 210 ts, &#13;
    a result which was in total contradiction to the calculations and findings &#13;
    of the JAIC and hectic phone calls between Karppinen/Rahka and Stenström followed. &#13;
    For details of this and the break tests performed subsequently reference is &#13;
    made to Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> 34.3 </a>and <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">34.4.</a> &#13;
    The result of this first break test meant that the break load of an intact &#13;
    Atlantic lock installation on the forepeak deck would have been in excess &#13;
    of 210 ts. As the lugs on the forepeak deck failed at the accident whilst &#13;
    the visor lug held, it follows that the lugs on the forepeak deck of ESTONIA &#13;
    must have had a holding power inferior even to a new lock with only 3 mm welding &#13;
    seams.<br/>&#13;
    At this time the attention of the JAIC was also drawn to the results of an &#13;
    FE analysis of the visor and the loads on its locking devices which had been &#13;
    performed by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg - see Subchapter<a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    34.2</a>. The result of this scientific analysis was that as long as the visor &#13;
    hinges were intact the load on the Atlantic lock was only in the range of &#13;
    50-60 ts. - much less than on the side locks - and that the force direction &#13;
    was towards aft and upwards. Only after the visor hinges were broken the load &#13;
    on the Atlantic lock almost tripled and the force direction changed towards &#13;
    forward/upwards, i.e. the mode in which the lugs failed at the accident. All &#13;
    this was submitted in detail and in combination with the detailed break-test &#13;
    results to the JAIC, however without any obvious result. Upon request of the &#13;
    JAIC three further tests were prepared, i.e. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- with a strengthened visor &#13;
    lug to find out the break load of the 3 lugs with 3 mm welds;<br/>&#13;
    - with tag welds between lugs and bushings;<br/>&#13;
    - without welds between lugs and bushings; </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Klaus Rahka attended at one &#13;
    further test and he even made written proposals - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.2.466.1.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 39.2.466.</a>1 - the others were left to the "Institute for Shipbuilding". &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    In any event, it had been established that an intact Atlantic lock installa-tion &#13;
    with 3-mm welds only failed at a load of 210 ts, and that the visor lug made &#13;
    of mild steel was the weakest point. It was further established by the FE &#13;
    analysis of the visor performed by the TU-Harburg that the load on the Atlantic &#13;
    lock was comparatively small, less than 1/3 of the break load, and that the &#13;
    force direction was aft/upwards as long as the visor hinges were intact. Since &#13;
    the lugs on the forepeak deck, however, broke in a forward/upwards mode at &#13;
    a load below 210 ts, it has to be concluded<br/>&#13;
    (a) that the visor hinges were already broken when the Atlantic lock failed &#13;
    and, further,<br/>&#13;
    (b) that the Atlantic lock installation was no more intact, a fact that was &#13;
    confirmed by the investigation of Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister. See <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    34.8.</a></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> All this in combination &#13;
    with the side lock break-tests results by VTT, Helsinki, indicated very clearly &#13;
    that the intact, i.e. as built, locking devices of the visor had by far not &#13;
    been as weak as the JAIC had outlined in their Part-Report and this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts' could correctly demand from the JAIC to correct their load assumptions &#13;
    and conclusions. This, however, was not done in spite of all the contradictory &#13;
    evidence, which could not be better demonstrated than by the fax that the &#13;
    Swedish JAIC administrator Gunnel Göransson did send to the 'STERN' representative &#13;
    in Stockholm in April 1996. It reads - office translated - as follows:<br/><i>"I hope you received the DN article, Anders Hellberg, who wrote the article &#13;
    did follow up the commission work already from the beginning and did also &#13;
    write a book which has recently been published. </i></font></p>&#13;
  <p><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here are the answers to &#13;
    your questions: <br/>&#13;
    1. Why does the Commission disregard the rumours concerning sabotage, dumping &#13;
    of narcotics, the master involved with the Russian Mafia? The damage scenario &#13;
    is so clear. The Commission has examined the visor and knows that all the &#13;
    locking devices, Atlantic lock and side locks were properly closed when the &#13;
    visor broke off. Therefore the rumours that the visor shall have been opened &#13;
    early and that then the locking devices could not have been properly locked &#13;
    again, cannot be true. Furthermore, if they would have had indeed the intention &#13;
    to dump cargo overboard it would have been much more suitable to do it by &#13;
    the stern ramps. <br/>&#13;
    2. Did 'Estonia' comply with requirements for so-called 'short voyages'? The &#13;
    answer is yes. The law requires that if the vessel proceeds more than 20 nm &#13;
    from the nearest land, there has to be a radio operator onboard and there &#13;
    has to be provision in the lifeboats (food and water). 'Estonia' had this &#13;
    after she flew the Estonian flag and it was valid until the accident. Earlier &#13;
    when 'Estonia' traded between Stockholm and Turku she had an exemption. <br/>&#13;
    3. Cause of the casualty? <br/>&#13;
    The commission maintains its opinion as stated in the technical Part-Report, &#13;
    see page 31. a.)<br/>&#13;
    The locking devices of the visor were constructed with less strength than &#13;
    required according to calculations. Extraordinary heavy weather. The ramp &#13;
    enclosed by the visor construction, etc. The report shall be ready later summer &#13;
    or early autumn. Regards, Gunnel" </font></i></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Subsequently Olof Forssberg &#13;
    was interviewed by "DER STERN" and the resulting article with the heading &#13;
    "Unqualified Rubbish Talks" published in STERN Nr. 18/96 shall be quoted in &#13;
    parts:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "STERN : Witnesses did reportedly &#13;
    hear already shortly after 20.00 hours starting noises on the car deck ... &#13;
    . What explanation does the commission have?<br/>&#13;
    Forssberg : Of course all sorts of noises were heard. We have heard 135 witnesses &#13;
    (Note: actually they heard 5), however no one heard car noises or did see &#13;
    anything respectively. Furthermore the car deck was control-led by cameras &#13;
    and the pictures were transferred to monitors on the bridge and in the engine &#13;
    room .... . I do not understand that this is taken seriously in Germany.<br/>&#13;
    STERN : Is it true that certain witnesses' statements have never been properly &#13;
    followed up and that they are now classified? <br/>&#13;
    Forssberg : During the pending investigation not everything is public. However, &#13;
    when we present our Final Report all the statements will be put on the table. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    STERN : How did the casualty develop according to the Commission?<br/>&#13;
    Forssberg : ... The combination of weather, waves and speed explains why the &#13;
    visor was torn off. In addition, the construction of the vessel, the connection &#13;
    between visor and bow ramp was not very fortunate, and the locks were not &#13;
    strong enough to master the situation. <br/>&#13;
    STERN : Is it true that divers were allowed to examine every-thing on the &#13;
    sunken ferry except for the car deck? Is there something hidden? <br/>&#13;
    Forssberg : In order to be able to enter the car deck difficult burning work &#13;
    is necessary. There was no reason for this. It is irrelevant for our investigation &#13;
    whether there were drugs or cobalt onboard. <br/>&#13;
    STERN : Isn't it wrong to bury the 'Estonia' under concrete in the light of &#13;
    these speculations before possible new evidence has been secured? <br/>&#13;
    Forssberg : We have all the information we need. ..." </font></p>&#13;

    The STERN questions were answered and the interview was made well after the &#13;
    results of the break tests in Hamburg and Helsinki were known to Forssberg. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    It is also amazing to note that Forssberg states that the JAIC has all information &#13;
    they need while at the same time Stenström, Karppinen and Rahka are preparing &#13;
    a detailed ROV inspection of the vessel and Lethola even considered another &#13;
    wreck examination by Finnish divers. See Subchapter 39.5. </font></p>&#13;

    The Passenger Video </font></b></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 April a 90-second video &#13;
    was received which showed the closing of the visor looking down from the open &#13;
    deck 8. After the visor was closed the operator zoomed on the starboard visor &#13;
    hinge for quite a while and the result was shocking. The video showed very &#13;
    clearly and without doubt that the hinge was in an inoperable condition: The &#13;
    outer bushing stuck out, with its lower half missing and the securing plate &#13;
    was gone as well, just to mention a few of the very serious deficiencies demonstrated &#13;
    by this video. The video was taken by a Swedish passenger only 10 days before &#13;
    the last departure of the ESTONIA, i.e. on 17 September 1994. In order to &#13;
    secure this valuable evidence properly and to obtain the most reliable information &#13;
    from it the reconnaissance expert Bryan Roberts was instructed to evaluate &#13;
    the video tape by means of his acknowledged methods and summarize his findings &#13;
    in a report. For details see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    12.5</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    12.5.180</a>. Various images were made and one was sent by courier on 4 June &#13;
    to Börje Stenström together with the explanation of what this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    could see on the images/tape, i.e.: <br/>&#13;
    - there is a clear gap between the outer hinge plates vessel-/visor-sides &#13;
    which was obviously created by the steel bushing not sticking far enough through &#13;
    the bore, i.e. the larger part of the bushing is at the outer side of the &#13;
    visor hinge plate. - the outer securing plate is missing although 3 bolts &#13;
    can be seen.<br/>&#13;
    - the lower part at the outer part of the bushing is apparently missing because &#13;
    you can see the end of the visor arm respectively the deck where the bushing &#13;
    respectively the securing plate should be.<br/>&#13;
    - From the original of this photo, which is slightly clearer than the attached &#13;
    copy, you can also see that the hinge plates at vessel's side are not parallel &#13;
    to those from the visor.<br/>&#13;
    - Furthermore, at the inner side there is a rust spot where subsequently the &#13;
    upper fracture occurred. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström replied on &#13;
    16 June as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>"1. Starboard side hinge. &#13;
    Have double checked together with Mikael Huss and Hans Öberg that the free &#13;
    ends of the hinge beam side plates are parallel, not converging as the video &#13;
    picture shows. This may influence the virtual position of the hinge bushing. &#13;
    Will look forward to a computer enhanced picture when available." </i><br/>&#13;
    The Swedish JAIC showed the images sent to them to N&amp;T for comments. The result &#13;
    is unknown. <br/>&#13;
    In August, during a meeting in Hamburg with the representatives of the relatives' &#13;
    organisations DIS and SEA, Henning Witte and Lennart Berglund, the video tape &#13;
    was shown, without mentioning the date when it was made. After his return &#13;
    to Stockholm Witte informed the press which triggered off some interviews &#13;
    with JAIC members and N&amp;T on which SVENSKA DAGBLADET reported on 31 August &#13;
    as follows: <br/>&#13;
    "The video film was made by a Swedish passenger when 'Estonia' was in Tallinn &#13;
    harbour. Meyer Werft refuses to say by whom and on which date the film was &#13;
    made, but stated that it was "shortly before the casualty". <br/>&#13;
    The film shows quite clearly, believes Meyer Werft, that the port hinges of &#13;
    the bow visor had been manipulated. The yard's conclusion is that carrying &#13;
    parts welded together in order that the hinges function better will lead to &#13;
    weakening of the load carrying capacity. <br/>&#13;
    Shots from the video film are known to the International Commission for more &#13;
    than 1 month and they have received an offer to obtain a copy of the film. &#13;
    This shall be done shortly by the Finnish Commission members, said Olof Forssberg, &#13;
    Chairman of the Swedish part of the International Commission. He refused today &#13;
    to comment on the degree of importance of the picture material as evidence. &#13;
    This will, however, be determined before the substantially delayed Final Report &#13;
    will be published. .......... <br/>&#13;
    On behalf of the owners N&amp;T the technical manager, Sten-Christer Forsberg, &#13;
    rejected the last play-out of the German yard." <br/>&#13;
    "This is nothing new or changed, not everything is as obvious as it seems. &#13;
    We have seen the shots from the video which the yard has sent to the Commission &#13;
    and we have replied that these pictures do not prove what the Germans are &#13;
    alleging", said S.C. Forsberg.<br/>&#13;
    "The pictures are data enlargements and are of the same fantastic quality &#13;
    as the Germans are talking about their own behaviour. We base ourselves only &#13;
    on our own material which confirms that the vessel was 'in good condition' &#13;
    before the casualty", said S.C. Forsberg. <br/>&#13;
    He also rejected the conclusion of Meyer Werft viz. that there should be no &#13;
    welding at load carrying parts in order to make the hinges of the visor function &#13;
    better. <br/>&#13;
    "There have been no welding works at the visor hinges. This is furthermore &#13;
    another one in a line of allegations put forward by the Germans. Earlier they &#13;
    had already alleged that the bow visor was opened when the vessel was in Stockholm. &#13;
    But the visor is mainly not opened when the vessel is in Stockholm", said &#13;
    S.C. Forsberg, who characterised the acting of the German yard as "unethical".<br/>&#13;
    The remarks of the N&amp;T manager shall not be commented, however, the attention &#13;
    of the reader is drawn to the picture on page 292 of this report which shows &#13;
    the ESTONIA at her berth in Stockholm with open visor and open bow ramp.<br/>&#13;
    On 5 September a copy of the video tape together with the Bryan Roberts report &#13;
    was handed over to the Finnish part of the JAIC in Helsinki. It was viewed &#13;
    jointly with Kari Lethola, Tuomo Karppinen, Klaus Rahka and Kari Larjo and &#13;
    everybody realised and recognised the deficiencies as explained in the report &#13;
    of Bryan Roberts. Subsequently the tape was sent to the Criminal Police Laboratory &#13;
    for examination whether it had been falsified, which it was not. Thereafter &#13;
    a copy was sent to Olof Forssberg of the Swedish JAIC, who informed prosecutor &#13;
    Tomas Lindstrand about the video.<br/>&#13;
    By letter of 13 September, however, Forssberg sent the tape to the Military &#13;
    Intelligence Service (MUST) - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.467.htm" target="_blank">39.3.467 &#13;
    </a>- and asked for data processing and contour strengthenings of certain &#13;
    sequences. <br/>&#13;
    The MUST reply came on 20 September and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.468.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure &#13;
    39.3.468. </a><br/>&#13;
    The "comments on the picture sequence" by MUST reads as follows: <br/>&#13;
    "Mikael Huss mentioned a 'white line' at the bottom of the visor arm and the &#13;
    right part of the hinge. Upon studying the sequences picture by picture it &#13;
    is visible that this line is connected and sometimes looks broken. We have &#13;
    made 2 examples from each part picture which show these variations. <br/>&#13;
    Such effect might occur with pictures if the distance between 2 objects is &#13;
    just few frames. Sometimes the objects are melting together and sometimes &#13;
    there appears to be a gap between them. This is due to the digital sensor &#13;
    of the video camera, respectively, how this sensor meets the shadow in each &#13;
    single picture." <br/>&#13;
    The result is not negative and it is nowhere mentioned that the video tape &#13;
    is not reliable and cannot be interpreted correctly.<br/>&#13;
    Nevertheless Stenström wrote on 20 September to this 'Group of Experts':<br/><i>"Regarding the tourist video picture, we have of course studied the report &#13;
    of Dr. Robert with great interest. Unfortunately it does not come out from &#13;
    his report whether the analysis is based on a computer enhanced picture or &#13;
    purely from work with isolated pictures. Was a computer treated picture ever &#13;
    produced? We have looked at the video tape handed over to our Finnish colleagues &#13;
    two weeks ago and have done so on a screen where the pictures could be fed &#13;
    one by one with retained clarity. In this mode most of the details in the &#13;
    hinge area jump around quite a bit and the starboard hinge bushing is twisted &#13;
    clockwise almost as often as it is twisted anti-clockwise. We are attempting &#13;
    to get a computer processed picture from the copy we have and will study further &#13;
    the possibility of a pre-accident damage to the hinge arrangement."</i> <br/>&#13;
    On 28 September DAGENS NYHETER published under the heading "The Hinges of &#13;
    the Visor Were Sound" the comment of Olof Forssberg: "The pictures which allegedly &#13;
    show that the visor hinges were maltreated show instead that the hinges were &#13;
    'completely sound'." <br/>&#13;

    On 21 October Anders Hellberg wrote in DAGENS NYHETER under the heading "Video &#13;
    Film Causes Controversies" and quoted the following comments: <br/>&#13;
    "Olof Forssberg: <i>"We do not believe that the pictures show anything new, &#13;
    none of them reveal that there was such a damage as alleged by the relatives."</i><br/>&#13;
    Hellberg went on to say: <i>"Börje Stenström pointed out that the loads during &#13;
    the casualty night affected the port and not the starboard hinges as the yard &#13;
    is now alleging."</i><br/>&#13;
    Finally he quoted Sten-Christer Forsberg, the technical manager of N&amp;T, who &#13;
    could find nothing serious in the report of the English expert: <br/><i>"As far as I understand the judgements of the Swedish defence and the JAIC &#13;
    destroy the basis for the theory of the German yard." </i><br/>&#13;

    Börje Stenström wrote on 3 November to this 'Group of Experts':<br/><i>"Have arranged for a copy of the data processed picture of the deck hinge &#13;
    to be sent to you. This picture is produced by superimposing in a computer &#13;
    program all the still pictures during a time period. In the 'average' picture &#13;
    so obtained the distorsions, which are numerous in any one still picture from &#13;
    a video camera, will be eliminated.<br/>&#13;
    I am still not certain whether Dr. Robert has used such technique or not in &#13;
    his work. In this cleaned up picture we cannot see any signs of the distorsions &#13;
    that Dr. Roberts is reporting about. <br/>&#13;
    Am trying to look into the listing of discrepancies you made in the fax but &#13;
    have very little evidence to by. Likewise we have no evidence of any contact &#13;
    accident with a berth of breakwater, certainly nothing that has been reported &#13;
    to the class."</i><br/>&#13;
    The picture received showed the same as all the other images and the tape &#13;
    itself. It was nevertheless sent to Bryan Roberts for comments, which read &#13;
    as follows:<br/><i>"Thank you for your letter of the 12 November and the enclosed print 0:05:17. &#13;
    This is within the bracket of frames I used in my Report. The complete range &#13;
    showing the starboard hinge assembly being 0:05:13 to 0:05:40. These were &#13;
    all used to arrive at the conclusions in my Report. <br/>&#13;
    The frame 0:05:17 is one of this sequence and, with frame by frame re-examination &#13;
    I can see no reason to change the content of my Report in any way. The change &#13;
    of angle between the visor bolt (annotation 10) and the outer bushing (annotation &#13;
    8) can be clearly seen on images in this sequence and equally well on frame &#13;
    0:05:17, although the quality of the images I used were rather better than &#13;
    this print. <br/>&#13;
    In assembling my Report I examined all frames on the video tape with any possible &#13;
    relevance to damage or distortion. These were viewed frame by frame on a Sony &#13;
    UP5200 printer/projector which allows visual examination of each frame and &#13;
    printout of selected frames at a chosen degree of enlargement. The ability &#13;
    to scan a sequence allows the comparison of one frame to another and any difference &#13;
    between components of an assembly to be seen." </i><br/>&#13;
    Bryan Roberts' reply was sent to Stenström by fax of 15 November together &#13;
    with the following remarks:<br/><i>"Since you have given your photo together with the report of Bryan Roberts &#13;

    (copy attached), we will now also give the comments of Bryan Roberts to Anders &#13;
    Hellberg and others." </i><br/>&#13;
    Stenström's reply came two days later on 17 November: <br/><i>"To clarify matters, the picture of the starboard hinge first appeared &#13;
    on Swedish TV in an interview with the lawyer Witte, obviously after he had &#13;
    had a meeting with you. Media naturally demanded comments from the commission &#13;
    and only then did we make our opinion public.<br/>&#13;
    As to the technicalities, we have also looked at the pictures one by one and, &#13;
    as I have said before, there is considerable jumping around of the contours &#13;
    of the details. The average picture obtained by superimposing all pictures &#13;
    via a computer program then shows the correct shape, better than any isolated &#13;
    picture. Taking the contour of the bottom of the hinge beam as an example, &#13;
    the "mean picture" shows that it stops short of the hinge bolt locking plate. &#13;
    Many of the individual frames show the same thing. To comment only from an &#13;
    individual frame showing the opposite obviously becomes dubious. <br/>&#13;
    We are at the moment not exploring this matter further." </i><br/>&#13;
    In other words, the JAIC would completely disregard the evidence contained &#13;
    in this video and that's what they did. It was not mentioned at all in their &#13;
    Final Report. Hellberg, however, wrote again on 25 November, obviously after &#13;
    having spoken to Bryan Roberts: <br/>&#13;
    "Hinges of 'Estonia' Were Damaged.<br/>&#13;
    Dispute about video film, British photo expert rejects casualty investigation. &#13;
    By Anders Hellberg <br/>&#13;
    The 'Estonia' Commission does not believe in the information that the starboard &#13;
    hinge was dangerously damaged when 'Estonia' left Tallinn on the evening of &#13;
    the 27th September 1994. <br/>&#13;
    In case the Commission had taken another attitude a large part of the blame &#13;
    for the catastrophe would be with N&amp;T, having been respon-sible for the operation &#13;
    of the vessel, and with the classification society Bureau Veritas, who performed &#13;
    the inspections. <br/>&#13;
    The members and experts of the Commission, however, do not believe that it &#13;
    is possible to draw the same conclusions from the video, taken on board of &#13;
    'Estonia' weeks before the catastrophe, as the English photo analysis expert &#13;
    did.<br/><i>- "This is pure nonsense", said one of the members to DN during the meeting &#13;
    the Commission had in Stockholm last week. <br/>&#13;
    - "The total arm holding the visor is winding like a snake in the film due &#13;
    to unevenness of the video - it is not possible to draw conclusions from such &#13;
    material", said one of the experts. <br/>&#13;
    - "We do not trust the interpretation of the British photo expert who has &#13;
    been instructed by the German yard",</i> said another member. <br/>&#13;
    According to the Yard and the British photo interpretation expert Bryan Roberts &#13;
    the bolt, which holds the starboard hinge, is not there and the bushing through &#13;
    which the bolt should go is partly missing. Thereby the whole hinge should &#13;
    have been so dangerously weak-ened that it collapsed in the heavy weather &#13;
    and was also the cause for the visor to fall off. The Swedish experts of the &#13;
    intelligence Service, MUST, state in their short report that there are variations &#13;
    between different pictures of the film and that this should explain, among &#13;
    other things, why the bushing towards the bolt appears to be broken. <br/>&#13;
    Bryan Roberts said he was astonished by such an attitude: <br/><i>"It is obvious that on a number of picture details of the deck can be seen &#13;
    which should not be possible to be seen"</i> - this is a fact which is difficult &#13;
    to get around. There can be no doubt that the bolt of the hinge is missing.<br/>&#13;
    Roberts, who has long years of experience as a photo interpreter inside the &#13;
    British Military Intelligence Service, said he had used a number of pictures &#13;
    in video sequences and that his expert opinion therefore was not just based &#13;
    on one frame. <br/>&#13;
    Although the angle to the bushing was changed, it could be seen on a large &#13;
    number of frames on the video. "I cannot understand", said Roberts, <i>"how &#13;
    other experts can come to a conclusion other than mine. I would be pleased &#13;
    to meet them to discuss the matter." </i><br/>&#13;
    But the Commission consequently cannot trust Roberts without changing their &#13;
    initial opinion stated in the Part-Report from 1st April 1995, viz. that at &#13;
    first the locking devices failed before the hinges broke. According to the &#13;
    opinion of the yard, at first the hinges collapsed due to having been weakened &#13;
    before the locking devices at the bottom of the visor broke." <br/>&#13;
    Thereafter the video film was not mentioned again in the Swedish media but &#13;
    was brought back to the attention of the public by the Exhibitions held by &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997. See Subchapters &#13;
    40.2 / 40.3. </font></p>&#13;

    the Viking fleet under the original name. The technical operation was subcontracted &#13;
    with the remaining part of the Sally company.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In April 1990 the &#13;
    Effjohn group took over full operation of the vessel and transferred her to &#13;

    group, and was placed in the Wasa Line operation in the Gulf of Bothnia between &#13;
    Vaasa in Finland and Umeå and Sundsvall in Sweden. The ship was then renamed &#13;
    WASA KING. She operated on this route until she was sold to the Estline Marine &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The information obtained &#13;
    on the operation of the vessel is summarised as follows:</font></p>&#13;
  <ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also at sea the &#13;
      vessel was run all the time on a very tight schedule, i.e. with all 4 main &#13;
      engines constantly at 90% output, unless weather conditions commanded reduction.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the engine &#13;
      control room (ECR) there were two output regulators for the main engines &#13;
      which were normally set at 90%. The output of the propulsion plant could &#13;
      be changed from the ECR. The propulsion plant could be run on "Combinator" &#13;
      or on "Constant Revolutions". Except during yard trials in 1980 the "Combinator" &#13;
      mode was always used. Up to 70% output pitch and revolutions were increasing &#13;
      simultaneously until the maximum revolutions were reached. Thereafter the &#13;
      output could be further increased by increasing the pitch while the revolutions &#13;
      remained unchanged. </font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has to be &#13;
      remembered that VIKING SALLY was originally built for traffic within the &#13;
      archipelago. When trading in the open Baltic in heavy seas a tendency of &#13;
      the visor to move sideways was observed which was created by the recess &#13;
      in the shell plating aft of the visor and caused the bow to set-in very &#13;
      heavily. When the vessel was, however, proceeding against head seas the &#13;
      pressure on the visor was in the aft direction. (Force direction is aft.)</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reduction of &#13;
      speed in heavy head seas is not only a question of reduction of stress on &#13;
      vessel's and visor's structure and fixing points, but also the comfort of &#13;
      passengers has to be taken into account. Lars Karlsson made at least 1000 &#13;
      cruises and more than 100 times reduced the engine output himself in the &#13;
      engine room when he considered it necessary in heavy weather. He did so &#13;
      for the last times in July 1991 when the vessel was already sailing as WASA &#13;
      KING between Vaasa and Umeå/Sundsvall and consequently the vessel arrived &#13;
      once 11/2 hours late and another time 21/2 hours late.</font></li>&#13;

      was sailing between Turku and Stockholm there had to be two officers and &#13;
      one AB on the bridge. When she was shifted to the Vaasa/Umeå trade the owners &#13;
      wanted to spare one officer, which was accepted by F.B.N. under the condition &#13;
      that the control panel for the indicator lights for visor and bow ramp were &#13;
      moved to the large operation panel in front of the bridge where the lights &#13;
      could be seen from the seats of master and watch-officer. This was done &#13;
      some time in 1991.</font></li>&#13;
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck &#13;
      4 cameras were installed prior to delivery in 1980, i.e. one forward towards &#13;
      the forward ramp, two at the sides and one looking aft towards the stern &#13;
      ramp. The cameras could be moved and also had zoom ability. Monitors were &#13;
      on the bridge (located at port side of the entrance to the chart room) and &#13;
      in the ECR above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor &#13;
      could be changed to any other camera, either manually or automatically. &#13;
      The monitors on bridge and in ECR were showing the same picture. The main &#13;
      monitor with operating sticks was in the ECR, i.e. the bridge could not &#13;
      change to another camera nor operate the zoom. Later a further camera was &#13;
      installed at port side of the car deck, but it is unknown where and by whom &#13;
      the pictures were recorded.</font></li>&#13;

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC finally managed &#13;
    to complete their Report and publish the English version together with 2 Supplements &#13;
    on 3 December while the Swedish version took another year. Before the publication, &#13;
    however, many things happened which shall be explained in the following Subchapters. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.1 <br/>&#13;
    The Development until May 1997 </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">January: Due to the illness &#13;
    of Börje Stenström the position of the technical head of the JAIC was apparently &#13;
    taken over by Tuomo Karppinen assisted by Mikael Huss and Klaus Rahka. Karppinen &#13;
    phoned on 17 January and reported the following: <br/>&#13;
    - They are still making small changes to the report. They had the lugs of &#13;
    the Atlantic lock at VTT and have analysed the paint layers. They found some &#13;
    7-8, grey, white, red, blue paint and are certain now that the lugs were on &#13;
    board for quite some time.<br/>&#13;
    - They have also spoken to the Turku yard, who stated, never to have painted &#13;
    the forepeak deck area, thus it must have been the crew.<br/>&#13;
    - Have told him about the change of shape and he said the lugs from board &#13;
    have the same shape as the von Tell drawing and as the mock-up during the &#13;
    break tests, which is correct except that the aft part is vertically cut off. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - He is unable to give an estimate when their report might be completed, a &#13;
    lot depends on the meeting next week. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Helsinki &#13;
    on 24/25 January and continued to discuss the final version of the Report. &#13;
    The protocol of the previous meeting on 16/17 December in Pårnu was distributed. &#13;
    It reveals that Kari Lethola had spoken to Edelmann/F.B.N. who had told him &#13;
    that there were two persons in the administration, who knew that there was &#13;
    a "problem" with accepting the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision &#13;
    bulkhead, but that it was common practice to do so. <br/>&#13;
    This protocol further reveals that Tuomo Karppinen had contact to a Mr. Mäkälainen, &#13;
    who had stated that locking devices had been changed and that Uno Laur had &#13;
    demanded a written statement from this man. The person is unknown to this &#13;
    'Group of Experts' and nothing about him is mentioned in the JAIC Report. &#13;
    This and other protocols finally reveal, that the Sjöfartsverket "observer" &#13;
    Sten Andersson actively participated in the drafting of the Final Report. &#13;
    He was obviously treated as a commission member and apparently did behave &#13;
    like that. Enn Neidre participated also. <br/>&#13;
    From one of the relative organisations the information was received that the &#13;
    handling of the ESTONIA case by the Swedish Government had been moved away &#13;
    from the Ministry for Communication and Transport (Minister Inez Uzman) to &#13;
    the Ministry of Defence - "Department for Psychological Defence".</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> February: The JAIC met again &#13;
    in Helsinki on 19/20 February. The discussion of the chapters of the final &#13;
    Report was continued and Enn Neidre attended again. On 21 February Tuomo Karppinen &#13;
    phoned again and reported about the results of the meeting:<br/>&#13;
    - In principle they do agree on the contents of all the chapters - they however &#13;
    have to be proof-read. <br/>&#13;
    - But they did not agree on the conclusions and recommendations. Therefore &#13;
    they will meet again on 12 March and remain together until everything is agreed. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - The conclusion will be that one wave impact broke the visor at 01.00 hours. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - All attachments including the hinges broke a few minutes after 01.00 hours. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - The first water on the car deck was at 01.10.12. <br/>&#13;
    - Then it took about 10 minutes for the visor to cut through the deck beams &#13;
    and then the ramp was pulled open.<br/>&#13;
    - 01.20/22 the main engines stopped, vessel started to drift, starboard side &#13;
    to the wind. <br/>&#13;
    - Only two passengers have reported water in the 1st deck. <br/>&#13;
    Note: Actually 9 survivors reported water on the 1st deck, of which two already &#13;
    before the big heel.<br/>&#13;
    - At 01.30 hours ESTONIA was on the side. <br/>&#13;
    On 25 February Klaus Rahka reported the following: <br/>&#13;
    - He wanted the report from the Institute for all the break tests performed &#13;
    (was sent to him). <br/>&#13;
    - He promised to send a copy of the final findings (which he never did). <br/>&#13;
    - They ignored the passenger video - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter &#13;
    39.3</a> - because the pictures are jumping too much. It was explained to &#13;
    him that the pictures did not jump on the copy which was jointly viewed in &#13;
    Helsinki, but he was not interested. His attention was drawn to the fact that &#13;
    the starboard hinge bolt was standing without bushing on the rail, which confirmed &#13;
    that the bushing cannot have been complete as otherwise it couldn't have fallen &#13;
    off the bolt and would have remained attached to the bolt as evidently the &#13;
    point bushing did. He was not interested, the decision had already been made &#13;
    jointly. <br/>&#13;
    - They had come to the conclusion that the load on the visor was about 60 &#13;
    ts which was sufficient to break all the locks. <br/>&#13;
    - He believes that the welding seams of the 1st mock-up had been 5 mm instead &#13;
    of 3 mm. <br/>&#13;
    - Börje Stenström had now officially resigned from the case. Note: Börje Stenström &#13;
    passed away on 25 February.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> March: On 5 March Tuomo &#13;
    Karppinen faxed page 13 of the Draft Report and requested details about the &#13;
    communication between the yard/ BV/ von Tell, etc. which was complied with &#13;
    by sending the respective chapter of the Report of this 'Group of Experts'. &#13;
    From 12-16 March the JAIC met again to finalize the Report which failed, although &#13;
    - as stated above - it had been the intention to stay together until the last &#13;
    disputes were solved. On 17 March "DAGENS NYHETER" as well as "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" &#13;
    published articles about the internal disputes in the JAIC between Estonia &#13;
    on the one side and Sweden/Finland on the other concerning the behaviour of &#13;
    the crew, respectively how much blame was to be put on the crew. Furthermore, &#13;
    the attention of the public was drawn to the letter Stenström wrote at the &#13;
    beginning of December 1996 to Dr. Holtappels indicating that the JAIC would &#13;
    not point to Meyer Werft having installed the faulty locks by not excluding &#13;
    that the installations could have been changed after the vessel had left the &#13;
    yard. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: At the beginning of &#13;
    this month the stowage plan showing the reconstruction of the condition on &#13;
    the car deck according to the cargo manifest was sent from Hamburg to Helsinki. &#13;
    In exchange, a copy of the KTH-Report about the examination of the hinge material &#13;
    was received.<br/>&#13;
    During the second half of this month a contact to the Turku Repair Yard was &#13;
    established which resulted after some time in the receipt of very valuable &#13;
    documentation, i.e. the repair-specifications, -quotations and invoices concern-ing &#13;
    the time before, during and after the take-over of the ferry by N&amp;T - see &#13;
    <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.4.</a><br/>&#13;
    Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 23 April and requested help with regard to <br/>&#13;
    - the memo on magnetic limit switches (made up by the Estonian JAIC - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 12.5.172</a>); <br/>&#13;
    - type of these switches, names/telephone numbers of the electricians having &#13;
    installed them; <br/>&#13;
    all of which was sent to him. <br/>&#13;
    In exchange he sent the Leif Bogren and the Hangö statements, which were received &#13;
    the following day. <br/>&#13;
    He reported further that proof-reading and lay-out of the Report would not &#13;
    be completed before the end of May, i.e. the Report might be printed before &#13;
    midsummer, thus could be published just before the vacation season begins, &#13;
    which the JAIC would prefer. <br/>&#13;
    At a meeting on 18 April with the Stockholm public relations company H&amp;H the &#13;
    idea was developed to present the findings of this 'Group of Experts' to the &#13;
    Swedish public at an exhibition in Stockholm at the same time when the Report &#13;
    of the JAIC was presented and the media and the public could come to the exhibition &#13;
    and check, compare and discuss the results. This was decided during the following &#13;
    days and the time was set for the week before midsummer, which left two months &#13;
    for preparations.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Tuomo Karppinen phoned &#13;
    on 6 May and stated that <br/>&#13;
    - they were still proof-reading;<br/>&#13;
    - they had planned some sort of seminar under the chairmanship of Prof. Rutgersson &#13;
    from KTH in Stockholm where they wanted to present their technical findings &#13;
    to raise the profile of the JAIC, however this can, of course, only be done &#13;
    after the publication of their final report, which will probably be during &#13;
    the week before midsummer. <br/>&#13;
    On 16 May Karppinen phoned again and told that they were making good progress, &#13;
    about half of the Report was already in the printing house in Helsinki. The &#13;
    day before they had gone through part of the Report with their English language &#13;
    expert. It is most unlikely that they will attend the seminar. It is still &#13;
    under consideration between Kari Lethola, Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg whether &#13;
    this 'Group of Experts' will get the part of their Report dealing with Meyer &#13;
    Werft matters.<br/>&#13;
    On 20 May journalist Anders Hellberg from DAGENS NYHETER reported that the &#13;
    seminar had been postponed. </font></p>&#13;

    <br/>&#13;
    The Dismissal of Olof Forssberg</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 26 May the interview &#13;
    quote below by radio journalist Erik Ridderstolpe with Olof Forssberg was &#13;
    broadcasted in Swedish Radio:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Journalist (J), Olof Forssberg &#13;
    (OF)<br/>&#13;
    "Speaker: The Swedish chairman of the JAIC has lied about a letter concerning &#13;
    important facts about why Estonia and other vessels were built in an incorrect &#13;
    way. Despite the fact that Olof Forssberg has been assigned by the government &#13;
    to lead the commission's work in trying to establish the truth behind the &#13;
    sinking of Estonia, he has repeatedly lied.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> J: So you have never seen &#13;
    this letter?<br/>&#13;
    OF: No. <br/>&#13;
    J: Never at all?<br/>&#13;
    OF: No. It must have been delivered faulty. I will receive a new copy on Monday &#13;
    ... It wasn't today's mail.<br/>&#13;
    J: Isn't that strange since the letter was sent to you a long time ago. <br/>&#13;
    OF: These things happen. The post is not always reliable. <br/>&#13;
    J: So you haven't seen what this letter contains at all? <br/>&#13;
    OF: No. <br/>&#13;
    Speaker </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Olof Forssberg &#13;
    is chairman of the JAIC. He is the one responsible for establishing the truth &#13;
    behind the catastrophe. He has already been heavily criticised for his way &#13;
    of handling the investigation. This time the issue is sensitive information &#13;
    about the Sjöfartsverket. It is information that shows that Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    for many years didn't control the placement of the very important collision &#13;
    bulkhead that shall prevent water from entering the car deck in an emergency &#13;
    situation. If Estonia's collision bulkhead had been placed in the right position, &#13;
    the vessel would never have sunk. Olof Forssberg has received and read the &#13;
    letter, but had not registered it. He has deliberately or non-deliberately &#13;
    misplaced the letter. At least one other occasion he has denied that he has &#13;
    received the letter, and he has asked the sender to sent the letter again &#13;
    just so that it would seem as if he had never received it. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">J: But I just can't understand &#13;
    why you are lying?<br/>&#13;
    OF: I can't understand it either and I must say that I am ashamed over having &#13;
    lied. I have no explanation. I regret that I have been handling the truth &#13;
    carelessly. The reason I have asked you to come here today is partly that &#13;
    I want to explain that I have been lying and also apologise to you.<br/>&#13;
    J: Is this common behaviour for the chairman of the JAIC?<br/></font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> OF: Absolutely not. &#13;
    It goes without saying that the answer to that question is no. <br/>&#13;
    J: Is this the way you normally handle documents? <br/>&#13;
    OF: Absolutely not. I always register documents very carefully. Actually I &#13;
    think that the reason for this omission, or rather consequence of, was the &#13;
    fact that the person who handles the Estonia file was on vacation.<br/>&#13;
    J: How do you think this affects the credibility of the JAIC?<br/>&#13;
    OF: This is what concerns me most. There have been a few occasions where I &#13;
    not even today can understand why I have acted with such a lack of judgement &#13;
    in certain situations. <br/>&#13;
    J: The motive behind this is still not quite clear. Why did you lie about &#13;
    the letter? <br/>&#13;
    OF: ..I...the..hm..I don't think that the motive is unclear. Quite simply &#13;
    this document was received or I read it through and I put it somewhere and &#13;
    then I didn't think anymore about it. <br/>&#13;
    J: But it is one thing to do that, and quite another to deny the existence &#13;
    of the document. And also you don't have the document here in your office. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    OF: ...n..ne...I...I don't know where it is right now, the letter has now &#13;
    been miscarried but that is not a problem since I have asked the sender to &#13;
    send the same letter once more.<br/>&#13;
    J. That you did in order to look good and so that you could say that you had &#13;
    now received the letter. <br/>&#13;
    OF: I have now explained the whole situation to you and I think that, well, &#13;
    that things are as they are." </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The subject of the discussion &#13;
    which subsequently turned out to be the reason for the dismissal of Olof Forssberg &#13;
    by Minister Inez Uzman is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.2.3.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosure 2.2.3</a>. It is a letter concerning a directors' meeting at Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    dated 07.04.59. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 28 May Tuomo Karppinen &#13;
    phoned and reported the following: <br/>&#13;
    - Ridderstolpe from Swedish Radio had phoned Forssberg and asked whether he &#13;
    had received a paper from 1959, of which he, Karppinen, also has a copy. Forssberg's &#13;
    answer was no, although he knew that he had the copy but could not find it. &#13;
    He asked Sjöfartsverket to send the letter again which was, however, delayed. &#13;
    So he told Ridderstolpe that he did not have it and never saw it and was subsequently &#13;
    proven to have lied. The first letter was not registered because it was considered &#13;
    unimportant. Ridderstolpe got a tip from somebody inside Sjöfartsverket.<br/>&#13;
    - General Director of "Statens Havarie Kommission" (SHK) is a full time job. &#13;
    In case the Government should decide to put an outsider in this position, &#13;
    it will take several months and will cause further delay to the publication &#13;
    of the Report. Therefore it has to be assumed that it will be somebody from &#13;
    the Government administration.<br/>&#13;
    - He has sent two more Chapters to the printing house. <br/>&#13;
    - They are still of the opinion that it all started with the failure of the &#13;
    visor locking devices on course 287° and full speed, but some within the JAIC &#13;
    believe that it started with the hinges.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Olof Forssberg was dismissed &#13;
    from his position as Chairman of the JAIC on 27 May and replaced by Ann-Louise &#13;
    Eksborg on 16 June. The lady had been working in the legal department of the &#13;
    Ministry of Defence before. Also on the same day Captain Olle Noord, nautical &#13;
    expert up to that time, was appointed member in replacement of Börje Stenström, &#13;
    i.e. now two master mariners were members (Rosengren and Noord). Naval architects &#13;
    were no more present in the JAIC, which, however, did not mean that more emphasis &#13;
    was put on the up to then widely neglected nautical aspects of the case. Olof &#13;
    Forssberg attended for the last time at a working meeting of the Swedish part &#13;
    of the JAIC on 4 June. <br/>&#13;
    Note: Olof Forssberg was very soon appointed an appeal court judge. One wonders. &#13;

    The First Exhibition in Stockholm </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">40.2.1<br/>&#13;
    Preparations </font></b></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The investigation events &#13;
    were summarized in a brochure in English and Swedish languages - the English &#13;
    version is attached as Enclosure 40.2 - which were distributed to the visitors. &#13;
    In further preparation, two exhibition guides were acquainted with the investigation &#13;
    results, these were <br/>&#13;
    - from Sweden, Captain Erland von Hofsten, 68 years old, retired Stena Line &#13;
    captain and Chairman of the Swedish Sailors Foundation, and <br/>&#13;
    - from Finland, Captain Peter Jansson, 53 years old, maritime consultant and &#13;
    owner of Oy Mariners Assistance, Porvoo. <br/>&#13;
    Both spent one week in Hamburg, read through the material, viewed the videos &#13;
    and discussed open questions with this 'Group of Experts'. <br/>&#13;
    For the exhibition the history of the vessel from newbuilding to sinking was &#13;
    illustrated on big paper sheets. In addition, the topics of the investigation, &#13;
    e.g. the passenger video, the condition of the visor hinges, etc. were illustrated &#13;
    on separate sheets. Furthermore, one of the mock-ups of the Atlantic locks, &#13;
    broken at the break test, a model of the "VIKING SALLY", models of intact &#13;
    and damaged visor hinges, the hinge mock-up with the burning test, numerous &#13;
    drawings and other documentations of interest were shown at the exhibition &#13;
    which took place in the "Gamla Spårvägshallarna" on Birger Jarlsgatan in the &#13;
    centre of Stockholm. <br/>&#13;
    While the preparations were in progress the chairman of the Swedish JAIC, &#13;
    Olof Forssberg, was dismissed, which triggered off a wave of speculations &#13;
    and, last but not least, caused a new delay of the publication of the JAIC &#13;
    Report. After careful consideration of all circumstances it was decided to &#13;
    continue with the preparations and to open the exhibition - as planned - on &#13;
    Thursday, 12 June, because it was possible by this exhibition to fill the &#13;
    gap which had doubtlessly been created by the new postponement of the publication &#13;
    of the JAIC Report. </font></p>&#13;

    The Exhibition</b> </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Exhibition was opened &#13;
    on 12 June at 10.00 hours with a presentation for invited guests. Invitations &#13;
    had been sent to the JAIC chairman, members of the Government and of Parliament. &#13;
    About 30 persons of the invited persons appeared, among others: <br/>&#13;
    - Lennart Berglund/Odd Lundqvist - SEA Relative Organisation <br/>&#13;
    - Gunnar Benndreus/Henning Witte/Alve Wendt - DIS Relative Organisation<br/>&#13;
    - Prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand <br/>&#13;
    - Sjöfartsverket Director Johann Fransson<br/>&#13;
    - Jörgen Almelöv - Lawyer of N&amp;T <br/>&#13;
    - Carl Romare - Skuld / Stockholm <br/>&#13;
    - Lawyers from Skuld / Estline / ESCO <br/>&#13;
    - one representative of Trygg Hansa - the leading Hull Underwriters of "ESTONIA" &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - Pierre Frey of Bureau Veritas/Paris <br/>&#13;
    - Bureau Veritas Stockholm - Lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> No one from the JAIC, the &#13;
    Government or the Parliament appeared. <br/>&#13;
    About 50 journalists attended the following press conference. They came mainly &#13;
    from Sweden, but also from Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Germany. &#13;
    Various TV and radio programs were present with own teams and a considerable &#13;
    number of interviews were made. On the next morning, however, there were only &#13;
    small articles in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and TT NEWS, while TV 1 and TV 4 mentioned &#13;
    the exhibition briefly in their evening news. The question arose why the Swedish &#13;
    media were suddenly so disinterested. Nevertheless the Swedish public, informed &#13;
    about the exhibition by various advertisements, had a different opinion and &#13;
    visited the exhibition in daily growing members while the media remained silent. &#13;
    Only in DAGENS NYHETER on the "Debate" page did one letter from the N&amp;T lawyer, &#13;
    Jörgen Almelöv, appear, which was written in response to the letter of Dr. &#13;
    Holtappels having been published on the same page the day before the exhibition &#13;
    was opened. Among the daily increasing number of visitors were retired captains, &#13;
    pilots, professors from the Royal Technical High Schools in Stockholm and &#13;
    Gothenburg, but also relatives, survivors and previous passengers. Even the &#13;
    master, the chief mate and the chief engineer from "REGINA BALTICA", the ferry &#13;
    having replaced the ESTONIA, visited the exhibition twice and took information &#13;
    material with them. <br/>&#13;
    The Finnish JAIC chairman Kari Lethola came with two assistants and stayed &#13;
    for 11/2 hours, the investigating public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand came &#13;
    twice with criminal inspector Bo Wide. Both stayed for several hours. Also &#13;
    several employees of Sjöfartsverket appeared and very interesting discussions &#13;
    took place. Most important were the many statements taken from previous passengers, &#13;
    in particular truck drivers, which provided new and more detailed evidence &#13;
    about the disastrous condition of visor and bow ramp including hinges and &#13;
    locking devices, all of which were incorporated into the report of this 'Group &#13;
    of Experts'. See Subchapters <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3 /</a> &#13;
    <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br/>&#13;
    On the last day the relatives organisation DIS held their press conference &#13;
    inside the exhibition to demonstrate their appreciation for the work of this &#13;
    'Group of Experts' and its preparedness to show the results in Stockholm. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    At the exit of the exhibition a black book had been waiting for entries by &#13;
    visitors about their impressions and feelings after having seen the exhibition &#13;
    and the result was overwhelming as demonstrated by the Swedish original and &#13;
    the English translation attached as Enclosures <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480</a> &#13;
    / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480.1a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480.1.</a> &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    On Thursday, 19 June, the day before the Midsummer celebrations would commence, &#13;
    the exhibition was closed after having been open for 7 full days, during which &#13;
    approximately 1200 visitors saw the exhibition.<br/>&#13;
    In summary it has to be concluded that the exhibition had been a great success, &#13;
    in spite of the silence of the media. The visitors appreciated the opportunity &#13;
    to study the history of the vessel from design/construction to the sinking, &#13;
    the many photos, drawings, the models and mock-up, all of which was explained &#13;
    to them, if they wished so. Many regretted what they thought was a too early &#13;
    closing, however, accepted the reasons, viz. that it would make little sense &#13;
    to kept he exhibition open through Midsummer. Many visitors urged the exhibition &#13;
    guides to request Mr. Bernard Meyer urgently to make sure that the exhibition &#13;
    would be made available again to the Swedish public once the JAIC would finally &#13;
    publish their report. Many visitors demanded a new diving investigation to &#13;
    establish the real truth of the catastrophe. <br/>&#13;
    It became obvious that the Swedish public and in particular the relatives &#13;
    did realize that this 'Group of Experts' - contrary to all publications and &#13;
    assumptions - really had done their utmost to uncover the real facts and circumstances &#13;
    having led to the catastrophe, and still continues to do so as demonstrated &#13;
    at the exhibition. The message from many relatives and survivors, that it &#13;
    is of utmost importance to them to know, what really happened, was understood &#13;
    and, also, that they felt to be left absolutely alone by their authorities. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    Furthermore, it was realised and accepted that there was serious and convincing &#13;
    evidence available indicating a much better and more logical casualty scenario &#13;
    than that published so far by the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
    The visitors also understood that a substantial part of the responsibility &#13;
    for the catastrophe was resting with their own Sjöfartsverket and many did &#13;
    express their deep concern about it. The recent resignation of the Swedish &#13;
    JAIC chairman Olof Forssberg in this connection did increase the ill feelings &#13;
    of many visitors.<br/>&#13;
    Basically it became clear to most visitors that the main blame was resting &#13;
    with the technical managers and part owners N&amp;T, the crew managers and part &#13;
    owners ESCO and the classification society Bureau Veritas. Many visitors were &#13;
    shocked that the ferry in such condition could depart every 2nd day from a &#13;
    Swedish port with 1000 or more Swedes onboard, without any Swedish authority &#13;
    doing anything to prevent it. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Swedish Government, when &#13;
    faced with the facts shown at the exhibition, reacted as follows: <br/>&#13;
    - The responsible Minister of Communication, Inez Uzman, remained silent and &#13;
    did not attend. <br/>&#13;
    - The same refers to the members of the Swedish JAIC (only the expert Mikael &#13;
    Huss visited the exhibition in his own time). <br/>&#13;
    - The only "officials" were Johan Fransson from Sjöfartsverket and prosecutor &#13;
    Tomas Lindstrand. </font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Operation of the ESTONIA &#13;
      was under the supervision of the Navigational Department of ESCO. The crew &#13;
      was provided by the Personnel Department of ESCO. Two full crews were employed, &#13;
      manning the ship in two-week shifts each. The qualifications and training &#13;
      of the crew are described in Chapter 4. <br/>&#13;
      The master taking over a shift was required to visit the ESCO Navigational, &#13;
      Technical and Personnel departments for briefing. The master being relieved &#13;
      likewise had to report personally to the navigational department of ESCO &#13;
      on the situation on board. <br/>&#13;
      A captain's meeting was held at the ESCO office once a week attended by &#13;
      all masters in Tallinn on that day, including those on vacation. Regular &#13;
      meetings were also held on board the ESTONIA, attended by the masters, chief &#13;
      officers and chief engineers of both shifts and by representatives from &#13;
      ESCO and from Nordström &amp; Thulin AB." That means that the Navigational Department &#13;
      of ESCO was responsible for the "operation of the ESTONIA" and that the &#13;
      master of the ESTONIA, before taking over the command of a new shift, was &#13;
      briefed by this department. Head of the Navigational Department was Captain &#13;
      Enn Neidre, who participated in all meetings at first as member and subsequently &#13;
      as Expert to the Estonian JAIC. Enn Neidre thus participated in the investigation &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here the JAIC describes &#13;
      in detail which inspections were carried out by Port State Control and the &#13;
      surveyor of the Classification Society "in line with common practice and &#13;
      requirements". The JAIC has always known positively that neither the visor &#13;
      nor the forward ramp of the vessel were weather- respectively watertight. &#13;
      (See Subchapter 38.2.) The JAIC was at all times furthermore aware, that &#13;
      the vessel - on the route Tallinn-Stockholm - did not comply with stringent &#13;
      SOLAS requirements with regard to the position of the upper extension of &#13;
      the collision bulkhead above main deck. (See Subchapter 6.5.2.) Such deficiencies &#13;
      render any such vessel unseaworthy without any further debate. If the inspectors &#13;
      appointed by the Swedish government to execute Port State Control or the &#13;
      surveyor of the Classification Society overlook such deficiencies then such &#13;
      behaviour is not considered to be "in line with common practice and requirements" &#13;
      amongst reputable members of the shipping community. It is furthermore noteworthy &#13;
      that the JAIC in this Chapter describes the delivery drydocking in Turku &#13;
      "in 1993" without any mention of the Repair List issued by the former owners &#13;
      and known to the representatives of the new Owners. (See Subchapters 6.5. &#13;
      and 12.5. and Supplement 231 to the JAIC Report). This list - as described &#13;
      in detail in Subchapter 12.5 - contains the root of all the deficiencies, &#13;
      the further worsening of which later led to the catastrophe. Given this &#13;
      fact, hardly any interested reader will consider the following casual remark, &#13;
      which can be found in Chapter 3.3.6., to be a satisfactory description of &#13;
      the problem:<br/><i>"Just before transfer to Estonian flag by the end of 1992 attention had &#13;
      been given to the strength of the ramp and visor locking devices and a quotation &#13;
      for reinforcing them had been requested by Wasa Line. However, nothing was &#13;
      made to the locking devices." </i></font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">8. JAIC Chapter &#13;
    3.3.5 : </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC states here (page &#13;
      42, middle column): <br/>&#13;
      "It has been stated that the lower locking bolt on the port side of the &#13;
      ramp sometimes failed to go to fully extended position. The standard procedure &#13;
      was then to retract the bolt and again command it to locked position, whereby &#13;
      it would normally go to fully extended position and the green indicator &#13;
      lamp would come on." <br/>&#13;
      Evidently the lower port locking bolt of the bow ramp could not engage the &#13;
      mating pocket at the ramp side and consequently also not contact the sensor &#13;
      because the port side of the ramp was misaligned by ca. 21/2 inches = 10 &#13;
      cm (diver's statement 2.12.94 - see Subchapters 27 and 29.2) which had the &#13;
      consequence that neither the upper port bolt nor the port ramp (pull-in) &#13;
      hook of the bow ramp were able to engage their respective mating pocket/mating &#13;
      lug. The cause for this severe misalignment was the collapse of the port &#13;
      outer ramp hinge - see Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 - by which the lugs connecting &#13;
      the ramp with the vessel slid off the pin respectively broke. This had been &#13;
      known to the technical managers and the crew since several weeks before &#13;
      the casualty and the crew had - according to Börje Stenström - Enclosure &#13;
      12.5.166 - frequently asked for repairs by putting this item on the repair &#13;
      list. Although these circumstances - as stated above - rendered the ESTONIA &#13;
      unseaworthy they are not mentioned in the Final Report. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">9. JAIC Chapter &#13;
    3.3.6:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here we read: <i><br/>&#13;
      "After transfer to Estonian flag no more service work was carried out by &#13;
      the MacGregor service base in Turku as the regular maintenance was carried &#13;
      out by the ship's crew and, according to the new owners, no need for external &#13;
      service had developed. New rubber seals had, how ever been ordered. It was &#13;
      known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point where corrective &#13;
      action would be needed." </i><br/>&#13;
      In this respect reference is made to Subchapters 12.4 and 12.5 where the &#13;
      observations of the many previous passengers are reported. Contrary to the &#13;
      statement of the new Owners, upon which the JAIC apparently relied, many &#13;
      repairs were carried out both to visor and bow ramp parts, partly with heavy &#13;
      burning and welding. There were frequent problems with opening of the locking &#13;
      devices of the visor and/or the bow ramp after arrival in Tallinn which &#13;
      sometimes made it necessary to tow the ferry away from the berth, turn her &#13;
      around and berth her again stern first. This subsequently created very substantial &#13;
      difficulties for the trucks to turn around and leave the car deck.<br/>&#13;
      As stated by witnesses the lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt &#13;
      off and subsequently rewelded. In this text reference is also made to the &#13;
      divers' report - see Chapters 29.2 and 30 - who stated when inspecting the &#13;
      lugs of the side locks still in the wreck that only a very small piece of &#13;
      (white) visor bulkhead was attached to the lug, otherwise there were only &#13;
      very thick welding seams. Nevertheless there were rectangular holes of the &#13;
      size of the lugs in the visor plating which means that the lugs were since &#13;
      some time before the casualty not welded anymore to the visor plating but &#13;
      only stuck through the existing rectangular holes and then spot-welded from &#13;
      outside and/or inside which explains the extraordinary thick welding seams &#13;
      on the lugs. Thereby it was possible for the crew to adjust the lugs to &#13;
      the changing distance between visor-platings and vessel-platings which increased &#13;
      due to the growing misalignment of the visor. These very obvious deficiencies &#13;
      have apparently not been investigated by the JAIC at all and consequently &#13;
      also not taken into consideration when calculating the remaining load carrying &#13;
      capacity of these lugs. Instead the JAIC based their calculations on newbuilding &#13;
      standard. The JAIC continues further on page 43:<br/><i>"Minor routine welding repairs had been carried out on the mating boxes &#13;
      for the ramp locking bolts whilst the ship was in service in the Gulf of &#13;
      Bothnia." </i><br/>&#13;
      Actually when the vessel was in service between Stockholm and Tallinn the &#13;
      top plates of these mating boxes were frequently burnt off by crew members &#13;
      when they were unable to disengage the bolt after arrival at Tallinn. Subsequently &#13;
      the plates were rewelded. Reportedly this was also done after the last arrival &#13;
      on the morning of 27 September 1994 when the starboard upper mating box &#13;
      had been burnt open but the plate had obviously not been rewelded because &#13;
      the box is still open with no sign of the top plate. See Chapter 29.2. <br/><i>"Local welding of a crack in a stiffener underneath the mounting platform &#13;
      for the port side visor actuator has been noted."</i> <br/>&#13;
      Actually the two lugs by the port visor actuator were found to have been &#13;
      in the following condition:<br/>&#13;
      - The outer stiffener had been very poorly repair-welded some considerable &#13;
      time before the casualty. <br/>&#13;
      - The inner stiffener was no more the original one since it did not show &#13;
      any protective coating and it was only spot welded to the deck - if at all. &#13;
      All stiffeners however were fully welded to the deck by the shipyard during &#13;
      newbuilding, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      For details see Chapter 30 - pages 990-1002. The JAIC continues further &#13;
      on the same page: <br/><i>"One of the visor hinge pins had, according to verbal information, a &#13;
      tendency to move out of position, breaking away the locking plate. This &#13;
      was repaired once at the Finnboda yard by pushing the hinge pin back in &#13;
      place and drilling for new locking bolts.<br/>&#13;
      No other repair was, according to available information and extensive search, &#13;
      carried out during the lifetime of the vessel on or in the areas of the &#13;
      various operating and locking devices for the ramp and the visor." </i><br/>&#13;
      This is wrong for the following reasons: <br/>&#13;
      - According to the statement of the long-term chief officer Stig Lindström &#13;
      (( January 1996) one of the visor locking devices had to be strengthened &#13;
      some time before the sale - see Enclosure 3.4.101 and in the Swedish JAIC &#13;
      register D11.<br/>&#13;
      - The JAIC was made aware of several statements of truck drivers that the &#13;
      lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt off and that the ESTONIA berthed &#13;
      sometimes stern first in Tallinn in July, August, September 1994 because &#13;
      visor and/or bow ramp could not be opened upon arrival, but subsequently, &#13;
      after certain repairs could be operated again.<br/>&#13;
      - Truck drivers have also directly reported to the JAIC that the port side &#13;
      of the bow ramp was severely misaligned, was actually hanging down and could &#13;
      not be properly closed since some time before the casualty.<br/>&#13;
      - Truck drivers have also reported to the JAIC that securing bolts could &#13;
      not be opened and therefore the top plates of the mating boxes at the ramp &#13;
      were burnt off. <br/>&#13;
      - Passengers/truck drivers have furthermore directly reported that the ferry &#13;
      after having berthed bow first in Tallinn, was subsequently towed back and &#13;
      turned by tugs and subsequently berthed stern first whereafter the trucks &#13;
      could leave the car deck only with difficulties which reports have made &#13;
      available to the JAIC.<br/>&#13;
      - The JAIC has in its possession a video film made by a passenger upon departure &#13;
      from Tallinn on 17.09.94 which clearly shows that the starboard visor hinge &#13;
      had been repaired very badly with disastrous effect on the load carrying &#13;
      capacity.<br/>&#13;
      - The as-found condition of the bushings and hinge plate parts of the starboard &#13;
      visor hinge arrangement confirms the above. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC also neglected the old damages in the visor, apparently caused &#13;
      when the ESTONIA was used as an "ice breaker" and was forcing ice barriers &#13;
      several meters high at full speed according to passenger information, which &#13;
      are known to the JAIC. See Chapters 12.4.2 and 30.<br/>&#13;
      Also the very fresh footprints on the 3rd and 2nd stringers of the visor &#13;
      were not explained in the JAIC Report although the last JAIC chairman, Uno &#13;
      Laur, has stated that they were created by crew members when they went down &#13;
      to hammer open or close the bolt of the Atlantic lock before arrival and &#13;
      after departure from Tallinn. The reason was the impossibility to open/close &#13;
      the bolt hydraulically because the visor was that much misaligned and the &#13;
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were that much deformed. See Enclosure 12.5.175. &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Interim Passenger &#13;
      Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) was false. It confirms that the vessel fulfils &#13;
      the SOLAS requirements, which however it did not in respect of the location &#13;
      of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead. On the ESTONIA this was &#13;
      the bow ramp, which was positioned too much forward. Since the Tallinn-Stockholm &#13;
      route - contrary to the Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm route - leads more than &#13;
      20 nm away from the nearest land, no exemption was permissible. The "partial &#13;
      collision door" initially offered by Meyer Werft but rejected by AB Sally &#13;
      against a credit of DM 45.000,00 should have been installed prior to taking &#13;
      up the Stockholm-Tallinn service. This was not done and thus the ferry did &#13;
      not comply with the SOLAS requirements and consequently the PSSC confirming &#13;
      this was false. The JAIC finds it appropriate to explain the failure of &#13;
      Bureau Veritas in the issuance of the false PSSC with words, that stem from &#13;
      Bureau Veritas, namely:<br/><i>"When Bureau Veritas surveyed the vessel for change of flag this was &#13;
      done in accordance with the requirements to the extent of a periodic survey, &#13;
      which did not include examination of construction drawings. The location &#13;
      of the extension of the collision bulkhead was thus not considered during &#13;
      this survey."</i><br/>&#13;
      It is doubtful, whether a periodic survey did suffice (see Subchapter 6.5.2.) &#13;
      and it may also be debated whether inspection of the structure of a passenger &#13;
      ship does not also include a check of the design drawings. The essential &#13;
      point in this case is that Bureau Veritas had accompanied this vessel since &#13;
      its birth and hence perfectly well knew her design. Their own form for the &#13;
      Survey Report as a prerequisite for the issuance of a PSSC demanded the &#13;
      inspector to check the structure of the vessel! (See Subchapter 6.5.2). &#13;
      The same is true for the Load Line Certificate, allegedly issued on 9 September &#13;
      1994, which confirmed that the vessel complied with the requirements of &#13;
      the International Load Line Convention. This the vessel did not for the &#13;
      simple reason, that its hull was not closed watertight against the seas &#13;
      at its bow. Both parts of the double security to ensure this state, namely &#13;
      the visor and the ramp, were not watertight. See Chapters 12.4.3 and 12.5. &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here the following comments &#13;
      seem to be appropriate: At the time of the casualty a new Trim and Stability &#13;
      Booklet was not yet available, but was still in progress, therefore the &#13;
      PSSC and Load Line Certificates were issued only interim and B.V. had to &#13;
      carry out Load Line Surveys every 3 months. In relation to the Trim and &#13;
      Stability Booklet valid at the time of flag change which had been approved &#13;
      by the F.B.N. on 20.01.91 the JAIC states among other things: <br/><i>"The Commission has noted that at the inclination test, the ship's centre &#13;
      of gravity was positioned to starboard to such an extent that the port side &#13;
      heeling tank was filled with about 115 t more water than the starboard tank &#13;
      in upright condition. The load cases in the trim and stability manual, however, &#13;
      include the heeling tanks as being either both empty or both full.</i>" &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      Such a condition did not exist during the initial inclination test performed &#13;
      in the presence of Gunnar Edelman of the F.B.N. on 21.06.80 in Papenburg &#13;
      and it was unknown what had caused such unfavourable weight distribution &#13;
      101/2 years after delivery. <br/>&#13;
      Had the JAIC investigated this matter and not left it as mystery, they would &#13;
      probably have found the same answer as this "Group of Experts", namely a &#13;
      hole in the underwater hull which opened a tank or void space to the outside &#13;
      and thereby permitted the creation of unknown weights in the vessel. (See &#13;
      Subchapter 17.1) </font></p>&#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here the JAIC states:<br/><i>"On departure from Tallinn on 27 September the ESTONIA was seaworthy &#13;
      and properly manned. There were no outstanding items either from the authorities &#13;
      or from the classification society's surveys. The maintenance standard of &#13;
      the vessel was good as witnessed by various instances." </i><br/>&#13;
      It has been stated before, that this statement is not only untrue, but that &#13;
      it has also been made with full knowledge of it not containing the truth. &#13;
      This Group of Experts is not the only one to say so.<br/>&#13;
      Last - but not least - the chairman of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' &#13;
      Association, Captain Christer Lindvall, has frequently condemned the findings &#13;
      of the JAIC. With good reason. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC further comments on the "Port State Control" carried out until &#13;
      shortly before the last departure: <br/><i>"During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme &#13;
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port &#13;
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on &#13;
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough &#13;
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed &#13;
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise &#13;
      was documen-ted in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. &#13;
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement." </i><br/>&#13;
      With regard to the inspection and the protocol reference is made to SUBCHAPTERS &#13;
      34.1 and 36.1. Evidently several different versions of this protocol do &#13;
      exist with the knowledge of Sjöfartsverket and the JAIC.<br/><i>"The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by &#13;
      the Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and &#13;
      very well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused &#13;
      detention or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular &#13;
      Port State Control." </i>Contrary to the statement the Swedes have actually &#13;
      tried to prevent the departure of the ferry after having detected the many &#13;
      serious deficiencies which are noted in the protocol registered in the files &#13;
      of the Swedish JAIC under A 46 b - see Enclosures 15.200 - see Chapters &#13;
      15 and 36.1. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC continues: <br/><i>"However, some deficiencies were noted, such as that the rubber seals &#13;
      for the bow visor were worn, had tear marks in some places, and were in &#13;
      need of replacement, and watertight hatch covers on the car deck were open &#13;
      and in a condition indicating that at least one was not normally closed. &#13;
      It was also stated during the interrogation that the Swedish inspectors &#13;
      had experienced "lack of respect for issues related to load line matters" &#13;
      in their contact with officers met during the exercise." </i><br/>&#13;
      Whichever protocol is the correct one, they all contained deficiencies rated &#13;
      17, which means that they should have been mandatorily remedied before departure. &#13;
      The protocol contained in the Supplement to the JAIC Report (Enclosure 15.200) &#13;
      contains no less than 7 of such deficiencies, none of which was remedied &#13;
      before departure. <br/>&#13;
      In a telephone conversation after the hearing of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar &#13;
      Zahlée by the Swedish JAIC between Bengt Schager and Åke Sjöblom, the latter &#13;
      did state, that the ESTONIA and her crew were the worst that he had ever &#13;
      experienced. </font></p>&#13;

    expert to the Swedish JAIC, who wanted to interrogate all the important witnesses &#13;
    separately, including the passengers, was precluded from doing so by Olof &#13;
    Forssberg, with the exception of the purser Andres Vihmar, whom he questioned &#13;

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> and decided already at &#13;
      a very early stage to rely almost exclusively on the statements of 3rd engineer &#13;
      Margus Treu and A.B. Silver Linde as far as the casualty scenario is concerned. &#13;
      As demonstrated in Subchapter 21.2. the numerous statements of these gentlemen &#13;
      are better evaluated with utmost care and when doing so another consideration &#13;
      should be taken into account. It is a fact well known in the shipping community, &#13;
      that crew members generally tend to be very loyal to their owners and, as &#13;
      a matter of fact, it has been confirmed by Börje Stenström to a member of &#13;
      this 'Group of Experts' that the Swedish and Finnish JAIC members and experts &#13;
      were very much aware, that the Estonian crew members were lying when it &#13;
      came to the most crucial parts of their evidence. Nevertheless the frequently &#13;
      changing statements of Margus Treu and Silver Linde became the essential &#13;
      evidence for the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström one week &#13;
      after the casualty. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC goes on to state:<br/><i>"Police interrogations in languages other than Swedish have been translated &#13;
      into Swedish and this Summary is based on the Swedish text."</i><br/>&#13;
      It has been described in Subchapter 36.5 that the statements of Estonian &#13;
      survivors taken in Tallinn in the Estonian or Russian languages had for &#13;
      example not been completely translated into Swedish and that therefore important &#13;
      details were missing. Therefore the summaries of the survivors' statements &#13;
      contained in the JAIC Report are to a certain part based on incomplete translations. &#13;
      It also has to be mentioned that most of the Swedish and Finnish survivors &#13;
      were questioned by policemen not trained to interrogate witnesses of marine &#13;
      casualties. Therefore most important details did not come up in the course &#13;
      of the questionings, because the relevant questions were never asked and &#13;
      thus did not become part of the JAIC investigation and cause consideration &#13;
      at all. Chapter 21 and the numerous statements by survivors as attached &#13;
      to this Report demonstrate the scarcity of the database of the JAIC Report. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      There are indications that the Estonian Commission members as well as the &#13;
      Estonian security police and other government bodies had frequently spoken &#13;
      to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. It is &#13;
      unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings &#13;
      are not available. </font></p>&#13;

      consideration of this accident. It can be said with certainty, that<br/>&#13;
      - Silver Linde had not been on the car deck on his last round;<br/>&#13;

      that the survey vessel "SUUNTA" stayed in Hangö during the 28th when the &#13;
      weather was relatively bad and the wind speed was 16/18 m/s. On the 29th &#13;
      and the 30th the wind speed was just 12 m/s, however, "SUUNTA" departed &#13;
      only on 30th at 08.40 hours from her berth to the casualty position, which &#13;
      was, of course, known by the Utö and the "MARIELLA" radar observations. &#13;
      She commenced the search at 16.27 hours and found the wreck at 17.32 hours &#13;
      on 59°22,92'N; 21°41,06'E, which is the actual wreck position. She dropped &#13;
      a buoy and returned at 18.45 hours to Hangö. <br/>&#13;
      Consequently the real position of the wreck was known to the Finnish authorities &#13;
      from the very beginning, and with certainty also to Kari Lethola. Nevertheless, &#13;
      he reported 59°23,0'N; 41°43'E by fax to Olof Forssberg on the same evening &#13;

      that the diving survey described here was not the first ordered by the Swedish &#13;
      Government. The JAIC furthermore just spends a few lines on this major operation &#13;
      carried out by very professional contractors on behalf of Sjöfartsverket. &#13;
      The evaluation of the video tapes presented to this Group of Experts show &#13;
      that this operation was conducted simultaneously with another diving investigation &#13;
      by other divers. Since it has to be excluded that this second operation &#13;
      could be carried out without the divers and the operators and supervisors &#13;
      on board of the diving support vessel "SEMI I" noting it, it has to be concluded &#13;
      that this other diving operation was also performed with the approval of &#13;
      or by Swedish governmental authorities. It is noteworthy, that no tapes &#13;
      or written documentation of this second operation have ever been released &#13;
      by the Swedish authorities to the public. They are however available. It &#13;
      has further to be mentioned that the Finns obviously tried to hide the presence &#13;
      of Tuomo Karppinen onboard - see Chapter 27 - the reason probably being &#13;
      the attempt to leave the responsibility for the many obvious mistakes made &#13;
      with Börje Stenström being the only "official" participant on behalf of &#13;
      the JAIC. <br/>&#13;
      These mistakes were:<br/>&#13;
      - the failure to instruct the divers to search the bridge properly for bodies &#13;
      and identify the bodies by means of their uniforms (or not wearing uniforms &#13;
      at all);<br/>&#13;
      - the failure to have the front bulkheads, the longitudinal bulkheads and &#13;
      the recesses on both sides of the bow ramp, the locking devices of the bow &#13;
      ramp and the ramp hooks examined properly by the divers; <br/>&#13;
      - the failure to have recovered at least the port visor hinge bolt with &#13;
      bushing, the lugs of the visor side locks and the whole bow ramp with hinges, &#13;
      just to mention the most important items;<br/>&#13;
      - the failure to have examined by the divers why the starboard stern ramp &#13;
      was open;<br/>&#13;
      - the failure to have the starboard side of the wreck above the mudline &#13;
      including the starboard stabiliser video filmed and properly recorded; <br/>&#13;
      In summary it has to be concluded that the wreck examination by the JAIC &#13;
      was carried out very poorly and insufficiently which is also reflected in &#13;
      the description of the damage to the wreck in the following chapters.</font></p>&#13;

      - the damages mentioned above, i.e. the cracked off starboard front bulkhead &#13;
      and the large holes in the longitudinal bulkheads; <br/>&#13;

      are very heavily distorted in way of the centre line.<br/>&#13;
      In summary the JAIC again indicates existing or non-existing damage the &#13;
      way it fits their casualty scenario. Missing rubber packings, cracked open &#13;
      bulkheads and distorted, cracked off girders, which obviously cannot have &#13;
      been caused during the hypothetical casualty scenario of the JAIC are either &#13;
      not mentioned or misinterpreted. <br/>&#13;
      Some details: <br/>&#13;
      - The JAIC states that the visor parking devices (harbour securing) were &#13;
      undamaged, but do not state that they were open (this means that there had &#13;
      to be "one red light" on the control panel when it was allegedly checked &#13;
      be Silver Linde - see Chapter 21.2.2.). <br/>&#13;
      - The JAIC states that "the opening in the front bulkhead on the port side &#13;
      had rather clean cut contours", which is true, however the JAIC does not &#13;
      state that the starboard front bulkhead was completely ripped open from &#13;
      the inside to the outside, that a green painted deck piece is sticking in &#13;
      the opening and that the starboard side corresponding to the photo at Fig. &#13;
      8.2 is just a big black hole of the size that the diver could crawl into &#13;
      it. <br/>&#13;
      - The mounting bracket for the locking-bolt position sensors, in short the &#13;
      sensor plate of the Atlantic lock, was found to be empty with corroded screw &#13;
      holes indicating that the sensors had been dis-connected some time before &#13;
      the casualty; <br/>&#13;
      - The sensor cables were clearly cut - not torn - all of which is not mentioned &#13;
      in the JAIC Report. Moreover the sensor plate as well as the cables had &#13;
      been cut off by the divers in December 1994 and thrown away to the sea bottom, &#13;
      thus disappeared forever, under the eyes of Stenström. There was indeed &#13;
      substantial damage to the rubber seals and flatbar housings in the "corner &#13;
      of the mouth", however not or rather limited to the forepeak deck. <br/>&#13;
      - Pounding damage was noted in way of the stempost area, but only to a very &#13;
      limited extent to the edges of the forepeak deck. <br/>&#13;
      - The bulbous bow does not only show scratch marks, but 3 partly deep indentations &#13;
      indicating very heavy contact because the bulbous bow is a very strong structure. &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> At first the JAIC describes &#13;
      the big indentation in the starboard shell plating of the visor in a misleading &#13;
      way creating the impression that it was only one indentation, although there &#13;
      are actually two, i.e. the upper part is of older and different characteristics &#13;
      and the lower larger part is extending into the older upper part as can &#13;
      be seen in Figure 8.5. The JAIC uses repeatedly the term "pounding" when &#13;
      describing the damage to the visor bottom and alleged damage to the edges &#13;
      of the forepeak deck, although the visor bottom is severely distorted and &#13;
      pressed in which occurred obviously when the visor had moved that wide forward &#13;
      that the stempost area was extending the forepeak deck and thus had lost &#13;
      its carrying function. As a result the forepeak deck was pressed into the &#13;
      visor bottom with the visible result. The only "pounding" which actually &#13;
      occurred was within the play of the locking devices. This had created the &#13;
      low banging noises heard by many passengers before the casualty on this &#13;
      voyage and also already on previous voyages. <br/>&#13;
      On pages 122/123 of the JAIC Report the visor and parts of it are shown &#13;
      on 7 photos (Figure 8.4 - 8.10) in a very particular way. <br/>&#13;
      Fig. 8.4 shows the visor looking from aft to forward and starboard to port. &#13;
      The picture shows the damage to the port inner longitudinal bulkhead and &#13;
      the deep indenta-tion on the port side of the upper cross beam. Both damages &#13;
      can be seen in more detail on Figure 8.7. What is not shown is the opposite &#13;
      port side: There is absolutely no damage, i.e. the starboard inner longitudinal &#13;
      bulkhead does not even show scratches in the paint and the port side of &#13;
      the upper crossbeam just shows paint scratches. The explanation for this &#13;
      damage being restricted to the port inside of the visor is the apparent &#13;
      fact that the vessel was considerably heeled to starboard when the lugs &#13;
      underneath the visor arms (visor lugs) broke through the front bulkheads &#13;
      of the vessel and did not support the visor any longer against moving to &#13;
      starboard. The visor fell for about 100 mm to starboard until the port inner &#13;
      bulkhead of the visor was resting on the bow ramp then lying inside the &#13;
      visor already on the vertical and crossbeams. This impact caused the up &#13;
      to 360 mm deep indentation on the port inner bulkhead of the visor. There &#13;
      is corresponding damage in way of the port upper side of the bow ramp - &#13;
      see Chapters 29, 30, 31 (Casualty Scenario). <br/>&#13;
      Figure 8.7 also shows the port inside of the ramp house with the last two &#13;
      of nine frames of the aft part of the ramp house bent. That is to say that &#13;
      actually only the last frame (P4) at port side was pressed together while &#13;
      the next one (P3) is only slightly indented, the next one (P2) even less &#13;
      and P1 just shows a slight contact mark and the remaining frames towards &#13;
      the starboard side are unaffected. See pages 955 ff. in Chapter 30. <br/>&#13;
      Figure 8.9 does not show the starboard side (outside) of the port, but of &#13;
      the starboard actuator attachment lug (visor lug) with deep scorings and &#13;
      green (deck) paint marks indicating frequent forward/aft movements of the &#13;
      visor when the visor was tilted down by different angles. The JAIC does &#13;
      not show pictures of the inside (port side) of this starboard lug and also &#13;
      not from inside and outside of the port visor lug, thereby depriving the &#13;
      reader of the possibility to draw conclusions from the conditions of these &#13;
      lug plates as to movements and tilting angles of the visor. The respective &#13;
      pictures are shown in Chapter 30 on pages 973 and 996. It reveals that both &#13;
      the outsides and insides are deeply scored at starboard side, though differently, &#13;
      i.e. much more and deeper at the outside and at the inside only one main &#13;
      scoring line almost parallel to the forecastle deck. <br/>&#13;
      At port the outside of the visor lug plates is totally unaffected, i.e. &#13;
      not even paint scorings, while the inside is very deeply scored, almost &#13;
      engraved indicating forward/aft movement of the visor at varying tilting &#13;
      angles. <br/>&#13;
      The obvious fact that the starboard outside and the port inside of the lug &#13;
      plates were most severely scored leads to the conclusion that the vessel &#13;
      was already heavily heeled to starboard when the hinges broke, first at &#13;
      starboard and subsequently at port, because the obvious fact that the port &#13;
      outer lug plate is not scored at all indicates that the vessel must have &#13;
      been heeled to starboard already quite considerably when the port hinges &#13;
      broke because there was no contact between the lug plate and the deck/deck &#13;
      beam. <br/>&#13;
      Figure 8.8 shows damage below the recess for the port locating horn which &#13;
      was obviously caused by the port locating horn at a time when the port hinges &#13;
      were broken already, because the visor was in raised condition as otherwise &#13;
      the locating horn would be resting deeper and higher in the recess as confirmed &#13;
      by the contact marks at both sides of the recess. <br/>&#13;
      Figure 8.10 shows the big visor lug being part of the Atlantic lock installation. &#13;
      It shows the bore to be elongated, but it cannot be seen that the hole lug &#13;
      is bent to starboard, it almost cracked off the visor bottom, obviously &#13;
      when the visor moved the above explained ca. 100 mm to starboard, a very &#13;
      strong indication that the Atlantic lock was at that time still intact. &#13;
      The JAIC picture also does not show the flame cut-off part of the lug with &#13;
      two deeply penetrating cracks having started in one of the burning marks. &#13;
      For details see page 1028. <br/>&#13;
      Figure 8.11 shows a rather foggy picture of the port outer bow ramp hinge &#13;
      (the JAIC has crystal clear pictures in particular from this area) which &#13;
      is again described in a misleading way. The lines allegedly point to "rags" &#13;
      are actually pointing at a thick blue mattress at the upper side and the &#13;
      bed-cloth at the right which were put there by the crew as "sealing" material &#13;
      because there was a gap of some centimetres between bow ramp and bulkhead &#13;
      in this area since the hinge had failed several months before the casualty. &#13;
      The bolt is visible in a declined condition much too far to starboard. The &#13;
      brown lug visible at the upside slipped off the bolt several months before &#13;
      the casualty where after the other one broke. The JAIC is wrong when stating &#13;
      that the aft deck plating of the visor had heavy pounding marks. Just in &#13;
      the recesses at the port and starboard side there are some contact marks, &#13;
      otherwise there are no indications of pounding in way of the deck plating.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>31. JAIC Chapter 8.5.4 &#13;
      - Ramp Damage </b>corresponds to Chapter 29.2, item 6. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC writes: <br/><i>"The condition of the ramp was inspected primarily from its lower side &#13;
      due to the limited access to the upper side." </i><br/>&#13;
      This is wrong. The ramp was accessible at the upper side as well as the &#13;
      lower side, from the inside and from the outside. The divers went everywhere &#13;
      - even inside, i.e. the car deck side - and everything is on video. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC writes:<i> "The 2 port side hinges at the bottom the ramp were &#13;
      torn apart"</i>, thereby creating the impression that this occurred during &#13;
      the casualty. This is wrong. The heavy port hinge should have been renewed &#13;
      already in January 1993 according to the specification of the last Finnish &#13;
      crew of the vessel. See Subchapters 3.4/6.5.1. This was ignored by the new &#13;
      technical managers N&amp;T and nothing was done. As time went by the bolt of &#13;
      the port outer hinge worked itself more and more to starboard, broke the &#13;
      securing plate and, finally, the outer lug connecting the ramp to the vessel &#13;
      via this hinge bolt, slipped off the bolt which caused the failure of the &#13;
      inner lug as well. The ramp was no more connected to the vessel at the port &#13;
      outside, a gap of some 20-30 mm occurred which increased. See memo about &#13;
      the discussion with Stenström in October 1995 - Enclosure 12.5.166. The &#13;
      car deck was open to the at sea always water-filled visor. According to &#13;
      Stenström the damage was frequently put on the repair list, however, repairs &#13;
      were rejected by N&amp;T. It is unknown when the port inner hinge of the bow &#13;
      ramp broke, however according to the damage picture it might well have been &#13;
      sometime before the casualty. The two starboard hinges of the bow ramp are &#13;
      just elongated. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC writes: <i>"Both hydraulic actuators for the ramp had failed in &#13;
      their piston rod end eyes, i.e. at the ramp attachments points."</i> That &#13;
      is correct, however, the starboard piston rod broke twice, once in the eye &#13;
      and another time between eye and piston. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The actuators were in partly extended position as &#13;
      when the ramp is partly open."</i> This is wrong. The starboard actuator &#13;
      is not visible at all. Its opening in way of the recess of the starboard &#13;
      front bulkhead is almost covered by the bow ramp resting on the recess and &#13;
      what is visible is torn and deformed. The JAIC fails to mention that the &#13;
      starboard landing of the bow ramp to which the attachment points were fitted &#13;
      was completely torn open (inside to outside) and severely distorted. The &#13;
      port actuator is visible inside its housing in slightly open condition. &#13;
      On one video it is completely inside the housing, on another one it is slightly &#13;
      extending to the outside - see pages 836, 837. Apparently the divers did &#13;
      change the condition of this actuator. Also inside this housing an angle &#13;
      iron is visible which obviously had been pressed into the bulkhead plating &#13;
      in way of the lower side of the opening. See Chapter 29.2 - item 6 - pages &#13;
      832, ff. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC writes that the<i> "wires preventing the ramp from falling down &#13;
      to the forepeak deck had detached from the lugs on both sides of the ramp"</i>. &#13;
      That is true, both ramp lugs are intact and without wires, which are however &#13;
      both still connected to the attachment points at the upper car deck opening. &#13;
      The starboard wire is full length visible to the intact lug with shackle &#13;
      and bolt attached. The bolt is apparently intact and screwed into the shackle &#13;
      which raises the question who did unshackle the wire from the ramp lug and &#13;
      screwed the bolt again into the shackle? Needless to say that all this is, &#13;
      of course, not mentioned in the JAIC Report. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC:<i> "The ramp port side beam was damaged in several places, mostly &#13;
      towards the top end"</i>. Meant is probably the port outer vertical girder, &#13;
      which is only slightly damaged at its bottom part between the lower and &#13;
      the next upper transverse girders. It is also possible that the JAIC means &#13;
      the damage at the port upside, outside of the ramp which was caused when &#13;
      the visor was resting on this part of the ramp. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC: <i>"The lugs for the pull-in hooks were twisted."</i> Actually &#13;
      both lugs are intact, i.e. not broken, but heavily bent away from the location &#13;
      of the pull-in hook and on the ROV video from 09.10.94 there are two wooden &#13;
      pallets visible which jammed in between the bulkhead recess and the bow &#13;
      ramp in way of the landing of the lug for the pull-in hook. On the diver &#13;
      videos from December 1994 these pallets were no more at this location, which &#13;
      means that the bow ramp must have been opened and closed. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC continues:<i> "The hooks themselves could not be inspected closely." &#13;
      </i>This is wrong. The port hook arrangement including actuator is fully &#13;
      visible on the available videos and was also checked by the diver Dave Mawston: &#13;
      <i>"There is a latching mechanism." </i>The port hook is in its initial &#13;
      position and intact which means that it cannot have been engaged before &#13;
      the casualty respectively if it was engaged upon departure Tallinn it must &#13;
      have been opened at sea before or during the casualty. The starboard hook &#13;
      is not in its initial position, where it should be is a big black hole. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The boxes on the ramp side bars, mating the bolts &#13;
      of the ramp side cleats were twisted to open position except for the lower &#13;
      port side one." </i>This is wrong: None of these mating boxes were twisted &#13;
      to open position, i.e. the port upper one was completely intact but just &#13;
      slightly bent upwards, the port lower one was completely intact with a rope &#13;
      wound around it, the starboard upper one was intact with the upside missing &#13;
      (had been burnt off upon arrival in the morning of 27 September 1994 by &#13;
      flame cutting when the crew was again unable to disengage this securing &#13;
      bolt). Obviously there had been no time to re-weld the cut off part to the &#13;
      box before the last departure. See also chapter 12.5. Finally the starboard &#13;
      lower box was completely smashed together in a way that the bolt was unable &#13;
      to enter the box. This damage was apparently caused earlier when the ramp &#13;
      had been closed when the bolt was already extended. <br/>&#13;
      In addition attention has to be drawn to the reports of diver Dave Mawston &#13;
      when checking the ramp. He found that the extended bolts at the port side &#13;
      of the ramp were about 21/2 inches = ca. 100 mm below the respective mating &#13;
      boxes, i.e. none of the port side bolts could anyway have engaged their &#13;
      mating boxes and this is apparently also the reason why the port pull-in &#13;
      hook had not engaged its mating lug. All this was obviously due to the very &#13;
      severe misalignment of the whole ramp and its disastrous consequence - nothing &#13;
      of it is mentioned by the JAIC. </font></p>&#13;

      for close investigation." </i>The locking bolt was brought up by the divers &#13;
      but thrown back into the sea by Stenström, thus it could never be<i> "closely &#13;
      investigated"</i>. Nevertheless the JAIC writes: "Only a slight variation &#13;
      in diameter was measured at the contact area between the bolt and the visor &#13;
      lug. No other damage to the bolt was noted." <br/>&#13;
      This is wrong. Although the bolt is not available for close examination &#13;
      the following can be concluded from the quite good video footage:<br/>&#13;
      - there were two contact areas indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully &#13;
      closed, sometimes only partly; <br/>&#13;
      - the vertical steel bracket fitted to the bolt was bent to port and showed &#13;
      heavy hammering marks at its edges; <br/>&#13;
      - the two lugs, between which the piston rod was connected to the bolt by &#13;
      pin, were bent outwards, i.e. away from each other, and also showed heavy &#13;
      hammering marks. <br/>&#13;
      The reason for these damages were the problems the crew had with closing &#13;
      and opening the bolt which did not function any more hydraulically since &#13;
      some months before the casualty because the lugs were severely deformed. &#13;

  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The explanations of the &#13;
      JAIC concerning the failure of the port actuator foundation, called bottom &#13;
      mounting platform, is confusing and partly wrong. The initial construction &#13;
      and the damage picture of the foundation is explained in detail and illustrated &#13;
      by several photos on pages 990 ff. of this Report. The summary reads as &#13;
      follows: <br/><i>"(1) The outer stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old &#13;
      temporary repair with very poor welding seams in its forward part. Due to &#13;
      the corrosion visible on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this &#13;
      improper repair was carried out already some considerable time before the &#13;
      casualty. <br/>&#13;
      (1) The stiffeners show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward &#13;
      and the aft ends of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonable assumed &#13;
      that the stiffeners were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. &#13;
      The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty &#13;
      due to load changes during the opening and closing of the visor. <br/>&#13;
      (2) The B-deck was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the &#13;
      stiffeners. This fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck &#13;
      remains. <br/>&#13;
      (3) The port inner stiffener was no more the original one since firstly &#13;
      it did not show any protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded &#13;
      to the deck -if at all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the &#13;
      deck by the shipyard during new-building, as it can still be seen on the &#13;
      starboard actuator foundation. <br/>&#13;
      (4) The load carrying capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably &#13;
      reduced." </i><br/>&#13;
      The JAIC explanations about the failure of the starboard actuator is accepted, &#13;
      however except for the following remarks by the JAIC: <br/><i>"The lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams showed &#13;
      indentations and scoring on the forward and starboard side faces (Figure &#13;
      8.9). The sealing arrangement around the deck openings for the actuators, &#13;
      consisting of rubber seals supported by steel flat bars, was compressed &#13;
      over most of the surface and some paint marks showed that the hinge arms &#13;
      had been in limited contact with the deck plating." </i><br/>&#13;
      The <i>"lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams" </i>were &#13;
      called <i>"actuator attachment lugs" </i>in the previous Chapter 8.5.3 and &#13;
      were actually the pair of lugs underneath the port and starboard visor arms &#13;
      (called visor deck beams by the JAIC) by means of which the actuators were &#13;
      connected to the visor. The condition of the lug plates, i.e. starboard &#13;
      outside: deeply scored, starboard inside: slightly scored: port outside: &#13;
      no contact marks at all: port inside: very deep scorings; has been explained &#13;
      and commented under Chapter 8.5.3 above and needs not be repeated. <br/>&#13;
      The JAIC is also wrong when stating that <i>"the rubber seals supported &#13;
      by steel flat bars (around the deck openings for the actuators) were compressed &#13;
      over most of the surface" </i>because this is the case only at port side &#13;
      where the rubber seals were indeed distorted apparently by rubbing. See &#13;
      pages 996 ff. The starboard side rubber seals are, however, unaffected. &#13;
      See pages 973 ff. The forward parts of the port and starboard lug plates &#13;
      show contact marks without paint at their upper parts, which were apparently &#13;
      caused when the lug plates were cutting through the forecastle deck plating. &#13;
      Below these areas there is more or less unaffected or just slightly affected &#13;
      white/red paint at starboard side all the way down, but at port side there &#13;
      are further contact areas without paint. <br/>&#13;
      Bearing in mind the strong deck beam at frame 159 which the lugs at both &#13;
      sides reached after only 120 mm of 8 mm forecastle deck plating were easily &#13;
      cut through and which was evidently cut through at both sides, it is difficult &#13;
      to believe that this was performed by the above explained foreparts of the &#13;
      two starboard and two port lugs. Calculations revealed - see Chapter 34.12 &#13;
      - that weight and forward momentum of the water-filled visor were theoretically &#13;
      able to cut the deck beam, however the damage picture of the cutting tools &#13;
      - the lug plates, and in particular, the starboard ones, do not confirm &#13;
      this. <br/>&#13;
      This problem has been closely examined by The Independent Fact Group, Stockholm, &#13;
      who more or less proved that the lugs could not have cut the deck beam, &#13;
      however, do not offer a reasonable solution but leave that to a new investigation.<br/>&#13;
      As to the starboard side the possible explanation is outlined in Chapter &#13;
      32 - Unexplained Evidence - because there are several indications that a &#13;
      powerful explosion occurred also inside the void space above B-deck, which &#13;
      blew open the front bulkhead and possibly also destroyed the deck beam in &#13;
      question before the hinges broke. <br/>&#13;
      At the port side, however, there are no such indications. Here the answer &#13;
      might be that the deck beam was cut by the piston rod of the partly extended &#13;
      actuator. The piston rod is made of high tensile steel. See Figure 8.25 &#13;
      in the JAIC Report. <br/>&#13;
      Finally the remark of the JAIC that<i> "some paint marks showed that the &#13;
      hinge arms (now the "visor deck beams" are called "hinge arms" to confuse &#13;
      the reader even more) had been in limited contact with the deck plating"</i> &#13;
      has to be totally rejected because not even the primer is affected.<br/>&#13;
      Note: This "contact" between the undersides of the visor arms and the forepeak &#13;
      deck in front of the deck openings for the actuators has been one of the &#13;
      strongest arguments in favour of the JAIC casualty scenario presented in &#13;
      the Part-Report published already early April 1995. The argumentation of &#13;
      Stenström then was that "as soon as the visor bottom was compressed deeply &#13;
      enough due to repeated up/down pounding of the visor the underside of the &#13;
      visor arms did rest on the forepeak deck and due to the leverage created &#13;
      the hinges broke". This was proven to be wrong and the above is the rest &#13;
      of this line of argumentation and even that is wrong. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Accident </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">- The car/passenger ferry &#13;
    ESTONIA sank during the early hours of 28 September 1994 in the Northern Baltic &#13;
    on its voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm. According to the official figures &#13;
    only 137 passengers and crew members survived. The wreck lies in international &#13;
    waters. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Weather / Sea state </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - At the time of the casualty &#13;
    the wind was blowing from SW-ly directions with a speed of 18-20 m/sec. The &#13;
    significant wave height was about 4 metres. Neither wind speed nor sea state &#13;
    were exceptional for the season. <br/>&#13;
    - Before the sequence-of-events of the casualty commenced the ESTONIA was &#13;
    pitching extremely hard in bow seas from port forward due to a speed which &#13;
    must be considered excessive under the prevailing conditions.</font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Ship's Condition</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - When the ferry left Tallinn &#13;
    she was unseaworthy for the following reasons: Her bow was open to the sea. &#13;
    The bow visor and the bow ramp, which should both be water(weather)tight, &#13;
    were leaking with the consequence that seawater had uncontrolled access to &#13;
    the car deck, a condition which must be avoided by all means, as it severely &#13;
    endangers the safety of the vessel and it's passengers.<br/>&#13;
    A part of the underwater hull was corroded to the extent, that seawater had &#13;
    free access to certain tanks and void spaces. The consequence of this fact &#13;
    was, that about 200 mts of unknown weights were in the vessel creating a 10 &#13;
    degrees list which could only be partly rectified by the ballasting of the &#13;
    port heeling tank.<br/>&#13;
    The vessel's Passengership Safety Certificate was false, the same is true &#13;
    for her Load Line Certificate. <br/>&#13;
    Trucks and cars on the car deck were not properly secured although the upcoming &#13;
    heavy weather was known to the master. </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Sequence-of-events </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - Due to missing rubber &#13;
    seals and damage to it's bottom the visor became quickly filled at sea up &#13;
    to the outside water level with seawater, which penetrated through the partly &#13;
    open bow ramp into the car deck.<br/>&#13;
    - The existing starboard list was increased by the wind pressure from port. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - The vessel therefore heeled 2 to 4 degrees to starboard and the water that &#13;
    had penetrated through the bow ramp accumulated on starboard aft of the car &#13;
    deck as the vessel was trimmed by the stern at the commencement of the voyage. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - There are indications that the crew opened the starboard stern ramp slightly &#13;
    in an attempt to drain the car deck thereby.<br/>&#13;
    - The bilge pumps were running and pumping from compartments of the 1st and/or &#13;
    0-decks. It has to be assumed that the watertight doors in the engine room &#13;
    area were closed, whilst the watertight doors in the passenger area of the &#13;
    1st deck were still open after the big heel.<br/>&#13;
    - At about 00.40 / 00.45 hours heavy metallic bangs were heard and felt from &#13;
    the foreship and the movements of the vessel changed to softer pitching and &#13;
    rolling. The metallic bangs continued. It has to be assumed that the starboard &#13;
    hinges and side locks of the visor failed at about this time. The visor was &#13;
    now moving forward/aft between the hinge parts on the forecastle deck and &#13;
    the deck beam at frame 159.<br/>&#13;
    - The speed was reduced and the damaged bow turned to starboard away from &#13;
    the waves, however when the vessel started to roll excessively the bow was &#13;
    turned back to port and wind and sea were now taken from straight ahead. The &#13;
    vessel now made soft, deep pitch movements for a while.<br/>&#13;
    - At some time later also the port hinges and the port side lock failed, whilst &#13;
    the Atlantic lock held somewhat longer. <br/>&#13;
    - At about 01.00 hours the vessel was shaken heavily and noises and vibrations &#13;
    as if the vessel was proceeding through ice were heard and felt by those on &#13;
    the 1st deck, shortly followed by another, even more severe impact, followed &#13;
    by a very wide heel of the vessel to starboard at 01.02 hours The vessel, &#13;
    however, came back to almost upright condition, heeled again, came back to &#13;
    10-15 degrees starboard heel and subsequently heeled in steps to about 30-35 &#13;
    degrees to starboard and stabilized in this condition for some time. <br/>&#13;
    - While the visor moved forward/aft and the lugs underneath the visor arms &#13;
    were slowly cutting trough the deck beam of frame 159, both bow ramp actuators &#13;
    broke and the unsecured ramp fell into the visor. <br/>&#13;
    - After some time the lugs underneath the visor arms had worked their way &#13;
    through the deck beam - most likely first at the port side - and the visor &#13;
    now also moved to starboard following the increasing starboard heel and fell &#13;
    onto the bow ramp which rested in the visor.<br/>&#13;
    - In the meantime the forepeak deck had penetrated the bottom structure of &#13;
    the visor whilst the shell plating edges were overlapping the forepeak deck.<br/>&#13;
    - The visor was now held by the bow ramp and by the port side plates overlapping &#13;
    the forepeak deck, whilst the vessel continued to heel to starboard and the &#13;
    stern sank deeper.</font> </p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Capsize </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- The main engines stopped &#13;
    at about 01.10 / 01.12 hours at a heel of 25-30 degrees. At this time the &#13;
    vessel had turned to a North-Easterly heading. <br/>&#13;
    - The vessel stabilized at a heel of 30-40 degrees for some time and the diesel &#13;
    generators stopped at about 01.15 / 01.20 hours whereafter the emergency generators &#13;
    started and supplied power to a limited number of consumers.<br/>&#13;
    - The vessel continued to heel and was on the side at 01.30 hours and some &#13;
    time later completely upside down whilst the stern continued to sink deeper &#13;
    and the bow to raise higher. <br/>&#13;
    - It has to be assumed that the visor did glide off the bow ramp and forepeak &#13;
    deck when the heel had reached some 130-140 degrees and sank to the bottom &#13;
    of the sea as it was unable to float. <br/>&#13;
    - The stern finally settled on the sea bottom with the bow still raised to &#13;
    about 40-45 degrees out of the water. The bow ramp was almost closed. <br/>&#13;
    - The bow sank slowly deeper and -<br/>&#13;
    at 01.53 hours the echo of the ESTONIA disappeared from the radar screen of &#13;
    the nearest vessel "MARIELLA". </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Action by the Crew</b> &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Nothing can be stated &#13;
    with some degree of probability from the bridge for the time after 00.35 hours.<br/>&#13;
    - It has to be assumed that a first "Mayday" was transmitted at around 00.45 &#13;
    hours, which for unknown reasons was not picked up. <br/>&#13;
    - It has further to be assumed that after the problems with the bow ramp and &#13;
    visor were realised, the speed was reduced and attempts were made to take &#13;
    the loads off the visor. <br/>&#13;
    - It is likely that the crew worked on the car deck attempting to hold the &#13;
    visor and the bow ramp to the vessel by different means. This attempt, however, &#13;
    failed. <br/>&#13;
    - There are also indications that the engine crew was working on the starboard &#13;
    stabiliser. All attempts of the crew were apparently abandoned at about 01.00 &#13;
    hours. <br/>&#13;
    - A warning for the passengers "Alarm, Alarm" was shouted in Estonian language &#13;
    a few times over the loudspeakers. No other information was given to the passengers. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p> </p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Technical Matters </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- At the time when the ESTONIA &#13;
    was designed and built, there were no specific design requirements for visors &#13;
    in the rules of the Classification Society Bureau Veritas. The SOLAS Convention &#13;
    at that time was not yet part of the B.V. Rules. <br/>&#13;
    - The Finnish Board of Navigation considered itself exempted from the inspection &#13;
    of structural matters in newbuildings - such as locking devices - by the Copenhagen &#13;
    Convention of 1924 and hence had to rely on authorised Classification Societies &#13;
    for plan approval and inspection of structural matters on newbuildings. B.V. &#13;
    was authorised.<br/>&#13;
    - The visor design load and the assumed load distribution on the attachments &#13;
    was in accordance with L R. Rules and the then state-of-the-art and technique.<br/>&#13;
    - The visor locking devices installed by Meyer Werft, were manufactured in &#13;
    accordance with the design and good shipbuilding practice. These devices were &#13;
    not identical to those found onboard after the casualty. <br/>&#13;
    - The SOLAS requirements for the upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
    above bulkhead deck were never complied with. Nevertheless Passenger Ship &#13;
    Safety Certificates were issued by The Finnish Board of Navigation and - after &#13;
    the vessel had changed it's flag - by B.V. on behalf of the Estonian National &#13;
    Maritime Board. It may be debated wether the issuance of these certificates &#13;
    during the time the vessel spent under Finnish flag was completely in line &#13;
    with the requirements of SOLAS but that debate is irrelevant, because any &#13;
    such failure cannot have contributed to the Catastrophe. <br/>&#13;
    - The Load Line requirements for a tight vessel were not complied with on &#13;
    9.9.1994 although BV confirmed the Load Line Certificate on this date, i.e. &#13;
    19 days before the casualty, on behalf of the Estonian National Maritime Board. &#13;
    <br/>&#13;
    - The general maintenance standard of visor and bow ramp was unacceptable &#13;
    which fact was the main cause for the casualty. </font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b> CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>1.</b> The vessel was &#13;
    designed in accordance with the state of the Art and the Rules and Regulations &#13;
    applicable at the time of design and building by one of the shipyards most &#13;
    experienced in the building of such type of ships, which had just completed &#13;
    a Near-Sister-Vessel. (See Chapters <a href="underfinnishflag.htm" target="_blank">2.1</a>, &#13;
    <a href="2.2.htm" target="_blank">2.2</a>, <a href="2.3.htm" target="_blank">2.3,</a> &#13;

    <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a> JAIC) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>2.</b> The vessel was &#13;
    constructed in accordance with the state of the Art, the approved design and &#13;
    under the supervision of a very experienced and competent Class-surveyor. &#13;
    (See Chapters <a href="2.4.2.htm" target="_blank">2.4.2,</a> <a href="2.4.3.htm" target="_blank">2.4.3,</a> &#13;
    <a href="2.4.5.htm" target="_blank">2.4.5</a>, <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">2.4.6 &#13;
    </a>and <a href="2.6.1-2.htm" target="_blank">2.6</a>. JAIC maintains, that &#13;
    the building yard did not adhere to it's own design criteria (Chapter 15 JAIC).This &#13;
    conclusion however is based on the wrong assumption, that the welding seams &#13;
    found on the wreck were laid during the construction of the vessel. (See Chapters &#13;
    <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">3.3</a>, <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, &#13;
    <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>.) &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>3.</b> The procedure chosen &#13;
    by the Finnish Board of Navigation (FBN) in the issuance of Passengership &#13;
    Safety Certificates whilst the vessel was under it's jurisdiction did not &#13;
    completely comply with the SOLAS Regulations in force at that time, but this &#13;
    failure of FBN did not contribute to the accident. (See Chapters <a href="2.4.4.htm" target="_blank">2.4.4</a> &#13;
    and <a href="6.5.2.htm" target="_blank">6.5.2</a>) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>4. </b>Whilst being owned &#13;
    and managed by her previous Finnish owners (Sally and Silja) the vessel was &#13;
    reasonably well maintained. Design or construction defects were not noted, &#13;
    although the vessel cruised for twelve years in the Baltic Sea. At the time &#13;
    of delivery of the vessel to her new Owners, she had deficiencies, which were &#13;
    however quite normal for a ship of her age and in her trade. These deficiencies &#13;
    were reported by the staff on board to Silja, the then managers of the vessel. &#13;
    This report became known to the new managers, being Nordström &amp; Thulin, who &#13;
    however chose not to take note. These deficiencies then developed fast to &#13;
    the worse and into a substantial contributing cause of the accident. (See &#13;
    Chapters <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">3.4</a> and <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5.1</a>) &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>5. </b>Acting as mandatory &#13;
    of the Estonian National Maritime Board (ENMB), Bureau Veritas on 7.2.1993 &#13;
    issued an Interim Passengership Safety Certificate for MV ESTONIA. This was &#13;
    done in obvious violation of the relevant Regulations of SOLAS. Had the responsible &#13;
    inspector of Bureau Veritas complied with his duties and refused the issuance &#13;
    of a Passengership Safety Certificate, the new Owners would have been forced &#13;
    to install the extension of the collision bulkhead above main deck and had &#13;
    this been done, the vessel would - with all probability - have survived, despite &#13;
    of all her other deficiencies. (See Chapters<a href="6.4.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    6.4</a>, <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5 </a>and 9.1)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>6.</b> At Sea the vessel &#13;
    was operated recklessly in ice and during bad weather, which caused a further &#13;
    worsening of the deficiencies taken over with the vessel and added new ones, &#13;
    the most outstanding of which was, that the visor was pushed out of its geometry, &#13;
    vibrated and was constantly filled with water to the outside water level at &#13;
    sea. No attempt was made to rectify these deficiencies. It has to be assumed, &#13;
    that the responsible staff at Nordström &amp; Thulin was aware of these further &#13;
    deficiencies as well. (See Chapters <a href="chapter12.htm" target="_blank">12.1</a> &#13;
    to <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.6,</a> <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a> &#13;
    and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>7.</b> The most crucial &#13;
    deficiency developed in 1994: The port outer hinge of the bow ramp became &#13;
    twisted, could consequently not be secured properly anymore and lost it's &#13;
    watertightness. Ever since water from the filled visor flowed into the car &#13;
    deck at sea, despite the efforts of the crew to prevent the ingress of water &#13;
    by plugging the gaps with linen and mattresses. As the watertightness of the &#13;
    bow ramp - when deemed to be the extension of the collision bulkhead above &#13;
    main deck - is a mandatory condition of SOLAS, the Rules of Bureau Veritas &#13;
    and the Load Line Convention, MV ESTONIA had lost it's class notation and &#13;
    it's seaworthiness, when being traded with an untight bow ramp. (See Chapters &#13;
    <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3</a>, <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4</a>, &#13;

    and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>)</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>8.</b> It is common knowledge &#13;
    with the Owners or Operators of Ro-Ro Passengerships, that water on the car &#13;
    deck must under any and all circumstances be avoided as it unavoidably lessens &#13;
    the stability of the vessel, being the vital safety criterion of each passengership. &#13;
    It has to be assumed, that the responsible staff at Nordström &amp; Thulin was &#13;
    aware of the loss of watertightness of the bow ramp and the consequential &#13;
    ingress of water onto the car deck from the water-filled visor. No attempt &#13;
    was made however to rectify this unacceptable condition. (See Chapter <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>) &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>9.</b> It should have &#13;
    been detected at least by those whose duty it was, to control safe operation &#13;
    of Passengerships trading between Estonia and Sweden for the benefit of their &#13;
    passengers. This refers especially to the inspections conducted by the inspector &#13;
    of Bureau Veritas - also acting as mandatory of ENMB - shortly before the &#13;
    casualty and - especially - the inspection of MV ESTONIA on the day before &#13;
    the casualty by leading personnel of Sjöfartsinspectionen (SHIPINSPEC) and &#13;
    ENMB. During this inspection the most serious deficiencies at the bow area &#13;
    were found and noted, but - although the vessel could have been stopped by &#13;
    order of the Estonian members of ENMB in Tallinn or by refusal to permit entry &#13;
    into Swedish waters or ports through the leading personnel of Sjöfartsverket &#13;
    - nothing was done. (See Chapters<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> 9.1</a>,<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;

    </a>and <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>) </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>10. </b>There were further &#13;
    grave deficiencies in the vessel, when she left for her last voyage:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> I. Due to fatigue cracks &#13;
      caused by the vibrations of the visor and unqualified repair work the hinges &#13;
      of the visor had lost nearly all of their design strength. (See Chapters &#13;
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a>, &#13;

      </a>and <a href="34.9.htm" target="_blank">34.9</a>) <br/>&#13;
      II. The stempost of the visor had been cracked four times due to fatigue &#13;
      caused by the vibration of the visor. Consequently it could not support &#13;
      the weight of the visor anymore. The visor did instead rest on the forepeak &#13;
      deck which fact caused misalignment of the visor and all its locking- and &#13;
      holding devices far exceeding the permissible tolerances. (See Chapters &#13;
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      III. The vessel left port with a starboard list, which was caused by uncontrolled &#13;
      water ingress into the vessel through a hole in the shell plating. (See &#13;
      Chapter <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.1</a>) The cargo in the &#13;
      vessel was not lashed according to regulations despite knowledge of vessel's &#13;
      command of the coming heavy weather. (See Chapters <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.2</a>, &#13;
      <a href="chapter18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>) </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>11.</b> The grave deficiencies &#13;
    described in 5, 7 and 10 above rendered the vessel unseaworthy. When she left &#13;
    the port of Tallinn, she was not permitted to carry passengers, cargo or crew &#13;
    under all relevant international or Estonian national regulations. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>12.</b> The vessel was &#13;
    run on full engine power in very rough seas up and until the casualty. This &#13;
    fact constitutes a gross violation of the principles of good seamanship and &#13;
    shows disrespect for the comfort of the passengers. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) &#13;
    Had the vessel been in a seaworthy condition however, such facts would not &#13;
    have mattered, as they did not over the past 14,5 years of her trade in the &#13;
    Baltic Sea. Under conditions as given on the night of the 28th of September &#13;
    1994 this excessive speed started the known deficiencies to interlink and &#13;
    thereby the chain of causes to unravel which led irreversibly to the foundering &#13;
    of MV ESTONIA.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>13. </b>This 'Group of &#13;
    Experts' has used all efforts and possibilities available to it to investigate &#13;

    by it. (See Chapters <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a> and <a href="chapter21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>) &#13;
    Substantial evidence unknown so far was collected. (See Chapters <a href="chapter22.htm" target="_blank">22</a> &#13;
    to <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) The Group purposely refrained &#13;
    from taking refuge to hypothetical assumptions in it's attempt to establish &#13;
    the casualty scenario but rather made it their point to seek the truth based &#13;
    on facts only. Only evidence confirmed by other facts was considered permissible &#13;
    evidence in the establishment of the casualty scenario by this 'Group of Experts'. &#13;
    The result of these efforts is the casualty scenario described in Chapter &#13;
    31. It demonstrates that the vessel was already in a crucial situation, which &#13;
    should have prompted immediate return at 20.45 hours at which time it was &#13;
    still under coastal shelter. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) &#13;
    That occasion having been missed the vessel was doomed to death as the water &#13;
    ingress into the car deck constantly increased until it finally became overwhelming.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>14. </b>When scrutinizing &#13;
    the underwater videos made available to this 'Group of Experts' by JAIC astonishing &#13;
    facts were discovered. Although these facts do not contribute to the task &#13;
    of the Group, the most important of them shall be reported here briefly: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">I. The underside of the &#13;
      port bridge wing had apparently been torn open, when the vessel was already &#13;
      resting on the seabed. (See Chapters <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> &#13;
      and<a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank"> 34.6</a>) <br/>&#13;
      II. Divers of the "official" teams took time to search for, find and salvage &#13;
      a certain suitcase belonging to a gentleman with the reputation of being &#13;
      engaged in the smuggling of weapons. (Chapter<a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
      27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br/>&#13;
      III. There is evidence, that there has been movement of the bow ramp, when &#13;
      the vessel was already resting on the seabed. (See Chapter <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br/>&#13;
      IV. There is evidence, that other than the "official" diving teams were &#13;
      in the vessel, especially in the car deck. (See Chapters <a href="chapter25.htm" target="_blank">25.1</a>, &#13;
      <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)It &#13;
      has to be assumed that the other divers had entered the wreck with the knowledge &#13;
      and permission of Swedish Government Authorities. No records of their activities &#13;
      are available. </font></p>&#13;
  </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">After thorough investigation &#13;
    of some of the underwater videos a world renowned expert came to the conclusion, &#13;
    that explosions had occurred on MV ESTONIA's bow. (See Chapters <a href="chapter32.htm" target="_blank">32.1</a>, &#13;
    <a href="chapter7.htm" target="_blank">7</a> and<a href="34.7.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    34.7.1</a>) These conclusions have not been taken into consideration when &#13;
    establishing the casualty scenario. The sole reason was, that these conclusions &#13;
    have to be seen in conjunction with the repeated reports about a "big hole &#13;
    on the starboard side" (See Chapter <a href="chapter36.htm" target="_blank">36.3</a>). &#13;
    Whether there were explosions can only be established with certainty by metallurgical &#13;
    examination of the metal affected from the wreck and whether there actually &#13;
    is a big hole on the starboard side can only - but easily - be established &#13;
    with certainty, if and when the Swedish authorities release the underwater &#13;
    video tapes taken of the wreck by different diving teams in their original &#13;
    version i.e. without any tapering therewith. Only after such further investigations &#13;
    have been held, is it possible for anybody to establish the true causes for &#13;
    the foundering of MV ESTONIA. </font></p>&#13;

    FROM THE BALTIC PHENOMENON</b></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The attached &#13;
    report - made up by ADC Support AB, Stockholm on request of the JAIC - contains &#13;
    a historical overview of the ferry traffic between Finland and Sweden with &#13;
    the rapidly growing number of passengers as well as of cars/trucks and the &#13;
    rapidly growing ferries. </font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The VIKING SALLY, &#13;
    designed and constructed to cope with this fast development - called "The &#13;
    Baltic Phenomenon" - was considered the trend-setter when she took up service &#13;
    in the early 1980's with Viking Line. The effect of competition between the &#13;
    two main operators in these trades, i.e. Silja and Viking, on the design and &#13;
    construction of the ever growing ferries, and even on the safety philosophy &#13;
    of the two operators, is clearly outlined. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the development &#13;
    between 1959 and 1993 of the visor with ramp house construction - called "garage" &#13;
    in the report - in comparison to other visor constructions and bow doors on &#13;
    Silja and Viking Line ferries was examined in the report. The result is that &#13;
    Silja commissioned 25 ferries during these 34 years, of which 7 were fitted &#13;
    with a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the FINLANDIA and &#13;
    SILJA REGINA commissioned in 1981. Viking Line did bring 41 ferries into service, &#13;
    of which 27 had a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the OLYMPIA &#13;
    in 1986 (sailing in P&amp;O charter as PRIDE OF BILBAO between Southampton and &#13;
    Bilbao/Spain since her sale) and ALANDFÅRJAN in 1987. This demonstrates that &#13;
    it was absolutely common in those years, and in conformity with the state-of-the-art, &#13;
    to apply this construction - bow ramp extending into a ramp house which was &#13;
    part of the visor. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report further &#13;
    discusses the safety culture existing for decades within the Silja and Viking &#13;
    organisations and on the basis of which the "ships" navigation and operation &#13;
    at sea was not considered to be a main "risk factor" as the long-term experience &#13;
    had proved. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The collective record &#13;
    of Silja and Viking Lines from 1960 to 1995 is five killed passengers on 107 &#13;
    million passenger single trips, i.e. one casualty per almost 18 million single &#13;
    trips. Moreover, these 5 passengers were killed in one collision in a narrow &#13;
    fairway. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to ESTONIA's crew &#13;
    recruited exclusively from ESCO staff, the author indicates by means of comparison &#13;
    between the power/breadth ratios of the Silja/Viking ferries in 1993, which &#13;
    was between 700-1000 kW/m and the ESCO vessels at the same time, which was &#13;
    between 100-300 kW/m except for GEORG OTTS being 600 kW/m, that the ESTONIA &#13;
    crew might not have had sufficient experience to handle the vessel competently.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report has been &#13;
    prepared by the Naval Architect Hans Wermelin, thus from the point of view &#13;
    of a naval architect based on his knowledge at the end of 1995.Consequently &#13;
    it ends with the following remarks:</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »This overview with &#13;
    the explanations of the work with safety is contrasting to the Estonia catastrophe. &#13;
    The reason is that until this happened the design philosophy was that big &#13;
    volumes of water should not enter into cargo deck when the ship was properly &#13;
    closed at sea. When the catastrophe showed this was a false philosophy an &#13;
    intensive work started to make these ships safe regardless of water on cargo &#13;
    deck. In fact this work was already started after the catastrophe with the &#13;
    Herald of Free Enterprise. Thus the latest purposely built ships in the trade &#13;
    manage to carry a lot of water on the cargo deck: M/S Silja Symphony and M/S &#13;
    Silja Serenade manage one meter and M/S Silja Europa has to sink before she &#13;
    capsizes.«</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</b> &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nordström &amp; Thulin &#13;
    AB is a Stockholm-based public company, established in 1850, with extensive &#13;
    experience in the worldwide operation of large modern tankers and bulk carriers. &#13;
    Also passenger ferry operations between the Swedish mainland and the island &#13;
    of Gotland in the Baltic Sea belonged to the business and shipbroking is another &#13;
    important company activity.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of &#13;
    the changes in the Soviet Union in 1988 the Board of Nordström &amp; Thulin (N&amp;T) &#13;
    decided to investigate the possibilities for a car/ passenger service between &#13;
    Stockholm and Tallinn and in early spring 1989 Hans Laidwa, a born Estonian, &#13;
    took up his work.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Laidwa's business &#13;
    was to investigate the possibilities of opening a ferry traffic between Stockholm &#13;
    and Tallinn. N&amp;T's plans had a positive response in Stockholm and Tallinn, &#13;
    but the decisions - as far as Estonia was concerned - at that time were still &#13;
    being made in Moscow. The Soviet authorities would among other things have &#13;
    to tolerate that passengers on short cruises to Tallinn would not need visas, &#13;
    which was finally accepted.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&amp;T received the &#13;
    exclusive right for the passenger traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm from &#13;
    the Estonian side for a guaranteed period of 10 years. This was necessary &#13;
    for the long-term planning of investments, because N&amp;T had to take care of &#13;
    all investments in vessels, in terminals and project preparations and also &#13;
    to conduct the ferry line with own personnel.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For the new activities &#13;
    N&amp;T formed the company N&amp;T Estline AB, and appointed Hans Laidwa its managing &#13;
    director. The Danish passenger ferry MV DANA REGINA, which for many years &#13;
    had been employed in the traffic between Copenhagen and Oslo, was purchased, &#13;
    renamed NORD ESTONIA and put under Swedish flag. The ferry left Stockholm &#13;
    on 16 June 1990 on her historical first tour and a very euphoric summer was &#13;
    commenced. The picture of the city of Tallinn was changing and many of the &#13;
    Soviet restrictions were breaking down through the influence of the numerous &#13;
    tourists visiting the city. The first song festival after 50 years took place &#13;
    without approval from Moscow and it was the first time in 50 years that people &#13;
    from all over Estonia could meet friends and relatives from other parts of &#13;
    the country.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the summer &#13;
    of 1990 a difficult time began, and with the darkness and cold of winter came &#13;
    harder political signals which culminated in the bloody events in Vilnius &#13;
    and Riga in January 1991 and also the Estonians were prepared to build barricades &#13;
    and to fight for their independence. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To this dark picture &#13;
    also contributed the murder of two Swedish union leaders in Tallinn. MV NORD &#13;
    ESTONIA was more or less sailing empty during the winter and spring of 1991, &#13;
    a situation which only gradually changed in the less than 2 years that the &#13;
    NORD ESTONIA would remain in this service. </font></p>&#13;

        not unusual. In the shipping business it is more the rule than the exception &#13;
        that part of owners' employees are engaged from ship management companies. &#13;

      1992 the formalities to buy the WASA KING ex VIKING SALLY were finalised &#13;
      and the decision made, to operate the vessel under Estonian flag with Estonian &#13;
      crew. Since the Estonian Ships Register was not accepted by the mortgagee &#13;
      banks, the vessel had to be registered with one of the acknowledged Ships &#13;
      Registers and Cyprus was selected. To permit an additional entry in the &#13;
      Estonian Bareboat Register - condition to fly the Estonian flag and to employ &#13;
      Estonian crew - the structure of owning/operating/ managing companies as &#13;
      below stated was created.</font></p>&#13;

  <div align="left">&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> MV ESTONIA was &#13;
      owned by the Cyprus company Estline Marine Company Ltd. The shares of this &#13;
      company were owned 50% by Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) and 50% by Nordthulin &#13;
      Luxembourg S.A., which is a wholly owned daughter company of Nordström &amp; &#13;
      Thulin AB (N&amp;T), Stockholm, whilst ESCO was owned by the Estonian Government. &#13;
      The vessel was registered in Cyprus with permission for parallel registry &#13;
      in Estonia on the basis of a bareboat charter party. </font></p>&#13;
  </div>&#13;
  <div align="left">&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason for &#13;
      the vessel being registered in Cyprus was - as said before - the demand &#13;
      of the mortgagee, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), &#13;
      that the vessel had to be entered in a register with mortgage security acceptable &#13;
      to the bank, which was not the case with the Estonian register. </font></p>&#13;
  </div>&#13;
  <div align="left">&#13;

      E-Line contracted ESCO on the basis of a Ship Management Contract to provide &#13;
      the crews and to take care of technical maintenance/operations as well as &#13;
      insurance. The reason for this was that ESCO was a Tallinn based, state-owned &#13;
      stock company. Its history dates back to 1879, when the first shipping company &#13;
      Linda was established in Estonia. ESCO operated worldwide a variety of cargo &#13;
      vessels of up to 50,000 dwt. ESCO also operated passenger ferries in the &#13;
      Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Finland. In the autumn of 1994 the company &#13;
      owned and operated 55 vessels and thus had considerable better possibilities &#13;
      than E-Line in dealing with crew matters, such as employment, quality control, &#13;
      education/training and follow-up.</font></p>&#13;

  <div align="left">&#13;

      part left the technical maintenance/operation on the basis of a respective &#13;

      of larger passenger ferries than ESCO and also having better connections &#13;
      to suppliers of equipment and spare parts, etc. Also insurance matters and &#13;
      administration were left to N&amp;T having more experience than ESCO with the &#13;
      international insurance of vessels. </font></p>&#13;

  <div align="left">&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On basis of an &#13;

  <div align="left">&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Estonian National &#13;
      Maritime Board (E.N.M.B) was only established after Estonia's independence &#13;
      in 1991 and thus had no experienced inspectors to carry out the safety inspections &#13;
      on large and complicated vessels which were required from the flag state &#13;
      by SOLAS. It was apparently for this reason that B.V. was asked whether &#13;
      they would be prepared to perform, in addition to their obligations as Classification &#13;
      Society, the safety inspections. B.V. obviously agreed and a respective &#13;
      contract was signed already on 18 August 1992, a copy of which is attached &#13;
      as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.2.114.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.2.114.</a> &#13;
      Another contract was agreed and signed by B.V. and N&amp;T which dealt apparently &#13;
      with activities in addition to the normal relationship between owner respectively &#13;
      technical manager and the Classification Society. This contract is in the &#13;
      files of the JAIC and remains classified even after the publication of the &#13;
      Final Report. It is only known that the parties to the contract have agreed &#13;
      to refer disputes to London Arbitration.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the &#13;
      then head of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm inspection office, Ulf Beijner, &#13;
      however, also B.V. was uncertain about the requirements to be performed &#13;
      by the Maritime Administration of the new flag state in case of a large &#13;
      and almost 13 year old car/passenger ferry like ESTONIA. Therefore Sjöfartsverket &#13;
      was asked to render assistance during the take-over inspections at Turku &#13;
      and Tallinn, perform the "operative control" and whatever else might be &#13;
      required as a consequence of the flag change.</font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It will be explained &#13;
      in the subsequent subchapter that Sjöfartsverket complied with this request &#13;
      against respective payments and a rather close co-operation between the &#13;
      otherwise totally different organisations N&amp;T, B.V./ E.N.M.B and Sjöfartsverket &#13;
      in connection with the take-over and flag change of the ESTONIA commenced. &#13;

      and chief officers had experience with passenger ferries / Ro-Ro traffic.<br/>&#13;
      M.V. ESTONIA was taken over from her previous owners at the shipyard in &#13;
      Turku, there the Estonian crew took possession of the vessel, the on board &#13;
      organisation was established and the necessary work to adjust the vessel &#13;
      to Estline's traffic was carried out. Finnish speaking personnel from the &#13;
      previous owners Wasa Line (chief officer, 1st engineer, electrician, and &#13;
      2 repairmen) were hired from the start of the new traffic for between 21/2 &#13;
      and 5 months to assist their Estonian successors with practical advice in &#13;
      dealing with the vessel's specific systems. This principle was always followed &#13;
      by the Operations Organisation of N&amp;T when taking over vessels, independently &#13;
      of flag or nationality of crew. <br/>&#13;
      One of N&amp;T's ferry-experienced masters, Anders Andersson, assisted N&amp;T's &#13;
      organisation in preparation work for about 2 months before the vessel was &#13;
      taken over and stayed on board the vessel for the first 51/2 months. His &#13;
      main task was to give practical advice to the Estonian master in respect &#13;
      of navigation in the Stockholm archipelago and manoeuvring in port, but &#13;
      also in respect of cargo and stowage planning, and other traffic related &#13;
      questions.« </font></i></p>&#13;

    from Nordström &amp; Thulin, Ulf Hobro, was interviewed by the criminal police &#13;

      had worked on board vessels routed between Tallinn and Helsinki. <b>The &#13;

    for the education, selection and training of the crew must have - at least &#13;
    externally - a good opinion of those whom they have selected, which, however, &#13;
    is by no means shared by all the insiders. Actually Captain Andresson had &#13;
    been master onboard GEORG OTTS for 8 months, chief officer for 10 months and &#13;
    2nd officer for 10 months, i.e. in total 28 months. Bearing in mind that two &#13;
    crews relieved each other every 2 weeks, the time onboard is only 50%, i.e. &#13;
    14 months and certainly not many years, as Hobro told the police.</font></p>&#13;

    and the atmosphere on board during the first months in service can probably &#13;
    best be demonstrated by an extract from the book <b>"Katastrofen Kurs"</b> &#13;
    by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg. Anders Hellberg, who spoke in length &#13;
    with Anders Andersson, reports as a result of this discussion in Chapter 11 &#13;
    of the book:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Arrogant, nonchalant &#13;
      and not very competent <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arvo &#13;
      Andresson, Master of "Estonia", was in many respects an extraordinary master. &#13;
      He took care that discipline and order on board were properly upheld. However, &#13;
      he had a little problem: He mixed up port and starboard. He, as well as &#13;
      his relief Avo Piht, were described as little Gods on board. Under the old &#13;
      Russian system, of which practically the entire crew was a product, the &#13;
      master's word or orders were never questioned. In particular during his &#13;
      absence this could become quite serious. On board a vessel certain things &#13;
      have to be carried out immediately in order not to endanger the safety. &#13;
      But if the master was not present and could not be asked, the result could &#13;
      be that nothing at all was done. It was better to do nothing instead of &#13;
      doing something which could cause the master to see red. Such a system certainly &#13;
      has its advantages, if the master is fully competent. But was Captain Arvo &#13;
      Andresson fully competent? This is questioned by someone who has worked &#13;
      with Andresson.<br/>&#13;
      When the Estonian Shipping Company ESCO took over "Estonia" the Swedish &#13;
      part owner of Estline, N&amp;T, employed a number of advisers, actually assistant &#13;
      masters and crew members working in other functions, who were to train and &#13;
      control the Estonian crew members to make sure that they really knew what &#13;
      they were doing.<br/>&#13;
      Initially N&amp;T wanted to have a Swedish master, chief officer and chief engineer &#13;
      for the vessel, although sailing under Estonian flag, however, ESCO refused &#13;
      to accept that. Instead, the Swedish "advisers" were employed. <br/>&#13;
      One of the Swedish assistant masters, Anders Andersson, worked for quite &#13;
      some time with Arvo Andresson. He has described the Estonian master to the &#13;
      Joint Accident Investigation Commission as having been arrogant and nonchalant, &#13;
      and having strictly upheld discipline and the hierarchy on board. He pursued &#13;
      this so rigorously that he even changed the crew in the hotel and restaurant &#13;
      sections, even if the results were catastrophic. The Swedish and Finnish &#13;
      advisers were professionals from Viking, Silja, and Estline's previous vessel &#13;
      "Nord Estonia" in respective positions on board, such as hotel, restaurants, &#13;
      tax free and business shops. This worked very well and effectively until &#13;
      Arvo Andresson changed everything and put incompetent Estonian personnel &#13;
      into management positions, no matter what effect that had on the business &#13;
      results. <br/>&#13;
      All this was reported to Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Manager of N&amp;T, &#13;
      who spoke to Arvo Andresson requesting him not to interfere with matters &#13;
      which he did not understand. To discuss these things with ESCO "was totally &#13;
      useless as they under all circumstances strengthened the position of Arvo &#13;
      Andresson. He had an untouchable position within ESCO".<br/>&#13;
      When "Estonia" was taken over and Andersson and Andresson met for the first &#13;
      time, Andersson asked Arvo Andresson how he managed the change from "Georg &#13;
      Otts" to "Estonia" and Arvo Andresson just replied "vessel is vessel". This &#13;
      explains a lot about Arvo Andresson because 9 months on the "Georg Otts", &#13;
      a small ferry without much windage sailing between Helsinki and Tallinn, &#13;
      can naturally in no way be a proper preparation for taking over the command &#13;
      of a ferry like "Estonia" with a substantially larger windage and other &#13;
      relevant differences. As a confirmation, the vessel grounded near Sandhamn &#13;
      soon after the service had been opened, because Arvo Andresson had totally &#13;
      underestimated the drifting speed. <br/>&#13;
      All vessels which regularly call at Stockholm have a wind restriction for &#13;
      the passing of Farfarsgrundet (Sandhamn). The large Silja and Viking ferries &#13;
      do not enter here if the wind speed is in excess of 15 m/sec. from S/SW, &#13;
      then they use the northern entrance (Söderarm). For the considerably smaller &#13;
      "Estonia" the senior pilot of Stockholm had set the limit to 10 m/sec. <br/>&#13;
      The experience of Arvo Andresson in ferry traffic was restricted to the &#13;
      Helsinki-Tallinn service. There are 3 smaller ferries: "Georg Otts", "Vaana &#13;
      Tallinn" and "Tallink" which go daily both ways. Reportedly these relatively &#13;
      small vessels always used tugs.<br/>&#13;
      "Estonia" had the highest ice class and 24000 hp, whilst "Georg Otts" was &#13;
      so low powered that they always had to run the engines at full speed against &#13;
      heavy seas or ice in order to make some headway at all. To proceed with &#13;
      "Estonia" against heavy head seas, however, required a lot of experience &#13;
      as otherwise quite some damage could be done to the foreship with such powerful &#13;
      engines. This experience Arvo Andresson did not have. This became obvious &#13;
      rather quickly after the take-over at Turku, when "Estonia" departed and &#13;
      he misjudged the wind completely and used the propellers the wrong way so &#13;
      that the vessel almost hit the quay. Subsequently he admitted to Andersson &#13;
      that he had difficulties with manoeuvring the engines and also mixed up &#13;
      port and starboard.<br/>&#13;
      Similar incidents happened frequently during the following months. <br/>&#13;
      According to the Swedish captain the Estonians also never did learn how &#13;
      to properly load the "Estonia". It is important to load a Ro-Ro vessel correctly, &#13;
      both in order to obtain the correct trim in the ballast tanks considering &#13;
      the wind and in order to prevent the vessel from heeling.<br/>&#13;
      The mates were sitting all afternoon with their cargo plan, only to discover &#13;
      that it did not function when the cars were rolling on board. There were &#13;
      always significant changes in the bookings at the last minute. Then emergency &#13;
      solutions had to be found in order to take all cars on board. Simultaneously, &#13;
      there was an aversion within ESCO against the Swedish interfering on board. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      As master, Arvo Andresson was dominant and authoritarian. The mates never &#13;
      dared even to come close to the sticks (Note: pitch controls), not even &#13;
      the chief officer who normally has to be able to manoeuvre the vessel. Andresson &#13;
      was a product of the Soviet system. Once when he damaged the quay at Frihamn &#13;
      in Stockholm with the aft of the vessel, he did not accept to write a report &#13;
      to the ship owners. "I will be able to persuade my mates to testify that &#13;
      the damages to the quay were already existing when we arrived", he said. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      The Swedish captain describes the difference between an Estonian and a Swedish &#13;
      or Finnish vessel as follows: "On a Swedish ferry the mate first reduces &#13;
      the speed and does thereafter inform the master about what he has done. &#13;
      As regards "Estonia", it was the other way round."<br/>&#13;
      Generally, there was a poor ability to take initiatives within the crew, &#13;
      probably as a result of the old system. Nobody dared to take his own initiative.« &#13;

    the ESTONIA radio operator was not mentioned in the safety role and thus had &#13;
    no function in case of emergency.</font></li>&#13;

    of occurrences with drunken Estonian crew members; in the crew's dayroom it &#13;
    was almost always party time on the last trip to Stockholm before the relief &#13;
    crew would take over on the following day (also on the last voyage).</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There were lots &#13;
    of problems with Arvo Andresson who was absolutely unsuitable for passenger &#13;
    vessels; everything was much easier with Avo Piht, who already had experience &#13;
    with Baltic ferries.</font></li>&#13;
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andresson also &#13;
    had a problem taking decisions by himself since he was always used to having &#13;
    somebody above him. This became drastically obvious in stress situations when &#13;
    quick decisions had to be made. Typical were two occurrences, viz:</font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a)</b> A passenger &#13;
    sustained a heart attack at sea and Andresson was totally helpless, did not &#13;

    what he should do.</font></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Very often relatives &#13;
    of the crew members simply stayed on board in Tallinn for the whole round-trip &#13;
    without being registered and without Arvo Andresson doing anything against &#13;
    it although he knew of it. It was easy for non-crew members to get on board. &#13;

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Marlene Andersson &#13;
    as well as Arvo Andresson respectively Avo Piht attended the Estline board &#13;
    meetings when they took place on the ESTONIA. Frequently there was an irritated, &#13;
    stressed atmosphere. There were also language problems. The Swedes and Estonians &#13;
    were sometimes shouting at each other. Also Peter Barasinski, an ex restaurant &#13;
    chef on the ESTONIA, has reported that he had been told by his wife Carita, &#13;
    who was a conference hostess on ESTONIA (did not survive), that during the &#13;
    meetings of the Estline Board of Directors, which were held on board the ESTONIA, &#13;
    there had always been clashes and that the N&amp;T and ESCO representatives had &#13;
    shouted at each other in loud voices and with red faces, and that this had &#13;
    been so up to the end.</font></li>&#13;
</ul><blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for Arvo &#13;
    Andresson seen with the eyes of Anders Andersson and his wife. Some of this &#13;
    is confirmed by the Finnish advisers who have told this 'Group of Experts' &#13;
    that it always took unusually long for Andresson to get the vessel alongside &#13;
    and that the berthing manoeuvres were quite often accompanied by impacts. &#13;
    They also recounted that during the first real heavy weather voyage from Tallinn &#13;
    to Stockholm Anders Andersson decided to enter the archipelago at Utö and &#13;
    proceed inside up to Söderarm for the safety and comfort of passengers and &#13;
    crew and, last but not least, the vessel. Reportedly this also led to a major &#13;
    clash with Andresson and ESCO although no time was lost, and, because there &#13;
    was absolutely no support from N&amp;T, was never repeated by Andersson. The Finnish &#13;
    advisers have also stated that at the beginning when the vessel was proceeding &#13;
    too fast against head seas passengers complained to the Information desk, &#13;
    whereafter the girls phoned the bridge and passed on the complaints, but were &#13;
    harshly brushed off and never dared to do it again. (For more details about &#13;

    with ten motor-driven lifeboats of open type and of fibre-glass construction. &#13;
    The first boat on the starboard side - lifeboat no. 1 - was a man overboard &#13;
    (MOB) rescue boat, i.e. the emergency boat. Two boats were equipped with searchlights. &#13;
    The boats were suspended under davits on deck 8. Embarkation was from deck &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ship had an alarm &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system &#13;
    was function tested once a week. The audibility of the system against the &#13;

    although no documented measurements had been made.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarms were installed &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system &#13;
    operated on the 220 V system and was connected to the main- and emergency &#13;
    generator systems. The alarm system was not powered by the emergency batteries.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarm buttons were &#13;
    installed on every deck, including the sections and work rooms of the crew. &#13;
    By pressing an alarm button an audible signal was triggered off on the navigation &#13;
    bridge and an indicator showed which section the alarm was coming from. In &#13;
    case of no reaction within 30 seconds, the alarm in the entire vessel was &#13;
    automatically activated. The receipt of one signal on the bridge did not prevent &#13;
    the receipt of additional signals from other alarm buttons.</font></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Bureau Veritas &#13;
    inspected the vessel for compliance with the class requirements in accordance &#13;
    with their rules and standards. The main inspection period was five years &#13;
    and the 1500 items to be inspected were divided into approximately 300 items &#13;
    to be inspected each year according to the Continuous Survey Programme of &#13;
    Bureau Veritas. The bow area under this programme was inspected in 1983, 1988 &#13;
    and in 1993. No discrepancies were recorded during any of these inspections. &#13;
    The question remains why the severe deficiencies of the visor and the bow &#13;
    ramp which clearly existed already in 1993 were not recorded. </font></font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the available &#13;
    documentation it has to be assumed that the two B.V. people responsible for &#13;
    the ESTONIA, both from a classification and statutory point of view, Hans &#13;
    Olsson, manager of BV-Sweden, and Anders Wirstam, staff surveyor of the BV-Stockholm &#13;
    office and exclusively involved with ESTONIA, were not interrogated by Joint &#13;
    Accident Investigation Commission and there is no recorded evidence in the &#13;
    files of the Swedish part of this Commission about their interrogations by &#13;
    the police and the prosecutor. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In a memo found in &#13;
    the files of the prosecutor the following is, however, stated: </font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On 12.10.1994 &#13;
      at 12.10 hours I had contact with the manager of B.V. in Gothenburg, Hans &#13;
      Olsson, Tel. (031) 17 14 15. <br/></i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The &#13;
      subject was which surveys they had done on the "Estonia". All the relevant &#13;
      documentation was with them; Olsson stated that he could not submit any &#13;
      documents without the respective authority. In case he should have to do &#13;
      so, he would need the approval partly from N&amp;T, partly from the Estonian &#13;
      Government.<br/>&#13;
      Olsson even wishes to inform the lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson by telephone &#13;
      (08) 665 90 70. This lawyer protects them legally. <br/>&#13;
      Olsson also advised that Olof Forssberg from the Commission had already &#13;
      given the same explanation as the police now give. Forssberg raised the &#13;
      same questions which the police are now asking. Olsson knew that Forssberg &#13;
      had been in contact with the owners in this matter, N&amp;T had been in contact &#13;
      with Olsson and they will send a letter with what Forssberg wants to know. &#13;
      <br/>&#13;
      The documentation concerning "Estonia" consists of a large number of A4 &#13;
      folders. <br/>&#13;
      Olsson requires a written statement from the police with the documents they &#13;
      are demanding. Before this the police have to contact N&amp;T - S.M. (Sven Malmroos).<br/>&#13;
      In the course of the further development I managed to contact sometimes &#13;
      the prosecutor and sometimes Forssberg.<br/>&#13;
      Some co-ordination has to be found. / S.M. (Sven Malmroos).«</font></i></p>&#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that &#13;
    B.V. apparently enjoyed some special treatment as did N&amp;T and ESCO, which &#13;
    continued throughout the investigation up-to-date. Reportedly Hans Olsson &#13;
    left B.V. in the summer of 1998 and might thus be willing to give some explanations &#13;
    now.</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The files of the &#13;
    prosecutor reveal that Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam were interrogated together &#13;

    and S.A. Wranding. On 02.06.1997 Hans Olsson was questioned alone by the criminal &#13;

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The situation as &#13;
    to the allegedly performed Port State Control (PSC) inspection is confusing:</font></p>&#13;
  <blockquote> &#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) According &#13;
      to a memo by Sven Malmroos, investigating police inspector during the early &#13;
      days, he was advised on 12.10.1994 by Eva Lindström from the Sjöfartsverket &#13;
      head office that two operative controls had been carried out by them, one &#13;
      at the beginning of 1993 (during take-over) and another one at the beginning &#13;
      of 1994, which is unknown unless they mean the RITS exercise on 01.02.1994, &#13;
      which was actually a bomb exercise and not an operative control. The memo &#13;
      of Sven Malmroos is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.3.137.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
      Enclosure 9.3.137.</a></font></p>&#13;
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) According &#13;
      to the JAIC there had been four inspections: the take-over inspection, which &#13;
      had to be considered a Port State Control (PSC) inspection, - see Subchapter &#13;
      6.5.2 - and three further PSC inspections during the following 20 months. &#13;
      One was supposed to have been carried out in connection with an oil spill &#13;
      caused by leaking stern-tube seals already in April 1993, another one was &#13;
      supposed to have been in December 1993 and the final one was said to have &#13;
      been in March 1994 which allegedly did not give rise to any remark. See &#13;
      the JAIC Report - Subchapter 3.2.10. The JAIC reports further in Subchapter &#13;
      5.3: "During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme &#13;
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port &#13;
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on &#13;
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough &#13;
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed &#13;
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise &#13;
      was documented in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. &#13;
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement.<br/>&#13;
      The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by the &#13;
      Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and very &#13;
      well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused detention &#13;
      or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular Port State &#13;
      Control." </font></p>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">(c) The Independent Fact &#13;
      Group (IFG), Stockholm searched the archives of the Shipinspec Stockholm &#13;
      office in autumn 1998 and found protocols about PSC inspections performed &#13;
      on the following days: </font></p>&#13;
    <blockquote> &#13;

        02.03.1994 </font></p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These dates include the &#13;
      take-over in Tallinn on 01.02.93, followed by two oil spills on 02.04.93 &#13;
      and 06.04.93, and another two in December 1993 and in March 1994 which are &#13;
      unknown. The RITS Exercise is not included. Actually Ulf Beijner, then the &#13;
      head of the Sjöfartsverket's Shipinspec office in Stockholm, confirmed to &#13;

      confirmed to Tommy Lindström, who investigated the matter on behalf of the &#13;
      relatives organisation SEA, that they had never carried out a real PSC inspection. &#13;

<blockquote> &#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Meyer Werft - &#13;
    Jos. L. Meyer GmbH - at Papenburg/Ems was founded already in 1795 and has &#13;
    been owned by the Meyer family ever since. During the last decades Meyer Werft &#13;
    has achieved an excellent reputation for the building of special-purpose vessels, &#13;
    in particular, passenger ships, luxury car/passenger ferries and Ro-Ro vessels. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Up to date more than &#13;
    60 of the above types of vessels have been built by Meyer Werft. Furthermore, &#13;
    the Yard is specialised in the building of passenger-ships and gas carriers &#13;
    for the transport of liquid and chemical gases. Presently about 60 passengerships/ferries &#13;
    and 47 gas carriers have been delivered. Shiprepair activities are mainly &#13;
    concentrated on jumboizing and converting ferries, passenger ships, freighters, &#13;
    and tankers. In addition, the Yard is the world's leader in converting freighters &#13;
    and tankers into livestock carriers. Up to now 25 vessels of this type have &#13;
    been converted for the transport of sheep and cows as well as camels and horses. &#13;
    Apart from the above-mentioned activities the Meyer Werft is also engaged &#13;
    in structural construction and engine building, which includes the fabrication &#13;
    of pressure tanks and special aluminium constructions. In 1975 a new shipyard &#13;
    was built which belongs to the most modern in Europe. In November 1987 the &#13;
    largest graving dock under roof was inaugurated which had to be lengthened &#13;
    by 100 m already in 1990/91. Presently about 2000 staff are employed. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">So far the Yard has &#13;
    built respectively has under construction/on order: </font></p>&#13;

    </blockquote>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious that &#13;
    survival in a very competitive, tough market was and is only possible by fine &#13;
    workmanship and delivery according to promise. For this the Meyer Werft is &#13;
    well known. The "Reference Lists for Ferries and Gastankers" - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.1.1.htm" target="_blank"> &#13;
    Enclosures 2.1.1</a> / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..1.2.htm" target="_blank">2.1.2 &#13;
    </a>- confirm this. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On this basis, as &#13;
    well as having very good relationships to Sweden and Finland, the Meyer Werft &#13;
    has succeeded since 1969 in obtaining orders to build a series of car/passenger &#13;
    ferries for AB Slite/Stockholm and AB Sally/ Mariehamn and - apart from the &#13;
    guarantee disputes usual for technically complicated newbuildings - delivering &#13;
    these to the entire satisfaction of the buyers. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All these vessels &#13;
    - except for the last one: SILJA EUROPA - have been employed in the Viking &#13;
    Line Service, either between Turku - Mariehamn - Stockholm or between Helsinki &#13;
    and Stockholm. This service was then operated by a consortium consisting of &#13;
    the Swedish AB Slite as well as the Finnish companies AB Sally and SF-Line. &#13;
    </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first ferry of &#13;
    these series by the name APOLLO was delivered in 1970 to AB Slite, followed &#13;
    by MV DIANA for the same owners, and VIKING 1, 3, 4 and 5 for AB Sally. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The third partner &#13;
    of the Viking Line consortium, SF-Line, ordered their newbuildings with other &#13;
    yards, e.g. the TURELLA was built by Sietas Yard, Hamburg and other ferries &#13;
    were built in Yugoslavia as well as by the then Wärtsilä Yard in Turku, Finland &#13;
    (e.g. MARIELLA). </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All of the vessels &#13;
    built by Meyer Werft for AB Slite and AB Sally were classed by Bureau Veritas &#13;
    (B.V.) and built under the supervision of the respective National Shipping &#13;
    Administration, i.e. for the Slite vessels the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and &#13;
    for the AB Sally vessels the Finnish Sjöfarts-styrelsen, the Finnish Board &#13;
    of Navigation (F.B.N.). The 6 ferries were sister vessels, apart from VIKING &#13;
    5 which had the same breadth but was 13.8 m longer. All vessels were constructed &#13;
    with visor, bow and stern ramps. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The building files &#13;
    of Meyer Werft reveal that due to the continued close co-operation lasting &#13;
    for years between the Yard, supervisors of owners as well as representatives &#13;
    of class and Sjöfartsverket respectively F.B.N. a relationship of confidence &#13;
    had developed between the participating persons. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On behalf of Bureau &#13;
    Veritas this was their inspector Günther Lohmann, who was engaged with Meyer &#13;
    Werft newbuildings for many years, whilst Sjöfartsverket was represented by &#13;
    the then Rotterdam office manager, H. Sjöholm and the representatives for &#13;
    F.B.N. were Gunnar Edelmann (shipbuilding matters/stability), Pertti Haatainen &#13;
    (lifesaving) and Jan Jansson (fire-fighting).</font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All 6 vessels had &#13;
    the connection visor/bow ramp, i.e. the upper part of the closed bow ramp &#13;
    extended into a box-shaped structure on the forecastle which was part of the &#13;
    visor. None of the vessels had the upper extension of the collision bulkhead &#13;
    above the bulkhead deck, i.e. the car deck, installed at the location which &#13;
    was required by SOLAS since 1948, but the weathertight bow ramp was generally &#13;
    considered to be the extension of the collision bulkhead. </font></p>&#13;
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Despite this deviation &#13;
    from the wording of SOLAS all these vessels, as well as more than 30 other &#13;
    ferries constructed similarly, were fully accepted by the Classification Societies &#13;
    and by the Maritime Administrations of the Nordic countries. According to &#13;
    the findings of the JAIC this practice was well known to insiders as the 'General &#13;
    Scandinavian Practice'. </font></p>&#13;
