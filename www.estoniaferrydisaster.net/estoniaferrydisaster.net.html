  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The German 'Group 
      of Experts' has now - as far as possible - completed its investigation of 
      the foundering of the M. V. ESTONIA, a disaster that has taken the greatest 
      toll of human life in the Baltic Sea in times of peace. The German 'Group 
      of Experts' has during the past five years performed a difficult investigation 
      in a partly hostile and reluctant environment. The work was carried out 
      during the first two years - 1995/1996 - in close co-operation with the 
      Swedish leader of the Technical Group of the Joint Accident Investigation 
      Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden (JAIC), Börje Stenström ( February 
      1997), and also with the Finnish member of the Technical Group, Dr. Tuomo 
      Karppinen and the expert Dr. Klaus Rahka. All the investigation results 
      of this 'Group of Experts' were submitted either verbally in joint meetings 
      with the members and the experts from Estonia, Finland and Sweden attending 
      or in letters with attached photos and/or video film documentation to the 
      JAIC. This documentation and information concerned the design, construction 
      and building of M. V. ESTONIA in general and the locking devices of the 
      bow visor in particular, including the load calculations, the co-operation 
      with the Classification Society Bureau Veritas, and the Owners. Furthermore, 
      detailed evaluations of all survivors' statements, statements and other 
      documentation such as photos and videos showing the condition of safety 
      relevant parts of the ferry before the casualty obtained from previous passengers 
      and crew members were submitted. In response, the JAIC submitted information 
      and documentation, and up until the end of 1996 a relatively intense exchange 
      of views and technical discussions took place which died away with Börje 
      Stenström. A very detailed evaluation of the condition of the visor performed 
      by metallurgical experts, of the objects recovered from the wreck or cut 
      off from the visor, of the video films from the wreck made by ROVs and divers, 
      of the testimony of shipyard employees having participated in the design, 
      construction and building of VIKING SALLY, of previous passengers and crew 
      members of the ferry as well as of survivors of the disaster form the backbone 
      of this Investigation Report and are the basis for its conclusions. Breaking 
      tests with mock-ups of the Atlantic lock were carried out by the Institute 
      for Shipbuilding of the Hamburg University in co-operation with a member 
      and an expert from the Finnish part of the JAIC. During the first half of 
      1997 it became evident that the JAIC would not change its first technical 
      findings and conclusions published in the so-called Part-Report in April 
      1995 in spite of all the evidence submitted by this 'Group of Experts' and 
      others which indicate a totally different chain of causation and sequence 
      of events. Therefore it was decided to demonstrate the own investigation 
      results to the Swedish public in two Exhibitions in the heart of the City 
      of Stockholm, because it was Sweden who had paid the highest death toll 
      in the disaster and consequently the Swedish public followed our investigations 
      very closely. As from the Exhibitions - especially after the second - considerable 
      support was received from Swedish citizens and further contact was made 
      with a number of very important witnesses of fact. This Investigation Report 
      covers all the evidence available to this 'Group of Experts' until 27.11.1999. 
      Whenever considered relevant the attention of the reader will be drawn to 
      the findings of the JAIC in comparison to the findings of this 'Group of 
      Experts'. During the course of the investigation and, in particular, during 
      the two exhibitions in Stockholm, many meetings with survivors and relatives 
      of the casualty victims took place, which left deep impressions. Many of 
      the relatives and survivors pleaded to assist them in the finding of the 
      truth. This authors of this Report have attempted to comply with this plea.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i><b>In summary 
      this investigation reveals that,</b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - M.V. ESTONIA

      of its authors, is left to the decision of the readers of this report. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">MV ESTONIA left Tallinn 
    with all four main engines running. When she was clear of the breakwater full 
    service speed was set. The four engines were hence set to produce 90% of their 
    maximum continuous rating of 17,600 kW, corresponding to a speed of 19.5-20.0 
    kn. The wind was southerly 8-10 m/s. Visibility was good, with occasional 
    rain showers. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 20.00 hours the 
    watch on the bridge was taken over by the second officer Peeter Kannussaar 
    and the third officer Andres Tammes. The voyage proceeded normally. Sea conditions 
    along the Estonian coast were moderate, but became more rough when the ship 
    left the sheltered waters. The ferry was now heeling between 2°- 4° to starboard 
    due to increasing wind pressure on the port side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the voyage continued 
    the wind velocity increased gradually and the wind veered to south-west. Visibility 
    was generally more than 10 nautical miles. At midnight the wind had increased 
    to south-westerly 15-20 m/s with a corresponding increase of the wave height 
    to now 3-4 m significant. The rolling and pitching of the vessel increased 
    substantially. Many passengers became seasick, but everybody on board felt 
    the extremely hard pitching which caused the ferry to shake and vibrate as 
    she was driven through the rough sea with full power. Low banging noises from 
    the bow area were continuously heard by many passengers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">ESTONIA followed 
    her normal route along the Estonian North coast on course 262° to a waypoint 
    of 59°20' N; 22°00' E which is confirmed by the observations of survivor Anders 
    Ericson, the watch mate of the meeting vessel AMBER and the trainee mate Einar 
    Kukk having been on the bridge until ca. 00.35 hours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the waypoint, 
    at about 00.30 hours, the bridge ordered the engine room to activate the stabiliser 
    fins, however, there were again problems with the starboard fin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 00.45/50 
    hours one or two crashes/dull bangs were heard from the forward part of the 
    car deck whereafter very hard metallic banging noises were heard and felt 
    in the forepart of the ferry. Shortly afterwards it was felt that the speed 
    had been reduced and the vessel was now making much softer pitch movements 
    and also started to roll, less to port and more to starboard. Noises of the 
    racing propellers were heard and respective vibrations felt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time 
    a first - weak - "Mayday" call from ESTONIA was heard by those on the bridge 
    of a Swedish ferry in the vicinity, however, no action was initiated since 
    the call apparently was not repeated. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 01.00 hours 
    a sharp bang was heard and a slight shock felt, the vessel's hull vibrated. 
    Passengers from the 1st deck started to rush upwards, others were alarmed. 
    Water was noted escaping under pressure from 0-deck to 1st deck. A little 
    later, the second and much heavier impact followed by the third one occurred. 
    The vessel stopped abruptly while turning to port. At 01.02 hours the ferry 
    heeled - very wide - probably 50° or more - to starboard and came back to 
    almost upright condition whereafter she heeled again very wide to starboard 
    and came back to about 10° starboard but then heeled in steps to starboard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was now 
    on a south-easterly heading with wind and sea from starboard abeam within 
    a very short time and all 4 main engines were automatically shut off, while 
    the auxiliary diesels kept running/generating electricity some time longer. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Passengers started 
    to rush up the staircases and panic developed in many places. Many passengers 
    were apparently trapped in their cabins where they were later found by the 
    divers. Lifejackets were distributed to those passengers who managed to reach 
    the boat deck. They jumped or were washed into the sea. Some managed to climb 
    into liferafts which had been released from the vessel. Reportedly only the 
    starboard lifeboats were launched but could not be used except for the emergency 
    motor boat No. 1 which was later seen by some survivors proceeding away from 
    those in the water. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a heel of approximately 
    40° the diesel generators also automatically shut off and the emergency generator 
    took over the power supply to a limited number of consumers including illumination 
    of alleyways and decks, when a weak female voice was heard calling "Häire, 
    häire, laevel on häire" the Estonian words for "Alarm, alarm, there is alarm 
    on the ship" over the public address system. Just a moment later the internal 
    alarm code for the crew - "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" meaning "Go to fire 
    stations No. 1 and No. 2" - was transmitted over the public address system 
    followed by the general lifeboat alarm. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first officially 
    registered Mayday call from MV ESTONIA was received at 01.22 hours. A second 
    Mayday call was transmitted shortly afterwards and by 01.24 hours fourteen 
    ship- and shore-based radio stations, including the Maritime Rescue Coordination 
    Centre (MRCC) in Turku, had received respectively automatically recorded the 
    Mayday message. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The heeling to starboard 
    increased stepwise further and water continued to enter the accommodation 
    decks and the car deck through the partly open bow ramp and the starboard 
    stern ramp with increasing speed. The starboard side of the ship was submerged 
    at about 01.30 hours, with the visor still attached to bow ramp and forepeak 
    deck. During the final stage of flooding the ferry was completely upside down. 
    The visor fell off the ferry at a heel of approximately 130°/140° while the 
    ship sank stern first and disappeared from the radar screens of ships in the 
    area at about 01.53 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Rescue efforts were 
    initiated by the ferries in the vicinity while MRCC Turku reacted only rather 
    late. About one hour after ESTONIA had sunk, the first of the four passenger 
    ferries in the vicinity - M.V. MARIELLA - arrived on the scene of the casualty. 
    Rescue helicopters were activated and the first one arrived at 03.05 hours. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the night 
    and early morning, helicopters and assisting ships rescued the official number 
    of 138 people, of whom one later died in hospital. During the day and on the 
    two following days 92 bodies were recovered, thus it has to be assumed that 
    most of the missing persons are still inside the wreck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The wreck was found 
    in international waters within Finland's Search and Rescue Area, resting on 
    the seabed at a water depth of about 80 m on a heading of 95° and with a starboard 
    list of about 120°. The visor was missing and the bow ramp as well as the 
    starboard stern ramp were found to be slightly open. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The position of the 
    wreck was established to be 59°22,9' N, 21°41,9' E, while the visor was allegedly 
    found on position 59°23,0' N, 21°39,4' E, i.e. about 1500 m to the West of 
    the wreck. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b><font size="4">2.2 
  'The General Scandinavian Practice' </font></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 'Group of Experts' 
    has also looked into the origin of the so-called 'General Scandinavian Practice' 
    which is meant to be the attitude of the Scandinavian National Maritime Administrations, 
    in particular of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen 
    respectively the Finnish Board of Navigation (F.B.N.), in respect of the interpretation 
    of and the dealing with certain SOLAS Rules. This refers, in particular, to 
    the location of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck, which on the car/passenger ferries is the car deck. This is regulated 
    by SOLAS 1974, Chapter II-1, Rule 9 (1979 Edition) and exemptions are only 
    possible according to Rule 1 (c) if the route of the vessel does not lead 
    more than 20 nm from the nearest land. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the early years 
    of the Ro-Ro ferries, i.e. end of the 1950's/beginning of the 1960's, the 
    ferries were rather small and sailed only short distances and hence were never 
    more than 20 nm off the nearest land. In this time the maritime administrations 
    accepted the bow ramp in combination with the front bulkheads as the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, no matter where they 
    were located.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In searching for 
    the origin of the authorities' attitude it was found that apparently for the 
    first time on the ferries PRINS BERTIL and PRINSESSAN CHRISTINA, built in 
    Aarhus in 1960/61, the bow ramps had been accepted as the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck by the National Maritime Authorities, 
    most probably with the restriction not to proceed more than 20 nm from the 
    nearest land. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, it has 
    to be noted that at least Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N. took the view already 
    in 1959 that all structural matters - including the position of the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead - would have to be dealt with by the Classification 
    Societies, no matter whether SOLAS requirements, which actually were the responsibility 
    of the Maritime Administrations, were involved or not. This attitude is revealed 
    in a letter dated 07.04.59 written by the then Kungl. Sjöfartsstyrelsen now 
    Sjöfartsverket (attached as Enclosure 2.2.3) and in a statement which H. Valkonen 
    of the F.B.N. gave at a meeting with this 'Group of Experts' on 27.10.95 (Memo 
    attached as Enclosure 2.2.4). In other words, as soon as the Classification 
    Society had issued the Class Certificates the National Maritime Administration 
    issued the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, thereby confirming that the 
    ferry complied with SOLAS, although they did not know this for sure but merely 
    assumed that the Classification Society had checked the compliance of the 
    relevant vessel with SOLAS. This actually was the case only after the Classification 
    Societies had incorporated SOLAS 1974 into their Rules, which, however, was 
    not done simultaneously by all of them; for example Det norske Veritas (DnV) 
    did it quite early while Bureau Veritas did it quite late. As most of the 
    Swedish and Finnish ferries were classified by DnV, both Sjöfartsverket and 
    F.B.N. were accustomed to having the Classification Societies take care of 
    the structural SOLAS requirements. Bureau Veritas, however, incorporated SOLAS 
    1974 into its Rules only in 1981, i.e. after DIANA II and VIKING SALLY had 
    been built as will be explained in the subsequent chapters, and thus did not 
    feel responsible for SOLAS matters during this time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of 
    the investigation it was also discovered that the F.B.N. had issued an 'Exemption 
    Certificate' to VIKING SALLY for a deviation from the SOLAS requirements in 
    respect of the lifesaving appliances, however not for the wrongly placed upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead, being the bow ramp on this as well as 
    on most of the car/passenger ferries trading in the Baltic in those years. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Revealing in this 
    context is the correspondence in 1981 between a Swedish ferry operator, being 
    in the process of taking over a foreign flag ferry, subsequently renamed KRONPRINSESSAN 
    VICTORIA, and Sjöfartsverket wherefrom the following is quoted:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Owners to Sjöfartsverket:<br>
    <i>«With reference to the previous exchange of communication we have noted 
    that the bow ramp of this vessel is placed different than required by SOLAS 
    1974. We are requesting you to check this and reply by return whether the 
    location of the ramp is wrong.»</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) Reply by Sjöfartsverket 
    to owners:<br>
    <i>«The location of the inner bow ramp is in conformity with the national 
    as well as international practice and is accepted by us in the present condition. 
    <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    vessel has the required Swedish and international certificate which is also 
    accepted by Denmark and West Germany, whilst Sweden in the same manner is 
    also accepting the certificates of these countries. It is not the intention 
    of Sjöfartsverket to take up these questions with the Maritime Administrations 
    of said countries.»</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Copies of the respective 
    telex exchange can be found as Supplement 215 to the Final Report of the JAIC. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has 
    to be assumed that in the course of the years and with ever growing ferries 
    three alternatives concerning the bow ramp/upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead issue developed, viz.:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a) The bow ramp 
    is the upper extension and is located in accordance with SOLAS requirements 
    (the ferry could sail outside 20 nm range without restrictions). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b) The bow ramp is 
    not the upper extension, but at the location on the car deck, as required 
    by SOLAS, a "partial collision door" is installed (also this ferry could sail 
    without restrictions). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c) The bow ramp (in 
    combination with the front bulkheads) is the upper extension, but is not located 
    at the proper place as required by SOLAS and no "partial collision door" is 
    installed. (This ferry could sail inside the 20 nm range, but the National 
    Maritime Administration would have to issue an 'Exemption Certificate' which 
    would have to be renewed annually together with the PSSC.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to a)<br>
    This version complies fully with SOLAS and from this point of view creates 
    no problems, however, the commercial side is treated badly because in order 
    to take as many cars on the car deck as possible the bow ramp has to be as 
    far forward as possible and this leads over to either version b.) or version 
    c.).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> as to b)<br>
    This version was already being built into ferries at the end of the 1970's 
    operating in the Irish Sea, North Sea and the English Channel (although not 
    on all of them). It complies fully with the respective SOLAS requirements. 
    This version was also part of the initial quotations/specifications for DIANA 
    II and VIKING SALLY submitted by Meyer Werft to the respective owners, whereafter 
    - after consultations with Sjöfartsverket - respectively F.B.N. - the "partial 
    collision doors" were deleted. The result was version c.). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to c)<br>
    This version existed on DIANA II as well as on VIKING SALLY and on dozens 
    of other ferries in the Baltic and elsewhere. The acceptance of this configuration 
    by the National Maritime Administrations of Sweden and Finland, no matter 
    whether the ferries sailed inside or outside of the 20-nm range and without 
    issuing an Exemption Certificate to cover the wrong location of the upper 
    extension is understood to be the 'General Scandinavian Practice'. It was 
    followed for example by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket responsible for 
    the DIANA II when she was sailing between Trelleborg and Rostock, still in 
    1994 when the Manager - Åke Sjöblom - signed the PSSC thereby confirming that 
    she fully complied with SOLAS, which she did not, because her bow ramp (with 
    the front bulkheads) was the upper extension but as such located too much 
    forward. As she stayed within the 20-nm range in the course of her route the 
    simple issuance of an Exemption Certificate would have put the PSSC in compliance 
    with SOLAS, however, it was not issued. The same refers to VIKING SALLY and 
    SILJA STAR whereas the situation as to the WASA KING and ESTONIA was quite 
    different, as will be explained in subsequent chapters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this respect 
    it is remarkable to note that the predecessor of the ESTONIA in the Stockholm-Tallinn 
    service, the Swedish flag NORD ESTONIA, owned by Nordström & Thulin, the technical 
    managers and part-owners of the ESTONIA, had sailed between Stockholm and 
    Tallinn for about 2 years under the strict supervision of Sjöfartsverket without 
    having the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck at 
    the location required by SOLAS and without having a "partial collision door" 
    at the location required by SOLAS but with an unrestricted PSSC issued and 
    annually renewed by Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of 
    the explanations above it can be concluded that definitely in the years 1978/80 
    it corresponded to the state-of-the-art as well as to the 'rules of the art' 
    that on car/passenger ferries operating in the Baltic Sea not more than 20 
    nm from the nearest land the watertight-built bow ramps were accepted as upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, and compliance with 
    the SOLAS requirements was assumed even without the issuance of an Exemption 
    Certificate. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 1979 - subsequent 
    to the previously described series of 6 ferries - the DIANA II (Hull No. S 
    592) was delivered to the Viking Line partner, AB Slite, Stockholm. Not only 
    the tonnage of 11 700 GRT but also the fitments of this vessel demonstrate 
    the speedy development of ferry-shipping in this part of the world, which 
    became known as the 'Baltic phenomenon'. Both DIANA II and her near-sister, 
    the following newbuilding from Meyer Werft VIKING SALLY, were products of 
    the 'Baltic phenomenon' and considered to be trend setters for the ever growing 
    'jumbo' ferries in this trading area. (See further Chapter 4.)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b><font size="4">Newbuilding 
  contract and approval procedure</font> </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As far as could be 
    ascertained DIANA II was designed by the Stockholm consulting office Simson 
    Ship in close co-operation with AB Slite and Meyer Werft as an enlarged version 
    of the predecessors APPOLO and DIANA. According to the newbuilding contract 
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.5.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.3.1.5</a>) 
    - written in German - Meyer Werft was inter alia obliged to build the vessel 
    according to SOLAS 1974. Consequently, an upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck at the minimum distance from the forward 
    perpendicular as required by SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 9, was imperative. 
    Exemptions could be granted by the National Maritime Administration of the 
    flag state - in this case the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - should the vessel operate 
    exclusively in "sheltered waters", i.e. not more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land (SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 1 (C) ). The position of Sjöfartsverket 
    in this respect has already been explained in this report in the preceding 
    Chapter 2.2. It reveals that the bow ramp was accepted by the National Maritime 
    Administration as the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers to 
    Bureau Veritas according to the memo concerning a discussion in the BV-Hamburg 
    office on 23 June 1978 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.6.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.3.1.6</a>). This office is responsible for the plan approval of vessels 
    built in Germany to B.V. classification rules. In this memo it is stated under 
    item 1: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The collision 
    bulkhead has to be extended up to the C-deck by a watertight ramp. The location 
    of the ramp as to the forward perpendicular can be determined by means of 
    the geometrical means in the obliquity. Agreement with B.V. and the Swedish 
    Maritime Administration.« </i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the 
    building files reveal that the Yard subsequently endeavoured to obtain this 
    agreement directly from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket. This was basically done 
    verbally in discussions and/or telephone conversations, which, however, were 
    recorded in the diary of the Meyer Werft project manager H.Wahnes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">So it is stated for 
    example in a note dated 23 October 1978 under item 2: <br>

      was the owner of AB Slite and Mr. Kure was his technical adviser.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the above quoted 
    notes of project manager H.Wahnes it is documented that: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">a) According to 
      an agreement with Bureau Veritas and Sjöfartsverket the collision bulkhead 
      was to be extended above bulkhead deck to C-deck by means of a watertight 
      ramp, the location of which was to be determined by the geometrical mean 
      in the obliquity (freeboard-deck = car deck = A-deck).<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) In the 
      presence of the owner, C.B. Myrsten, and his technical consultant Kure, 
      it was discussed and agreed by the representative of Sjöfartsverket, Sjöholm, 
      that the bow ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
      above bulkhead deck, i.e. as such there was a deviation from the requirements 
      of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 
    hindsight the cited documentation in respect of such an important deviation 
    from the SOLAS 1974 requirements appears to be meagre. The following, however, 
    has to be considered:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The Yard had 
      already delivered 6 vessels of similar design to the same owners trading 
      in the same service for which also DIANA II was built. Upon application 
      of the owners to the National Maritime Administrations of the respective 
      flag states these had issued - without problems - the 'Passenger Ship Safety 
      Certificates', thereby confirming that the vessels complied with 'SOLAS 
      1974' requirements.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the 
      same manner the National Maritime Administration had dealt with a large 
      number of other car/passenger ferries in the Baltic. This was in conformity 
      with the 'General Scandinavian Practice' described in the preceding Chapter 
      2.2.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the 
      'pre-computer age' it was uncommon to confirm every agreement in writing. 
      Verbal agreements and handwritten notes or memos were accepted and honoured.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is the considered 
    opinion of the members of this 'Group of Experts' that on basis of the above 
    explained notes/memos in connection with own knowledge and experience the 
    deviation from SOLAS 1974 in regard to the location of the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck was approved by the competent 
    Swedish Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket - already in the planning 
    stage of the vessel in accordance with accepted customs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After all, this 
    is confirmed by the fact that the 'Sjöfartsverket' upon delivery of DIANA 
    II issued to her owners the 'Passenger Ship Safety Certificate' (PSSC) and 
    has, ever since, renewed it annually without a trading restriction and without 
    issuing an Exemption Certificate. The PSSC valid at the time of the ESTONIA 
    casualty was issued on 10.06.1994 by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket and 
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..3.1.9.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    2.3.1.9.</a> The certificate was signed by chief inspector Åke Sjöblom who 
    also inspected ESTONIA during her last afternoon in Tallinn (see Chapter 15). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The locking devices 
    of the visor and bow ramp were calculated by the subcontractor von Tell AB, 
    Gothenburg and - most probably - also by the Yard. Although the von Tell archive 
    in Gothenburg - subsequently taken over by Kvaerner Shipsequipment AB - contains 
    considerable design and calculation material concerning DIANA II, the respective 
    calculations relating to the locking devices of the visor and bow ramp are, 
    however, missing. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.25.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.25.</a> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time when 
    these calculations were made, i.e. in 1978, the B.V. Rules still did not contain 
    any specific requirements for the dimensioning of the locking devices for 
    visors of Ro-Ro vessels in general and also not for car/ passenger ferries 
    in particular, and although B.V. classed Ro-Ro vessels had had a number of 
    serious bow door incidents in previous years - see Chapter 33 - for example:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Swedish flag 
    STENA SAILOR, commissioned only in 1973, broke the locking devices of her 
    bow door already on 16.01.74 and called at a port of refuge. The subsequent 
    investigation by Sjöfartsverket revealed that sister-vessels had had similar 
    incidents before and that the locking devices were underdimensioned for the 
    loads to be absorbed. Since Sjöfartsverket as well as the other maritime administrations 
    of the Nordic countries were lacking technical staff and facilities to carry 
    out load calculations themselves, this was delegated to a number of acknowledged 
    Classification Societies, among them B.V., who had to do these calculations 
    anyway, respectively had to check the calculations performed by the Yard and/or 
    its subcontractor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sjöfartsverket informed 
    B.V. about the results of the STENA SAILOR incident investigation, viz. that 
    the locking devices of this less than one year old vessel had been too weak. 
    B.V. replied at the end of July 1974 that it was their intention to increase 
    the requirement for the locking devices of bow doors. Since Sjöfartsverket's 
    internal system at that time did not contain a follow-up of such promises, 
    it was apparently left to the respective class of a vessel, in this case B.V., 
    to determine the strengthening of the locking devices and it was not cross-checked 
    by Sjöfartsverket whether this had really been carried out (see Investigation 
    Report of Magnus Sjöberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.3.116.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.3.116</a>).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was the situation 
    in 1978 when DIANA II - including the locking devices of her bow visor - was 
    designed and subsequently approved by B.V. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the Building Contract 
    required the Yard to build the vessel in conformity with the requirements 
    of SOLAS 1974 the initial set of drawings contained a "partial collision door" 
    (upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck) 
    at a location according to those requirements. Reference is made to part of 
    a drawing dated 20.12.79 with the edges marked yellow at both longitudinal 
    bulkheads where the "partial collision door" was planned to fit in at frame 
    150 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.14.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.14</a>). Part of the General Arrangement Plan - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.15.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.1.15</a> - shows what was actually built for the following reasons:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already 
    during the negotiations of the building contract agreement was reached concerning 
    the function and location of the bow ramp. This is revealed in a telex sent 
    on 30.08.79 by Peter Motikat of Meyer Werft to Alf Johansson of AB Sally - 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.16.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.16</a> - where it is stated under item 6:<br>
    <b><i>»6. Bow and stern ramp arrangements according to DIANA II.«</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Peter Motikat 
    was negotiating the building contract on behalf of Meyer Werft, whilst Alf 
    Johansson was negotiating on behalf of AB Sally, then owned by the Johansson 
    family.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it was the intention 
    to build the foreship of both vessels identically the location of the bow 
    ramp and its relevance as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    bulkhead deck was consequently therewith established. This is revealed also 
    from item 3123 of the specification, where it is stated: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow 
      Ramp One watertight bow ramp with longitudinal stiffeners arranged to give 
      a free opening of 5.5 m width and 5.0 m height. In lowered position, the 
      bow ramp to reach minimum 1.5 m forward of bulbous bow's front. At the end 
      of the ramp hinged flaps to be arranged. The bow ramp cannot be operated 
      if the bow door is not in open position.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also during the negotiations 
    with these owners the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck had been discussed. The yard management knew from the simultaneous negotiations 
    concerning the conversion of VIKING 4 into EARL GRANVILLE (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.17.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.17</a>) that the English Maritime Authorities, DOT = Department of Trade, 
    as well as Lloyd's Register demanded the installation of the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead at the location required by SOLAS 1974 before the 
    vessel was permitted to operate under English flag. During the conversion 
    the upper extension was installed as "partial collision door" at the location 
    required. Consequently Mr. Motikat informed Alf Johansson accordingly offering 
    the installation of a similar "partial collision door" on VIKING SALLY and, 
    as a matter of fact, the installation was included in the original quotation. 
    Alf Johansson, however, stated to have the agreement of F.B.N. to comply also 
    in the case of VIKING SALLY again with the 'General Scandinavian Practice', 
    i.e. bow ramp = upper extension of collision bulkhead and no separate "partial 
    collision door" required. Mr. Motikat insisted on having this agreement entered 
    into the building specification, where it can be found under item 3123:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
      »Partial Collision Door For the intended service not required by F.B.N.«</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' 
    is therefore convinced that it had been the wish of owners, and was approved 
    by the Classification Society as well as by the National Shipping Administration, 
    F.B.N., already during the planning stage of the newbuilding that the bow 
    ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck, although its location did not comply with the respective requirements 
    of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection 
    attention is drawn to the fact that the installation of a "partial collision 
    door" had been included in the initial quotation with DM 45.000,--. This amount 
    was subsequently credited to the owners as revealed by an entry in the 'More/Less' 
    list of project manager H.Wahnes (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.18.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.18</a>). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the 
    'More/Less' list all items differing from the quotation are listed for final 
    discussion with the owners. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the position 
    of the bow ramp of ESTONIA did not satisfy the SOLAS requirements for an upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead an exemption certificate should have been 
    issued on the condition that the vessel in the course of its voyages did not 
    proceed more than 20 nautical miles from the nearest land. This was the intention 
    when the ferry was built and actually she sailed in "sheltered waters" with 
    certainty for the first 101/2 years of her life. According to Germanischer 
    Lloyd it was common practice in the early 1980's not to issue exemption certificates, 
    but a respective remark was made in the PSSC. It was said to be only in 1985/86 
    that IMO required the issuance of exemption certificates in case the National 
    Maritime Administration made use of the right given to them by Rule 1(c) respectively 
    Regulation 1.4 preceding each SOLAS chapter, viz. to exempt owners from compulsory 
    obligations in case the vessel did not proceed more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land in the course of her voyage, i.e. remained in "sheltered waters". Consequently 
    from the point of view of the newbuilding yard, nothing more could be done.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' 
    has also investigated the reasons why the location of the wheelhouse on VIKING 
    SALLY is different in comparison to DIANA II. The General Arrangement Plan 
    No. 5675/79 dated 05.09.79, and being part of the building contract, still 
    shows the wheelhouse in the same location as on DIANA II, i.e. above the front 
    of the superstructures. In the specification - also being part of the building 
    contract, however it is already stated on page 4-16 under item 4513 - Wheelhouse 
    and Chartroom - inter alia: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Yard investigates 
    to arrange wheelhouse 11 m to stern.« Owners had thus already at an early 
    stage considered having the bridge installed somewhat further aft. According 
    to Mr. Bernard Meyer this, as well as the altered shape of the funnel, is 
    to be attributed to the proposal of a Finnish architect who wanted to give 
    the vessel a better silhouette with these changes. Against additional costs, 
    Meyer Werft carried out both changes according to the wishes of the owners 
    and with the approval of the class and the F.B.N. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the new location 
    of the bridge it was no more possible to see the forecastle deck, i.e. the 
    bow visor from the middle of the wheelhouse, the command centre of the vessel. 
    Therefore at both sides in way of the connection between wheelhouse and closed 
    wings one window was installed just above the floor of the wheelhouse. Through 
    these windows the forward part of the visor was visible. In addition, at the 
    top of the visor a flag pole was installed with a blue light fitted on top 
    which was shining aft only. This flag pole with the blue light also acted 
    as a steering aid for pilot, watch officer and helmsman. This installation 
    cannot be found in the specification of the building contract as the decision 
    to move the location of the bridge aft was made only after signing of the 
    contract.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to 
    the presence of the flag pole with aft-shining blue light on top, up-and-down 
    movements of the visor would have been very well visible from the bridge in 
    the darkness unless the light was defect. - See page 110. Upon inspection 
    of the visor in Hangö the flag pole was found broken from the visor, but it 
    is still connected to the visor by means of the cable and is hanging below 
    its initial position underneath the visor. (Visor is resting on steel blocks 
    in upside down position.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The change 
    of the bridge location was approved by the Classification Society as well 
    as by the F.B.N., as can be seen from part of the drawing 1116 "Arrangement 
    of Top Lanterns" - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.19.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.19</a> - which was approved by Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on 09.01.80.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As with DIANA II 
    the Yard had also subcontracted for VIKING SALLY the supply and installation 
    of the hydraulic arrangements and locking devices of among other things the 
    visor and bow ramp to von Tell GmbH, Sophienallee 24, Hamburg.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Von Tell GmbH, Hamburg 
    was founded in 1963 by the main shareholder of von Tell Trading & Co. AB, 
    Gothenburg, Mr. Dahlien, and the E. Rottmann KG, Hamburg. The company basically 
    acted as sales office for von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg which was 
    then acting as design/ construction office and spare-part supplier for hydraulic 
    installations, hatch covers and the like. Based on a respective contract von 
    Tell GmbH, Hamburg was obliged to order everything which they were able to 
    contract in Germany exclusively with von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg. 
    Accordingly the technicians of von Tell Trading & Co. AB worked out quotations, 
    took part in technical discussions - also at Meyer Werft - and carried out 
    all necessary calculations, furnished the respective drawings to the relevant 
    Classification Society and Maritime Administration, obtained the required 
    approvals, etc. Once the installation phase had commenced, it was the duty 
    of von Tell GmbH, Hamburg among other things to make available to the Yard 
    a qualified technician who assisted the Yard in all technical matters concerning 
    the equipment supplied by von Tell and who, at the same time, took care that 
    the parts supplied by von Tell were properly installed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to VIKING SALLY, 
    Meyer Werft ordered under order no. 3344/79-S 590 dated 27 September 1979 
    among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote>

      visor has an assumed weight of 56 mts and is moved by 2 directly acting 
      hydraulic cylinders. The cylinders have to be fitted with flexible bearings 
      to compensate possible misalignments. The lowering speed is to be adjusted 
      by 2 throttle non-return valves, 2 ice-breaking cylinders support the opening 
      procedure at the beginning and are softening the closing procedure at the 
      end.<br>
      Locking of the closed visor shall be hydraulically. The system has to be 
      constructed in such a way that the locking devices remain in locked position 
      even if the hydraulic is switched off. Contact switches have to be fitted 
      to the locking devices which activate the lamps at the control panel and 
      on the bridge when the locking devices are in closed position. An additional 
      device has to be supplied for the Atlantic lock. An hydraulically operated 
      fixing device has to be fitted which will be engaged at the end of the opening 
      procedure. The bow ramp has to be hydraulically interlocked against the 
      visor.<br>
      Your extent of supply for this installation is as follows:<br>
      ...................... </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Within the agreed 
    time frame von Tell supplied the required drawings to the Bureau Veritas plan 
    approval office in Hamburg as well as to the Yard and also supplied the ordered 
    material to the Yard for installation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The installations 
    as such were supervised by two technicians on behalf of von Tell, i.e. Günther 
    Todsen, an employee of HDW-Kiel, who was leased by von Tell whenever required, 
    and Herbert Brand from von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg. As the major 
    part of the supervision was carried out by Todsen, his statement has been 
    taken and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a> together with an office translation. It explains in detail the 
    installation of the visor hinges and locking devices up to the final acceptance 
    of the visor documented by the so-called Receipt or Transfer Certificate signed 
    by representatives of the owners, B.V., the shipyard, and von Tell (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.22.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.22</a>). Consequently the following might be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to Purchase 
    Order No. 3344/79-S 590 dated 27.09.79, page 3, third paragraph, von Tell 
    had to supply among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>».... also 
      the control scheme for the above described movements of the bow visor including

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As far as can be 
    reconstructed von Tell calculated the loads developing during the opening 
    and closing of visor and also the loads on the locking devices to be absorbed 
    by vessel's construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These were apparently 
    submitted by von Tell AB, Gothenburg to and discussed with the Bureau Veritas 
    Hamburg office (see telex von Tell AB, Gothenburg to BV-Hamburg dated 18.03.80 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.4.2.23</a>). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the 
    Yard made its own calculations to ascertain the load requirements for the 
    locking devices and hinges of the visor, which were subsequently submitted 
    to von Tell and obviously approved by them (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.24.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.24</a> - 4 pages). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the then applicable 
    B.V. Rules did not contain requirements for the calculation of sea-loads on 
    visors, the Yard used the "pressure heights" stated in the so-called "Note 
    Documentaire" issued by B.V. on 05.04.1976 for these load calculations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor loads 
    assumed in the calculations as well as the way of calculating the loads to 
    be distributed to the fixing points of the visor were, however, in agreement 
    with assumed loads and calculation methods applied at that time by other Classification 
    Societies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As far as it could 
    be determined, the design load calculations were made by von Tell AB, Gothenburg, 
    on the basis of the Lloyd's Register requirements, the results were submitted 
    to BV-Hamburg (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.23</a> - telex von Tell AB, Gothenburg to BV-Hamburg dated 18.03.80) 
    and finally approved. It has not been possible to establish with certainty 
    whether the calculations made by the design office of the Yard were submitted 
    also to B.V. for examination because these calculations were just carried 
    out as a sort of internal control of what the subcontractor von Tell had calculated. 
    This is part of the standard procedure at Meyer Werft. As there is no date 
    on any of the 4 sheets of the Yard's calculations, it is unknown whether these 
    calculations actually reflect the last stage.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also 
    a recent check of what is left in the old von Tell AB files has only revealed 
    that the respective folders with the calculations for the visor locking devices 
    for both DIANA II and VIKING SALLY are empty. The memo concerning this file 
    check is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.25.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

      drawings contain remarks about the welding seam thickness in general or 
      in reference to particular parts to be welded. The Yard drawings do not 
      contain such remarks as to the thickness of welding seams for the following 
      reasons:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Meyer Werft 
      designers do not state the required thickness of welding seams individually 
      on the respective drawings, but draw up a so-called "welding table" for 
      each newbuilding. In this table the minimum thickness of welding seams for 
      particular structural parts is stated. The table is approved by the Classification 
      Society and available to all welders/foremen. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2.) In case 
      the particular structural part to be welded does not fall under the categories 
      listed in the welding table, the welder follows the Yard's general welding 
      standard.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3.) The Yard's 
      general welding standard requires for the welding of structural parts, accessible 
      from both sides, a seam thickness of minimum fifty to seventy per cent of 
      the thickness of the part to be welded. This assures that the structural 
      part to be welded to another part is connected by welding seams with a thickness 
      of at least 100% of its own cross-section. As to the welding seams connecting 
      the bushings with the lugs of the Atlantic lock on the forepeak deck they 
      were 7-8 mm thick on each side because the thickness of the lugs was 15 
      mm.</font></p>

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on 
      the original drawings, 1:10 scaled "burning sketches" were made and fed 
      into the photo-electric scanner steering the cutting machine, which subsequently 
      cut-out lugs for Atlantic lock, hinge plates and side locks, which thereafter 
      were transported to the locksmith shop. Atlantic lock lugs were 15 mm and 
      60 mm, side locks and hinge plates 60 mm. The parts of lugs and hinge plates 
      subsequently to be welded to the vessel's structure were oversized.</font></p>

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One bushing 
      supplied by von Tell was welded into the centre and port lugs, and another 
      smaller bushing was welded into the starboard lug supported by a bracket. 
      Both bushings were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both 
      sides in accordance with Yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings 
      whilst the lugs were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the 
      von Tell representative G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he would 
      never have accepted the 3 mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains 
      of the Atlantic lugs after the casualty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After welding 
      the parts were again transported to the locksmith shop for cleaning and 
      grinding of the welds. </font></p>

      board:<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the 
      visor had been properly adjusted and fitted to its hinges, the lugs of the 
      Atlantic lock were adjusted by cutting off the oversize part as required 
      to obtain alignment with the hydraulic cylinder and closing bolt, and, also 
      with the big visor lug.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Welding of 
      the lugs and the supporting plates (also 15 mm) carrying the hydraulic cylinder 
      was performed by 7-8 mm seams at each side according to the testimony of 
      the welder and his foreman, which is confirmed by the von Tell representative 
      G.Todsen. For further details please see 2.4.6. below. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the above 
    it has to be concluded that the welds connecting the bushings with the lugs 
    of the Atlantic lock were made full load-carrying joints by using appropriate 
    manufacturing techniques, and that therefore the load carrying cross-section 
    of this locking device did satisfy the applied design and was incorporated 
    into the actual installation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It furthermore has 
    to be concluded that based on the above outlined evidence the ca. 3 mm welds 
    visible on the remains of the Atlantic lugs do not originate from the Meyer 
    Werft production and must have been laid at some later occasion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As stated above, 
    the order from Meyer Werft to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg is dated 27 September 
    1979. As the relevant parts of the visor and bow ramp were meant to be identical 
    to the DIANA II design, the first drawings were ready at an early stage and 
    sent by von Tell AB, Gothenburg to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg and from there to 
    the BV-Hamburg office for approval and to the Yard for subsequent production. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus the von Tell 
    drawing 49111-330 - 'General Arrangement of Visor and Bow Ramp' - was already 
    approved by B.V. on 5 November 1979, however, with the following remarks in 
    red handwriting: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Arrangement of 
    locking devices subject to the approval of the National Authorities." <br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(The other 
    remarks will be dealt with in the following chapter.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to this remark 
    von Tell AB wrote to the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on the 14 December 
    1979 informing them about the newbuilding and requesting details of the drawings 
    to be submitted for approval. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.27.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.27.</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">F.B.N. replied that 
    they assumed that B.V. would examine the drawings of, among other things, 
    the visor and bow ramp and that only in case the Classification Society should 
    be in doubt about the interpretation of the SOLAS Convention details by F.B.N. 
    should drawings be sent to their office. In such case the problem should be 
    clearly defined.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not exactly 
    known what von Tell AB did as a result of these comments from F.B.N. In any 
    event, according to the F.B.N. there was no more correspondence in this respect 
    in their files. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has, however, 
    to be assumed that von Tell AB spoke thereafter to B.V. Hamburg, who apparently 
    were prepared to do the approval of the locking devices as well as of the 
    surrounding ship construction. This is confirmed by the exchange of communication 
    between von Tell AB / von Tell GmbH / BV-Hamburg as stated below:</font></p>

        "reserve" - which might be used in addition to the hydraulically operated 
        locking pins and the Atlantic lock. <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b><br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Representatives 
        of von Tell, Hamburg have explained that "reserve" has to be understood 
        as "additional", i.e. these manual securings should be used in heavy weather 
        as "additional" locks. </font> </p>

    with the operations required by their Rules for the purpose of obtaining the 
    classification under Special Survey, i.e. construction drawings were to be 
    checked against the rules and the building of the vessel was to be supervised,

    whilst in all other cases the 'YES' boxes are marked.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    interpretation of the B.V. head office this means that the Yard has requested 
    B.V. just to issue the Load Line Certificate and to specifically exclude any 
    Statutory Certificates. Actually Meyer Werft had filed a further application 
    dated 21 April 1980 with Bureau Veritas, viz. "Application for an International 
    Freeboard Certificate or for an International Load Line Exemption Certificate 
    within the Scope of the International Convention on Load Lines 1966" which 
    would mean that the Yard applied for the same services a second time (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.33.htm">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.33</a>). The Load Line Certificate was in fact issued by B.V.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1979/1980 the 
    "1977 Rules of B.V." were in force. According to §§ 11-44, indentations 2 
    and 3 of those rules the following applied to bow visors: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2 - Bow and 
      stern doors <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">21 
      - When the ship is equipped with a bow door, to allow access to garage, 
      the collision bulkhead must have a removable part. This design is acceptable 
      only above bulkhead deck and only if the removable part has a watertightness 
      and a strength equivalent to those of fixed rule bulkhead. <br>
      A movable access ramp may be used for this purpose.<br>
      22 - Scantlings of plating and stiffeners of a bow door are to be equivalent 
      to those of adjacent shell structure.«</font></i></p>

    Enclosure 2.4.3.34</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    the bow ramp, located above bulkhead deck = car deck, served as the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead no matter what the distance to the forward 
    perpendicular was, provided the bow ramp was watertight and had a strength 
    equivalent to those of fixed collision bulkheads. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These conditions 
    were fulfilled by the bow ramp of VIKING SALLY, thus the construction complied 
    with the B.V. Rules in force at the time the vessel was built. Only one year 
    later, in 1981, the SOLAS 1974 Rules were incorporated into the B.V. Rules 
    which had no more effect on VIKING SALLY because she had already been delivered 
    in June 1980. </font></p>

    the bow visor in its entirety already on 20.06.80 by his signature on the

    drawings 1103 and 49111-330, i.e.</font></p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As stated above, 
    this drawing was approved only on 20.06.80 - the day the vessel went out for 
    trials - thus shortly before her delivery - and returned to the Yard subsequently, 
    and it is indeed the question of what use such remarks are if they are made 
    on drawings which are returned to the Yard only after the vessel has already 
    left. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is slightly 
    different with the von Tell drawing 49111-330 - General Arrangement of Bow 
    Visor and Bow Ramp - which was approved already on 05.11.79 and subsequently 
    returned to von Tell with the following remarks in red: </font></p>

      4. High pressure flexible pipes must be approved by B.V.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V.'s explanation 
    for these remarks in their letter of 10.01.95: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»By the remark 
      concerning the National Authorities it was made clear that locking devices 
      were considered as an item subject to the examination and approval of the 
      Finnish Authorities issuing the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate of the 
      vessel.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In order to obtain 
    clarification how this was actually to be interpreted the official opinion 
    of B.V. was requested via their Stockholm lawyer - Bengt-Åke Johnson - who 
    has commented as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»With regard 
      to the wording in German on the drawing 590/1103 to which you refer in your 
      fax of 20 February 1995, I have learned that Bureau Veritas inserted the 
      wording just to clarify that the approval of Bureau Veritas did only concern 
      the parts of the construction that were covered by the rules of Bureau Veritas 
      then applicable in 1979 and that Bureau Veritas made the remark on the drawings 
      in order to remove doubts and to direct the attention of the shipyard and 
      the Finnish authorities to the fact that the locking devices were to be 
      considered and approved by the Finnish authorities. Accordingly, Bureau 
      Veritas approved the drawings to the extent the arrangements were generally 
      complying with the Bureau Veritas rules, but wanted to draw the attention 
      of the shipyard and the Finnish authorities to the fact, that Bureau Veritas 
      could not approve something, i.e. the locking devices, which were not specifically 
      covered by Bureau Veritas' rules of 1979.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    by the remark quoted above in their letter to the JAIC of 10.01.95, as well 
    as by the comments of Bengt-Åke Johnson, that B.V. wants to create the impression 
    that the final approval of the locking devices is the responsibility of the 
    National Maritime Administration, i.e. the F.B.N., because they issue the 
    Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a result of this 
    investigation it has to concluded that this is wrong because</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Rule 3 of 
      the 1977 B.V. Rules requires, among others, that "Doors ... have to be firmly 
      secured by use of cleats conventionally spaced or other similar devices." 
      It reveals from the B.V. letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank"> 
      Enclosure 2.4.3.37</a> - that cleats = cleating = locking devices consequently 
      the locking devices of the bow door = visor were part of the B.V. approval; 
      <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) B.V. 
      had anyway to carry out the approval even if it would have been the responsibility 
      of the F.B.N., because it was a "structural matter" which B.V. had to carry 
      out on behalf of F.B.N. due to the respective contract between the organisations. 
      - See also Subchapter 2.4.4.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    above is confirmed by the acting of B.V. surveyor Lohmann as well as by the 
    statement of the principal surveyor of the B.V. Stockholm office, Lars-Olof 
    Ålander, according to which he felt responsible for the locking devices and 
    sensors. - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.1.134.htm" target="_blank">See Enclosure 
    9.1.134.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Futhermore the B.V. 
    head office was asked to explain by what means, for example, could a plan 
    approver make sure that a "door", i.e. bow visor, would be "firmly secured 
    by use of cleats", i.e. locking devices, dimensioned as per drawing which 
    he is asked to approve? The answer was that B.V. relied on the design office 
    (von Tell AB) and the Yard, respectively their calculations, but made no own 
    calculations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that the 
    relevant drawings were approved on basis of the von Tell AB calculations carried 
    out according to the Lloyd's Register requirements, the result of which was 
    submitted to BV-Hamburg by telex of 18.03.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.23</a>). The Yard carried out own calculations with about the same result. 
    Consequently both the Yard and its subcontractor individually performed calculations, 
    whilst B.V. and F.B.N. did not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The B.V. head office 
    was further asked by what means did the B.V. surveyor on site make sure that 
    the Yard/von Tell installed locking devices according to the approved drawings. 
    The answer: »By random inspections.«</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon request of 
    the B.V. head office after the ESTONIA catastrophe the senior B.V. surveyor 
    G.Lohmann wrote down the remarks made in his notebook during the newbuilding 
    phase in relation to the bow visor (with English translation made by himself 
    indicating what he would like to have noted) - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.3.38</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Actually the only 
    notes he made in respect of the bow visor were:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>28.03.80 -</b><br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Bugklappenanschluß 
      an Hinterkante"</i> by G.Lo., i.e. "Connection of bow visor to aft part" 
      but was translated by Lohmann with:<br>
      <i>"Inspection of hull construction according to the remarks made on drawings 
      of Messrs. Tell during approval." </i>The only von Tell drawing he could 
      have had by then was 49111-330 - "General Arrangement of Bow Visor and Bow 
      Ramp" which shows details of the bow ramp hinges only. Actually it has to 
      be assumed that the remark in the notebook: "Connection of bow visor to

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both surveyors - 
    G.Lohmann and J.Drazenowic - were then the Oldenburg Field office of B.V..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the signed statement 
    of G.Lohmann made to this 'Group of Experts' has not been returned by B.V. 
    and thus cannot be made an enclosure to this report, his career and involvement 
    in Meyer Werft newbuildings including VIKING SALLY shall be outlined as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Günther Lohmann was 
    born in 1929 and started his professional career in 1944 as shipbuilding apprentice 
    with HDW-Hamburg and stayed with this yard until 1956. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 01.05.1956 he 
    started as consulting engineer with engineer H. Rössler VD at Oldenburg and 
    carried out newbuilding inspection and superintendent work for various owners, 
    also non-exclusive surveyor work for B.V. (expert adjoint N.E.) until end 
    of December 1976. From 01.01.1977 he was senior surveyor and exclusive surveyor 
    for B.V. in charge, i.e. responsible, for the Oldenburg office. His district 
    extended from Cuxhaven to Bodenwerder and to the Dutch border, i.e. the Meyer 
    Werft in Papenburg belonged to his area. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He remained in this 
    position until the end of March 1994, whereafter he retired, however, was 
    recommissioned shortly afterwards as a field surveyor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his capacity 
    as senior surveyor of the BV-Oldenburg office he supervised to a varying extent 
    the newbuildings APOLLO, DIANA, VIKING 1, 3, 4 & 5, DIANA II, and VIKING SALLY 
    on behalf of Bureau Veritas. Over the years he developed a very good relationship 
    to the responsible people of the Meyer Werft. This included for example the 
    work force who used to consult him whenever they had technical questions to 
    make matters acceptable to class. He also had close contact with representatives 
    of the National Authorities as well as owners' representatives who, as far 
    as VIKING SALLY is concerned, were members of the Johansson family, Captain 
    Brunström, and chief engineer Lars Karlsson.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> His main duties 
    were to make sure that the vessels were built according to the approved drawings 
    in relation to the rules and in accordance with sound workmanship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In line with these 
    activities he had also carefully inspected the construction of the bow visor 
    of VIKING SALLY, its installation, fitting of hinges, and welding of bushings. 
    Furthermore, he did attend the watertightness test before and during trials. 
    He recalls having been in the inner side of the visor during trials out in 
    the North Sea together with the von Tell representative, somebody from the 
    owners and also from the Yard, when it was discovered at full speed that some 
    water was leaking through the rubber packings. Consequently local adjustments 
    of the rubber packings were considered necessary and were made after the return 
    to Emden, whereafter a hose-test confirmed watertightness of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He has been shown 
    various pictures of the visor hinges with severe burning marks as found after 
    the casualty and confirmed that what is visible on the pictures would never 
    have been accepted by him, because it does not conform to the standard workmanship 
    of the Meyer Werft, and further, is not in agreement with what he had seen. 
    This also relates to the visor lug. The vessel would never have left the Yard 
    in this condition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He drew attention 
    to the fact that at the same time when VIKING SALLY was under construction 
    the yard was also building tanks for gas tankers which he also inspected on 
    behalf of B.V., in particular the welding seams, where the requirements are 
    very strict. Frequently the same welders were working on VIKING SALLY as well 
    as on the gas tanks. Therefore, he was known to have the tendency to overstress 
    his requirements as to the quality of welding seams in general. He was sometimes 
    criticised for applying the same standard when checking the quality of the 
    welding seams for gas tanks and normal vessels such as VIKING SALLY.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the Atlantic 
    lock he stated the same as he did above in respect of the hinges: The welding 
    seams visible on the pictures shown to him would never have been accepted 
    by him, because they do not conform to the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft 
    which he did survey.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary, senior 
    surveyor G.Lohmann and his assistant J.Drazenowic did carry out the newbuilding 
    supervision, apparently as required and as necessary in good co-operation 
    with yard workers, F.B.N. inspectors, and subcontractors, e.g. G.Todsen and 
    H.Brandt representing von Tell AG. Reportedly they made sure by random checking 
    that the vessel was built in accordance with the approved drawings, the requirements 
    of the rules and the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Yard, as well 
    as von Tell, were sending 4 copies of each drawing to be approved to BV-Hamburg 
    of which</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 was returned 
      with approval<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent 
      to head office Paris<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent 
      to Oldenburg office <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was kept 
      in Hamburg office </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the B.V. surveyors 
    were at the yard practically every day where they had their own office they 
    also received drawings directly from the yard before these drawings were received 
    from BV-Hamburg with the approval stamp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the fact that 
    during the first weeks after contract signing it was generally assumed that 
    the entire foreship area would be more or less identical to DIANA II lots 
    of drawings were just copied and marked 590. This refers also to drawing 1106 
    - Interlock of Bow Visor - which shows the visor hinge construction on both 
    sides of visor and vessel including the hinge plates. Also this drawing was 
    taken over from DIANA II, consequently showed the hinge plate construction 
    as installed on board this vessel, i.e. with 4 hinge plates each side on the 
    vessel, each being 30 mm thick, i.e. in total 120 mm, with fixed bolts. (See 
    attached photo showing DIANA II - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.40.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.40</a>) The drawing 1106 showing the above explained DIANA II construction 
    was sent to BV-Hamburg for approval by letter of 07.11.79. Due to owners' 
    wishes and with the consent of the B.V. surveyor, this hinge plate design 
    was changed in December 1979 from 4 to 2 hinge plates of 60 mm thickness each, 
    and the fixed bolts were changed to the floating-bolts system. In consequence 
    the total thickness of 120 mm (initially 4 x 30 mm, subsequently 2 x 60 mm) 
    remained unchanged (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.41.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.41</a>). Drawing 1106 and the respective detail drawings for production 
    were changed on 02.01.80 as per <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.42.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.42. </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The revised drawing 
    1106 was sent by letter of 09.01.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.43.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.43</a>) to von Tell GmbH for approval and the same day to BV-Hamburg 
    for approval (Enclosure 2.4.3.44). Moreover the drawing was also handed over 
    to Lohmann at the yard. The drawing was returned by von Tell already by letter 
    of 15.01.80 without comments, i.e. approved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. returned the 
    approved drawing 1106 only on 30.06.80 (approval date 20.06.80), but the approved 
    drawing was the one sent on 07.11.79 for approval with the DIANA II version 
    of hinge plates. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed 
    that upon return of the approved drawing 1106 - at a time when the vessel 
    had been fully accepted by the class, was delivered to owners and had left 
    for the Baltic already - the yard just looked for the approval and put the 
    drawing into the archive not noting that it was the wrong one which had been 
    approved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">What happened inside 
    the B.V. organisation is unknown to this 'Group of Experts', however, it is 
    a fact that the B.V. surveyors at the yard were provided with a continuous 
    stream of new drawings simultaneously with the drawings being sent to BV-Hamburg 
    or elsewhere. Therefore, this 'Group of Experts' concludes that senior surveyor 
    G.Lohmann must have had drawing 1106 in the VIKING SALLY version, latest when 
    he inspected the "connection of the visor to the vessel" on 28.03.80 according 
    to his notebook (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.38</a>) because there can be no doubt that a senior surveyor with the 
    experience of G.Lohmann would have noted at once that there were just 2 instead 
    of 4 hinge plates at each of the hinges unless he was aware of the changes 
    and had the corrected drawing at hand.</font></p>

    is made to the letter of B.V. of 10.01.95 to the JAIC (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

      the Finnish Authorities against the new IMO requirements.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is denied by 
    the Finnish Authorities, i.e. the F.B.N., because in their opinion the locking 
    devices of the visors are not their responsibility, but have to be looked 
    after by the Classification Society (which was confirmed by the retired principal 
    surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office - Lars Olof Ålander - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.44.2</a>). This will be discussed in more detail in Subchapter 2.4.4. 
    B.V. further discusses in their letter of 10.01.95 the <i>"Bow door cleating 
    and monitoring arrangements" </i>and remarks with regard to the manual side 
    locks: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2 manually 
      operated fasteners for heavy weather with limit switches on bolts (open 
      and closed position).«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since it was confirmed 
    by ESTONIA's 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür in his statement dated 03.10.94 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.183</a> - and also by the system engineer Henrik Sillaste and the motorman 
    Tanel Moosaar during their interview on 10.03.95 -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.4.278.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 21.2.4.278 </a>- that it was the boatswain's duty to close these 
    manual side locks whenever heavy weather was forecasted, it has to be assumed 
    that this was common knowledge to both crews of ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The statement of 
    B.V., that these manually operated fasteners were connected to limit switches, 
    however, does not refer to the newbuilding condition when such switches were 
    not installed. It has to be assumed that B.V. either mixed up the limit switch 
    for the indication "visor closed", which is installed in way of the port manual 
    securing device or the limit switches were installed subsequently, which is 
    unlikely. Also the following statement of B.V. is partly wrong: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The overall 
      cleating was surveyable from a mimic panel (red and green lamps for each 
      cleating group) both at the local control station and on the navigating

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The overall cleating, 
    i.e. locking devices, was surveyable only from a mimic panel with red and 
    green lamps for each cleating group located in the control station (control 
    panel) on car deck behind the bow ramp but not on the navi-gating bridge. 
    The panel on the bridge just showed one red/ one green each for visor and 
    bow ramp, i.e. the green lamp went on only when the visor was closed and secured, 
    i.e. all respective limit switches had contact. The same refers to the bow 
    ramp, i.e. the ramp had to be pulled tight against the rubber packings, and 
    all 4 securing bolts had to fully engage the mating pockets and contact the 
    sensors; only then would the green lamp indicate the bow ramp being closed 
    and secured.</font></p>

  Sjöfartsstyrelsen - and newbuilding supervision -<br>

  Ship Safety Certificate </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was built 
    for the operation under Finnish flag and consequently had to comply with the 
    regulations of the National Maritime Administration, then the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation respectively Sjöfartsstyrelsen. Approval of all safety relevant 
    installations on board a vessel, in particular if required by SOLAS, as well 
    as the issuance of the respective certificates, in particular the Passenger 
    Ship Safety Certificate, fell under the responsibility of this authority. 
    SOLAS requires that the necessary surveys and inspections of ships to enforce 
    the provisions of the present Regulations shall be carried out by the authorities 
    of the country in which the ship is or will be registered. It is possible, 
    however, that these duties may be delegated to surveyors or organisations 
    recognised by the respective government which, nevertheless, remains responsible 
    for the performance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the light of this 
    possibility to delegate and the development of the National Maritime Administrations 
    of the Nordic countries after the war, i.e. also of the Finnish Board of Navigation 
    (F.B.N.), it became an established practice that the respective Classification 
    Society of a newbuilding designated for Finnish owners - in addition to their 
    original duties as Classification Society - also carried out all structure 
    related calculations and surveys and subsequently issued the respective certificates 
    on behalf of the National Administration or supplied the data on the basis 
    of which the Administration then issued the certificates. Such practice was, 
    as such, followed by most Maritime Administrations in co-operation with the 
    recognised classification societies. The co-operation is sometimes performed 
    on basis of specific contracts, e.g. Estonian National Maritime Board/Bureau 
    Veritas or just by a letter of confirmation from the National Administration 
    to the Classification Society either in general or in relation to a particular 
    vessel. With regard to the F.B.N., contracts do exist with the respective 
    Classification Society regarding this co-operation, but these contracts are 
    confidential.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the opinion of 
    F.B.N. they were not responsible in 1979/80 and are still not responsible 
    today for the calculation of load requirements of locking devices nor for 
    the SOLAS-conform location of upper extensions of collision bulkheads above 
    bulkhead deck. It is their understanding that this is the responsibility of 
    the Classification Society because both examples are related to the structure 
    of the vessel - which as such is true. Further, according to the F.B.N. it 
    had been agreed already decades ago between the Governments of the North European 
    countries that the recognised classification societies should look after all 
    structure related matters on behalf of the Maritime Administrations as otherwise 
    the Administrations would be forced to build up similar organisations with 
    respective staff, computers, etc., which the classification societies have 
    anyway, and both would have to be paid by the owners. This principal decision 
    was laid down in the Copenhagen Convention 1924 and is - according to the 
    F.B.N. - still applicable. Therefore, they relied on Bureau Veritas in 1979/80 
    to carry out the necessary considerations and calculations, also in respect 
    of SOLAS requirements, in particular with regard to the locking devices (which 
    is denied by Bureau Veritas). As proof that their interpretation is correct, 
    F.B.N. refers to the MARIELLA casualty which occurred in 1985 in their waters, 
    but they were neither informed by owners nor by the Classification Society 
    DnV, nor by the hull underwriters. The VIKING SAGA casualty in 1984 never 
    came to their knowledge until we told them, although also this was a Finnish 
    ferry in Finnish waters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> F.B.N. is convinced 
    that their attitude is correct and that they basically just take care of lifeboat, 
    fire-fighting, and navigational equipment, and leave the rest to the Classification 
    Society. They have indicated that they have written and still write "Letters 
    of Authorisation" to the Classification Societies whom they trust, e.g. to 
    B.V. The last "Letter of Authorisation" is said to have been written to B.V. 
    in 1982. Irrespective of the above, F.B.N. is aware of the fact that the ultimate 
    responsibility for SOLAS matters, including failure of their servants, i.e. 
    also class employees, rests with them. It should in this context however be 
    observed, that also in the Copenhagen Convention it is explicitly stated, 
    that the ultimate responsibility for the supervision of ships' safety matters 
    always remains with the respective National administration. </font></p>

    had to be assumed that due to the fact that the same procedure had been performed 
    one year before with the, in this respect, identical DIANA II by the Swedish

    activity of their own was required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As far as the Yard 
    is concerned it has to be assumed that von Tell had sent a copy to the Yard 
    of the approved drawing 49111-330 - General Arrangement of bow visor and ramp

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the remark just 
    referred to the "Arrangement", i.e. number and placing, and not to the "Dimensioning" 
    of the locking devices and as further it was the intention to use an identical 
    installation to that installed a year before on the near-sister vessel DIANA 
    II, which had been approved by B.V. and Sjöfartsverket, there was no reason 
    for the Yard to do anything, in particular, there was no reason to talk to 
    F.B.N.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead there is apparently no correspondence 
    between the Yard and F.B.N. This issue had been clarified beforehand between 
    the owners and F.B.N., and it was confirmed by Director Valkonen that the 
    bow ramp was considered to be the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck, although located too much forward. This was allegedly 
    permissible according to SOLAS since the intended trade would allow the vessel 
    to stay within 20 nm off the nearest land and under such conditions it was 
    within the discretion of the Maritime Administration to exempt the owners 
    from otherwise mandatory obligations. This however required the issuance of 
    an exemption certificate by F.B.N., which apparently was not done and reportedly 
    also not customary in those years (see page 84).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was agreed between 
    the Yard and owners that »bow and stern ramps' arrangement same as on DIANA

    specification, being part of the building contract, that </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»No 
    partial collision door required for the intended trade by F.B.N.«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the location 
    of the bow ramp, being the upper extension of the collision bulkhead, was 
    in line with the B.V. Rules and F.B.N. - having received all relevant drawings 
    - did not raise objections either - there was thus no reason for the Yard 
    to have doubts that this construction would not be in line with the SOLAS 
    requirements for the intended trade. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After delivery, F.B.N. 
    issued a temporary Passenger Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.55.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    2.4.4.55 </a>(Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.56.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.56</a> (English) - for the voyage from Papenburg to Mariehamn without 
    passengers, which was valid until 20 July 1980.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the vessel 
    came to Turku for the first time, the responsible F.B.N. Director H.Valkonen 
    and the F.B.N. surveyor from Kotka, Gunnar Peippo, marked on a respective 
    drawing all parts of the vessel not to be used by passengers and limited the 
    number of passengers to 700. They further stated that the 20 nm limit was 
    valid until the vessel was fully completed. At a subsequent meeting on 19.07.80 
    it was decided that the vessel was now completed and the first permanent PSSC 
    was issued - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.57.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.57</a> (Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.58.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.58</a> (English) - however, restricted to "Kustfart mellan Finland och 
    Sverige", i.e. "coastal trade between Finland and Sweden". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The PSSC was issued 
    in two different versions, i.e.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) in Finnish/Swedish 
    language which was considered to be the original. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) in English 
    language for foreigners.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The English 
    wording is to be considered as a translation only.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the PSSC the 
    F.B.N. confirmed the following:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the vessel 
    could be employed for "short international voyages" as defined in SOLAS 1974, 
    Chapter 3 - Lifesaving Appliances, etc. Regulation 2 - Definition:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Short international 
      voyage signifies an international voyage in the course of which a ship is 
      not more than 200 miles from a port or place where the passengers and crew 
      could be placed in safety, and which does not exceed 600 miles in length 
      between the last port of call in the country where the voyage begins and 
      the final port of destination.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the vessel complied 
    with <i>»the requirements of the Regulations annexed to the said Convention 
    as regards: 1. the structure ..«.</i><br>
    - the vessel may carry 2000 passengers »i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige« 
    which means translated: "in coastal trade between Finland and Sweden." Actually 
    the respective (wrong) wording in the English certificates is: »For a short 
    international voyage between Finland and Sweden«. This later led to considerable 
    confusion because in particular the media only received the English version 
    and interpreted the term "short international voyage" in this context as a 
    reference to the SOLAS regulation cited above, which is wrong. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst<i> "short 
    international voyage"</i> refers to SOLAS Chapter 3 "Lifesaving Appliances, 
    etc.", the term "Kustfart" is a trading limit defined by the F.B.N. in their 
    letter of 27 June 1995 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.59 </a>- as <i>"not south of Latitude 59°30'N"</i>, which again is wrong. 
    The term <i>"Kustfart"</i> appears only in the Finnish <i>"Statute on Officers 
    on Merchant Vessels 522/1964".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This statute governs 
    the number of and the competence of officers onboard merchant vessels. Under 
    section 2 the types of vessels are defined as well as the trading areas for 
    purposes of this statute. E.g. by the coastal trade/"kustfart" is, according 
    to section 2, item 8 understood "trade outside the inner trading area on the 
    Gulf of Finland as far as 23 degrees long, and on the Gulf of Bothnia and 
    in the Baltic up to lat. 59 degrees 30 and trading within the Swedish Archipelago 
    up to Söderköping". This statute comprises a number of general and specific 
    rules (chapters 1 and 5), and also detailed rules on the certificates of engine 
    and deck officers (chapters 2 and 3). Under chapter 4, the number of and the 
    competence of deck officers is governed. E.g., under section 24 it is in very 
    detail established what the number and competence of the deck officers onboard 
    a vessel in coastal trade (kustfart) is. However, the statute does not refer 
    to the vessel itself. The narrow scope of application of the statute is also 
    described under section 40, which stipulates what pieces of legislation are 
    cancelled by means of this new statute. Not a single statute referring to 
    the construction, seaworthiness, equipment etc. of vessels is mentioned under 
    that section. Consequently it has to be concluded that the definition "kustfart", 
    "coastal trade" as mentioned in the PSSC is actually based on section 2, item 
    8 of the "statute on ship's officers 522/1964" and that the explanation given 
    by F.B.N. in its letter signed by Mr. Jukka Häkämies (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">enclosure 
    2.4.4.59</a>) clearly refers to this same section, comprising the definition 
    of "kustfart" "as not south of latitude N 59 deg. 30 min". A similar definition 
    is not to be found in any other pieces of legislation pertaining to vessels 
    or navigation, there is not even a reference to coastal trade in such legislation. 
    This definition is not based on a possible exemption as per Chapter II, Regulation 
    1 c) of the at the time with regard to Finnish vessels applicable SOLAS 1960 
    Convention.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is another 
    matter that the F.B.N. later in the above letter, is alleging that the background 
    of "kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" would somehow be the exemption rule 
    of the SOLAS convention. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking 
    upon the application of a definition comprised in various statutes, a general 
    principle is that a certain definition is only applicable on matters regulated 
    by a law comprising that specific definition. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly, the 
    statute itself restricts the application of the definitions of that particular 
    statute solely to the scope of application of the statue itself, that is on 
    matters relating to number and competence of a vessel's officers. Therefore, 
    the restricted trading area "kustfart", "coastal trade" has only been issued 
    and it can only be used in matters relating to the number and competence of 
    the officers onboard that is in connection with matters regulated by the statute 
    of 1964. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The trading 
    area "coastal trade between Sweden and Finland" (i kustfart mellan Sverige 
    och Finland) has not been issued due to the construction of or particulars 
    affecting the construction of the vessel but solely due to the composition 
    of the crew, that is the restricted number of officers onboard. It only means 
    that when the vessel is trading in coastal trade between Sweden and Finland 
    - which it did - it has to be manned as per section 24 of the statute on ship's 
    officers. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus, the restriction 
    "coastal trade" does not relate to the construction of the vessel, however, 
    if it is assumed that this particular restriction was intended to refer to 
    the construction of the vessel, i.e. that the F.B.N. when issuing the certificate 
    would have found that the vessel was only safe in coastal trade between Sweden 
    and Finland, the conclusion would then be that the FBN should have made a 
    respective remark in the PSSC which doubtless would have led to re-inspecting 
    the vessel in case the trading area would be changed. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated in 
    Subchapter 2.2 and as it has been confirmed by the SOLAS experts of Germanischer 
    Lloyd it was common practice in those years for the National Maritime Authorities 
    not to issue "Exemption Certificates", but that a respective handwritten remark 
    by the inspector in the vessel's file was sufficient. In addition, however, 
    this remark, that the trading area was restricted to "sheltered waters - 20 
    nm", should have been made in the PSSC as well, which could have been the 
    case by the entry "i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige".<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It may thus 
    be concluded that the F.B.N. issued the PSSC - after receipt of copies of 
    the class certificates - in accordance with common practice in those years, 
    i.e. it confirmed by the PSSC that the vessel complied with the SOLAS requirements, 
    however, restricted the trade to "Kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" = "coastal 
    trade between Finland and Sweden". This should have ended, however, when the 
    issuance of "exemption certificates" became mandatory in 1985/86 and copies 
    had to be sent to IMO. At the latest then the F.B.N. should have issued an 
    "Exemption Certificate" in respect of the wrong location of the bow ramp as 
    upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck (cardeck) and 
    should have sent a copy to IMO in London as also required by SOLAS. This was 
    not done. Even when the trading area was changed to the middle of the Gulf 
    of Bothnia and the vessel's name was changed to WASA KING, the F.B.N. continued 
    to issue the same PSSC's even though the vessel had left the "sheltered waters" 
    on the leg Sundsvall-Vaasa when she was regularly more than 20 nm from the 
    nearest land, thus the granting of exemptions was no more permissible according 
    to SOLAS and the F.B.N. should have required the installation of a "partial 
    collision door" or similar in way of the proper location required by SOLAS 
    for the "the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck". 
    Also this was not done and the vessel kept sailing in the same condition as 
    delivered by her builders in 1980 and with the same worded PSSC as first issued 
    in 1980. This was the situation when the vessel was sold in January 1993.

    and electrician Lars Sjögren. He had been in Papenburg already as owners' 
    representative during the building of VIKING 3, 4 & 5, thus knew the Yard 
    as well as the people including the B.V. inspectors (all vessels were classed 
    by B.V.), spoke some German and was therefore nominated as "coordinator" of 
    owners' superintendents. He stayed until the delivery and subsequently became

      after signing of the contract I came to Papenburg together with Capt. Brunström 
      (was relieved after 5 weeks by Lars Mäkki), 1st engineer Stig Strömberg, 
      and electrician Lars Sjögren. At the beginning I had only 1 small GA plan, 
      deck and engine specifications were shown to me.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due 
      to pressure of time we had to make a lot of compromises. In my opinion and 
      experience the Meyer Werft was the only yard in Europe able to do such a 
      job because of so little bureaucracy. This has, in my opinion, nothing to 
      do with the catastrophe. Meyer Werft has very much experience. They have 
      built all ships very strong, i.e. they were usually heavy. It is a well 
      known fact that Meyer ships were stronger and behaved better in ice compared 
      to e.g. Wärtsilä ships. <br>
      With my team of supervisors I checked everything including, and in particular, 
      weldings in close co-operation with B.V. surveyor Lohmann and his colleague. 
      As far as I remember Lohmann was more active on VIKING 1-5, whilst on VIKING 
      SALLY he was the boss and the other one did the routine work. Anyway Lohmann 
      was always present when major items, such as ramp and visor, were presented 
      by the yard and tested.<br>
      My best contacts were Mr. Motikat and Mr. Wahnes. F.B.N representatives 
      came from time to time, however, all paperwork was done by the Sally office 
      in Mariehamn directly with F.B.N. Helsinki. I did some inspections with

      Lindström came about 3 months before delivery. I also inspected visor/ramp 
      etc. I checked the visor during building together with the 1st engineer. 
      It was very hectic during the last days before launching because there were 
      delays in delivery of equipment from Sweden due to a strike in this country. 
      After launching the visor was lifted ashore again. It was before only welded 
      to the vessel by steel-bars. At present I do not remember details of the 
      bearing/bushing system of visor hinges. <br>

      moved and had also zoom ability. Monitors were on the bridge (located at 
      port side of the entrance to the chart room) and in the engine control room 
      (ECR) above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor 
      could be changed to another camera either manually or automatically. The

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In detail: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) - The Bow Visor 
    was built in the fabrication hall according to drawings of Messrs. von Tell 
    AB, Gothenburg in the same way as already one year before the visor for DIANA 
    II had been built. It was moved out of the hall into the open on 15.01.80 
    and remained there until it was fitted to the vessel between 01.03. and 15.3.80. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the 
    time the visor was in the open air storage the hinge plates to be fitted to 
    the visor arms and at the forecastle deck were fabricated and the following 
    line of production developed:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 1:10 shop: 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the 
    original drawings, 1:10 scaled "burning sketches" were made and fed into the 
    photo electric scanner steering the cutting machine, which subsequently cut 
    out lugs for Atlantic lock, hinge plates and side locks, which thereafter 
    were transported to the locksmith shop. Atlantic lock lugs were 15 mm respectively 
    60 mm in diameter, side locks and hinge plates were 60 mm thick. All parts 
    subsequently to be welded to vessel's structure were oversized in length. 
    The colour of the basic primer was yellow as can be seen from the photos attached 
    as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 2.4.6.63.</a><br>

    diameters according to drawings supplied were drilled into lugs and hinge 
    plates whereafter the parts were transported to the visor. - Welding of hinge 
    plates: The hinge plates were welded to the visor. During the welding procedure 
    its proper alignment was assured by the use of a pipe prepared specifically 
    for this purpose having the exact diameter of the hinge plate bores. One photo 
    shows the visor in open air with hinge plates already fitted (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Hinge system 
    made fit for functioning by cutting the hinge plates for vessel's side to 
    the required length, welding hinge plates to forecastle deck after proper 
    alignment had been ascertained by the use of the above-mentioned pipe tool. 
    Welding of steel bushings into the bores of the visor's hinge plates always 
    assuring proper alignment by means of the pipe tool, finally shrinking the 
    bronze bushings into the steel bushings, fitting in the Nirosta bolts and 
    fixing the securing plates. The visor hinge system is explained by the drawing 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.66.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.6.66.</a> <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The von Tell 
    representative G.Todsen had supervised and controlled the Yard's work with 
    parts delivered by von Tell and with parts fabricated by the Yard according 
    to von Tell drawings. He also assisted whenever required. This refers in particular 
    to the installation of safety relevant parts, such as the hinges, the locking 
    devices, the lifting cylinders, and rubber packings. In detail the activities 
    of G.Todsen have been explained in his statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The installation 
    of the visor hinges have been carried out - according to Todsen - as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Installation of 
      Hinges The bore holes for the bushings were made by means of a boring mill 
      in the fabrication hall. I personally took a close look at the bore holes 
      and touched them with my fingers before the bushings were installed and 
      can confirm that by no means were they burned holes. I would never have 
      accepted such dubbed work as can be seen on the photographs shown to me 
      of the remnants of ESTONIA's hinge plate. In case the yard would not have 
      taken notice of my objections, I would have left the ship and would have 
      informed my principals accordingly.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Under my 
      supervision on board the steel bushings were welded into the visor's arms 
      and subsequently bored out to the extent that the bronze bushings did fit. 
      These bores were carried out with extreme precision in order that port side 
      and starboard side were in alignment in order to avoid breaking tension 
      when opening resp. closing of the visor. Subsequently the bolts were guided 
      in whilst simultaneously the distance rings (2 mm thickness) were fitted. 
      I recall this work especially because it was rather fumbly work. The bolts 
      were made of Nirosta steel and had a grease groove with grease nipple. By 
      means of theses grease nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once 
      a week by grease gun.«</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The Lifting 
    Cylinders (actuators) were also supplied by von Tell and installed under the 
    supervision and upon instructions of G.Todsen. Thereby the same care was applied 
    as had been done with the installation of the hinges. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) The Atlantic 
    Lock was also of von Tell design and mainly also supply. The Yard fabricated 
    only the 3 steel lugs at vessel's side plus the visor lug and carried out 
    the installation under the supervision of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. 
    The von Tell supply can be taken in detail from drawing 49111-373 - Atlantic 
    Lock - to be found in the "Drawing file". The yard performed as follows</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">:<br>
    The lugs of the Atlantic lock were cut out according to the respective burning 
    sketches in the 1:10 shop. The thickness of the 3 lugs to be welded to the 
    forepeak deck were 15 mm each and the visor lug was 60 mm. The parts subsequently 
    to be welded to vessel's structure were oversized. Thereafter the lugs were 
    transported to the locksmith shop, where the holes were drilled into the lugs 
    according to the relevant drawings and were subsequently transported to the 
    welders shop. Here one support bushing was welded into the starboard lug, 
    whilst the centre and port lugs were connected by another bushing, called 
    "bolt housing" by the JAIC, which was welded into the holes of both lugs.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both bushings 
    were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both sides in accordance 
    with yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings whilst the lugs 
    were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the von Tell representative 
    G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he never would have accepted the 3 
    mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains of the Atlantic lugs. 
    In this connection G.Todsen explains (see his Statement -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.2.21</a>):</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The three 
      lugs, welded to the A-deck, as well as the lug at the aft part of the visor's 
      bottom are yard-supply. The 3 first mentioned lugs had been constructed 
      with overmeasure. It can be seen from the respective drawing that both bushings, 
      the bolt, the cylinder including piston rod, and the limit switches (sensors) 
      had been delivered by von Tell. The lug of the visor was welded and used 
      as fixing point for the alignment of the other three lugs of the Atlantic 
      lock. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 
      the workshop both bushings had been welded into the lugs in such a way that 
      the large bushing fitted between the middle and the port lug and the small 
      bushing into the starboard lug with the support bracket. As already mentioned 
      above, I have had detail drawings for all components from which among others 
      also the thickness of the welding seams were revealed.<br>
      The installation of the Atlantic lock was carried out as follows when the 
      visor was closed:<br>
      - The fixing point was the lug of the visor, <br>
      - accordingly hydraulic cylinder and the 3 lugs with already previously 
      welded bushings were aligned, burned to fit and welded.<br>
      Thereby I paid special attention to the even welding of the 3 lugs to the 
      A-deck, i.e. inner and outer side the same. Furthermore, I took care that 
      below each lug, in the void space under A-deck, a reinforcement was fitted.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) The Side Locks 
    were of similar design and construction as the Atlantic Lock, with all components 
    supplied by von Tell and the Yard only fabricating the steel parts and performing 
    the installation under the supervision of von Tell. This was carried out as 
    follows:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was 
    closed and the required length of the lugs measured, the lugs cut respectively. 
    Location of lugs was marked at both bulkheads, the visor partly opened, and 
    the lugs welded on to the bulkheads. Thereafter the cleats of the manual locks 
    were also welded to the bulkheads. Flat bars welded at the inner side of the 
    bulkheads according to class surveyor's requirements and under supervision 
    and control of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) The Rubber Packings 
    were installed on the forepeak deck to assure weathertightness of the visor 
    and a firm and tight connection between visor and vessel once the locking 
    devices were closed. By this tight connection high frequency vibration of 
    the visor with respective effects on its fixing points were avoided. In this 
    connection G.Todsen explains:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Prior to installing 
      the 50 mm thick rubber gaskets every 300 - 400 mm the distance between the 
      opposite parts visor/ship were measured by means of an inside calliper and 
      the deviations ascertained were compensated by flat iron. This way guaranteed 
      that the rubber gaskets installed afterwards had absolutely the same contact 
      pressure, as the visor was pressed into the rubber gaskets up to 8-10 mm, 
      which made the inside of the visor watertight (weathertight).<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During 
      the trial trip to Helgoland, among other things also the visor was checked 
      in respect of its tightness. The visor was totally locked, i.e. also the 
      manual locking devices were closed.<br>
      During full speed - i.e. about 2,5 m high bow wave and slightly pitching 
      vessel - myself, Mr. Lohmann, surveyor of Bureau Veritas, and a representative 
      of the owners, whose name I do not remember, were inside the visor and noted 
      that the visor was not totally watertight, but at some places water was 
      slightly leaking through. After returning to Emden the rubber packings were 
      marked with chalk, the visor was closed and opened again. Due to the remaining 
      imprints the leakings were found out and the rubber packings were raised 
      in these particular areas. During a subsequent tightness test the visor 
      was found to be tight and finally accepted by the owners, the Classification 
      Society and the Finnish Board of Navigation.<br>
      The official delivery took place already on 20 June 1980 - after successful 
      function test on 19 June 1980. Afterwards the attached Delivery Certificate 
      was filled in and signed by representatives of the owners, the B.V., the 
      shipyard and my colleague Brandt.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. surveyor Lohmann 
    also remembers that during trials some minor leakage was noted. He also remembers 
    that after return to Emden the respective rubber packings were adjusted and 
    a subsequent test revealed the visor to be watertight i.e. weathertight in 
    SOLAS terminology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (f) The Bow Ramp 
    was also installed under the control and supervision and with the assistance 
    of G.Todsen. His comments are:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The bow ramp 
      as well had been installed and arranged under my supervision. The securing 
      bolts were made to fit. During locking of the ramp at first each one hook 
      on each side of the corresponding parts of the ramp lowered and pulled the 
      ramp inwards, up until a special point had been reached and passed. Now 
      the ramp was tight in position. Then two bolts on each side moved out of 
      the ship into the corresponding pockets of the ramp.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      bolts snapped audibly into their end positions. As from the control console 
      on the car deck neither visor nor ramp locking devices could be seen, the 
      operator had to rely on the control lamps and his sense of hearing. It was 
      clearly audible by the snapping noises when the bolts engaged the pockets. 
      Only after the bolts had fully engaged did the sensors become activated, 
      which - if all bolts and also the hooks were in contact with the sensors 
      - led to the "green light" at the control console as well as on the bridge, 
      i.e. the ramp was closed and locked.« </font></i></p>

  The hull and deck arrangement</font></b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hull was built 
    to Bureau Veritas rules and to the Load Line and SOLAS Conventions regarding 
    watertight subdivision. It was designed with a slender forebody extending 
    into a bulbous bow and a "pram type" afterbody with two propellers and two 
    rudders. Two bow thrusters were installed. The afterbody was modified during 
    drydocking in 1985 by a "duck tail" extension giving increased buoyancy in 
    the afterbody and a better hydrodynamic flow condition, preventing the stern 
    from setting down at high speed. This was a problem in the original configuration 
    unless forward located ballast tanks were filled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The forebody had 
    an extensive "flare", especially below the knuckle line at the car deck level. 
    Such flares were increasingly applied at the time to provide full width of 
    the car deck and accommodation area as far forward as possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An active roll-stabilising 
    system with fins was installed in January 1994. Provisions for such installation 
    had been made already at the newbuilding stage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hull below the 
    bulkhead deck was subdivided by fifteen watertight transverse bulkheads, equipped 
    with watertight doors as required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The double-bottom 
    spaces were arranged for fuel oils and other liquids and some were designated 
    as empty tanks. Fuel oil tanks were also placed above the inner bottom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 0, the tank 
    deck, contained : from forward - the forepeak, the bow thruster room, an extensive 
    sauna and swimming pool area, and in the aft half of the ship - the generator 
    room, the engine room, the fuel purifier room and other machinery-related 
    spaces. The deck next above, deck 1, contained - in the forward half - economy 
    class cabins for 358 passengers. The aft half of the deck contained the engine 
    control room, workshop, main engine room and various utility spaces. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car deck was 
    one open space, with the exception of a centre casing, located slightly to 
    starboard. Loading ramps were arranged one at the forward end and two at the 
    aft end of the deck. The centre casing contained staircases from the spaces 
    below the car deck, lift trunks and various utility spaces for machinery and 
    catering functions. Five lifts were installed, extending from the passenger 
    spaces below the car deck and from the car deck to deck number 7. Six sets 
    of stairs led from the lower passenger spaces to a common passageway inside 
    the casing.Four sets of stairs led from this passageway to deck 4 and six 
    sets led upwards to higher decks. Stairs were also arranged at the aft open-air 
    deck spaces from deck 4 upwards to deck 8. Emergency escape trunks from the 
    engine room area were arranged inside the casing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Smaller service spaces 
    for power supply to the ramp and bow visor operation and the hoistable car 
    decks were arranged on the car deck port and starboard, forward and aft. An 
    office for the cargo officer during loading and discharging was arranged in 
    the aft service space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 4 contained 
    many passenger cabins and, aft, conference rooms, a cafeteria and passenger 
    seats. The enclosed deck area ended at two public exits to the open-air aft 
    deck. Decks 5 and 6 had passenger cabins covering the forward third and the 
    remaining parts were used for tax free shop, information desk, restaurants, 
    bars and entertainment areas. Both decks had two double-door public exits 
    to the open-air aft decks. The accommodation spaces on decks 4, 5 and 6 extended 
    from side to side without any open-air passage or other open-air spaces except 
    the aft decks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 7 contained 
    the main part of the crew accommodation. This deck did not extend to the sides 
    of the vessel, giving room for an open deck area on both sides. On the open 
    deck there were the rescue stations and the embarkation area for lifeboats. 
    The deck was accessible to passengers via two main staircases and between 
    the aft open-air decks. The passageways contained cradles for liferafts and 
    bins for lifejackets for passengers and crew. Forward on deck 8 was accommodation 
    for the senior officers and, aft, additional crew accommodation spaces. The 
    intermediate space was taken up by ventilation equipment and other service 
    functions. The lifeboat davits and additional liferaft bins were located at 
    the sides of this deck. Deck 8 was accessible to passengers only via external 
    stairs from deck 7.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The navigation bridge 
    was on deck 9. </font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.3 Propulsion system and 
  control</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The propulsion system consisted 
  of four medium-speed diesel engines, connected in pairs to two propeller shafts 
  via gear boxes. The engines were four-stroke turbo-charged engines with eight 
  cylinders and a maximum continuous output of 4 400 kW each. They were designed 
  to operate on heavy fuel oil. Maximum continuous operating revolutions of the 
  engines were 600 rpm which corresponded to 188 rpm of the propellers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Each propeller shaft carried 
  one controllable-pitch propeller with a diameter of 4.0 m. The port-side propeller 
  rotated clockwise and the starboard side one counter-clockwise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The pitch control of the propellers 
  was hydraulic, separate for each propeller. The control was effected electrically 
  be power selector levers on the main control console on the bridge, on the bridge 
  wings and in the engine control room. The control signal from the power selector 
  affected the engine revolutions as well as the propeller pitch via an electro-hydraulic 
  "combinator". Revolutions and pitch both increased at increasing power settings 
  up to about 70% output, when the maximum continuous engine revolutions, i.e. 
  800 rpm were reached. After that, the output could be further increased to 90% 
  by increasing the propeller pitch only while the revolutions of the engines 
  remained at 600 rpm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">All the normal indicators, alarms 
  and control devices were on the bridge and in the engine control room. The installation 
  qualified for unmanned machinery space at sea in accordance with the classification 
  requirements, but actual operation was at all times conducted with the engine 
  control room manned by one engineer and one motorman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The total fuel oil tank capacity 
  was 940 m³ of heavy fuel oil and 291 m³ of marine diesel oil. Bunkering for 
  a complete round trip was always done in Stockholm. </font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The three-phase, 380 V, 50 
  Hz electrical system was fed by four main electrical generator sets. They had 
  an output of 1065 kVA each and were capable of parallel operation. The generators 
  were driven by four diesel engines, each supplying 1104 kW at 750 rpm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">Transformers provided 220 V 
  single-phase power for lighting and utility functions. The main electrical switchboard 
  was in the engine control room. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">An emergency generator set in 
  compliance with the SOLAS requirements was installed in a separate room on deck 
  8 near the engine casing. The generator was powered by a diesel engine with 
  an output of 312 kW at 1500 rpm. It supplied the emergency lighting system and 
  also essential bridge equipment, including engine control, steering system, 
  radars, gyro-compass, logs, echo-sounder, navigation lights, search lights, 
  radio station, telephone system and public address system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The emergency generator unit 
  was designed to start automatically in case of loss of electrical power in the 
  main network. The total starting and switch-in time was about 15 seconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Accumulators for emergency

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Two centrifugal 
  ballast pumps were installed, each with a capacity of 300 m³/h. The pumps served 
  ballast tanks which were the forepeak tank, the forward trim tank, two double-bottom 
  tanks, one pair of heeling tanks and the aft peak tank, giving a total capacity 
  of 1212 m³.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The heeling tanks 
  were side tanks with a capacity of 183 m³ each and intended for adjusting a 
  list of the vessel when needed. The list that could be compensated with one 
  heeling tank full and the other empty was about eight degrees. A separate heeling 
  tank pump could be operated from the deck office at the stern ramp and from 
  the engine control room. The connection valve between the heeling tanks (cross-flooding 
  valve) was designed to close in case of failure of electrical power. The open/close 
  condition of this valve was indicated by red/green lights on the control panel 
  for the watertight doors on the bridge. - See photo below. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.6 Car deck 
  arrangement</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The vessel had 
  a deck for loading trucks, cars and other wheeled cargo. The car deck was the 
  vessel's freeboard deck and identified as deck number 2. It extended from side 
  to side and from bow to stern, with a centre casing immediately starboard of 
  the centre line. The available deck space was divided into four lanes on the 
  port side and three on the starboard side. Lashing fittings were mounted along 
  the lanes on the car deck.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Personnel access 
  to the car deck was via stairs and lifts in the centre casing. Four of the lifts 
  had doors leading to the starboard side of the car deck and one had doors to 
  the port side. A total of eleven doors, six starboard and five port, led from 
  the car deck to the stairs inside the casing. The doors were sliding-type steel 
  doors, meeting the SOLAS fire resistance requirements. The locks of the doors 
  were remotely operated from the Information desk on deck 5. The doors were not 
  locked at sea. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The car deck space 
  was ventilated by electrically driven fans, located on both sides at the forward 
  and aft ends of the deck area. The air channels ended at the open deck 4, on 
  the forecastle deck level in the front bulkhead of the superstructure.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Twelve closable 
  4" scuppers were installed along each side of the deck. The scuppers were normally 
  left open.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Four TV cameras 
  for monitoring the car deck area were mounted. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.7 Bridge 
  layout</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The navigation 
  bridge was on the uppermost deck (deck 9), 9.2 m aft of the forward end of the 
  superstructure. The bridge wings extended over the ship's sides by about 1.5 
  m and were fully enclosed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The central part 
  of the bridge extended forward of the wings by about 2 m. In the original design 
  there was a console containing all major navigation and control equipment at 
  the front bulkhead, just below the windows. The steering console was located 
  on the centre line, just behind the front windows. The bridge was rebuilt in 
  January 1994 and some of the navigation equipment was renewed. The navigation 
  console at the front bulkhead was partly removed, and a new conning station 
  was installed to port of the centre-line. The design of the conning station 
  was of the Pilot-Copilot type, commonly used in Baltic ferries.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The new console 
  contained two ARPA radars, DGP's (Differential Global Positioning System) receivers, 
  the main auto-pilot, propulsion control levers, VHF telephones, mobile telephones 
  and equipment for internal communications. From the two navigators' seats, and 
  the captain's seat, normally placed to the port of the conning console, the 
  panel with indicator lamps for visor and ramp was within sight.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The fin stabilisers 
  and associated controls were also installed in 1994. The original "Roll-Nix" 
  stabilisation system had been found inadequate. It was, however, not removed 
  and had sometimes been used in strong following wind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> A separate chartroom 
  was located on the starboard side, in the aft part of the bridge. The corresponding 
  space on the port side was an open area containing the fire alarm centre and 
  various cabinets for storage, etc. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The main entrance 
  to the bridge, from the accommodation, was on the centre line at the aft end 
  of the bridge, where a door to the staircase connected the bridge with the officer 
  and crew accommodation on decks 8 and 7. On the port side at the aft end of 
  the bridge there was a door to the open deck.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Because of the 
  retracted position of the navigation bridge, only the flag pole on the bow of 
  the vessel was visible from the conning station - see drawing below - whilst 
  the most forward part of the visor could be seen through the two windows on 
  deck level at both sides of the extended central part of the bridge, as can 
  be seen on the drawing below. A monitor, showing among other things, the transmissions 
  from the four car-deck cameras, was placed at the chartroom entrance and could 
  not be seen from the conning station. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The visor 
    and ramp installations of the ESTONIA were of a configuration common on ferries 
    in traffic between Finland and Sweden at the time of her construction. The 
    installations comprised an upward-opening bow visor and a loading ramp at 
    the bow and two loading ramps at the stern, which were hinged at car deck 
    level and closed when raised.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position, 
    the upper end of the bow ramp extended into a box-like housing on the deck 
    of the visor, the ramp house. The complete bow ramp and the operating and 
    locking devices for the visor as well as the stern ramps and the hanging decks 
    were designed and delivered by an independent company, von Tell Trading & 
    Co. AB, Gothenburg (hereafter called von Tell AB), an established supplier 
    of hydraulically operated ship's installations. The design was based on a 
    detailed specification by the shipyard. Von Tell AB used a subcontractor, 
    Grimmereds Verkstads AB, Gothenburg for manufacturing complete sets of components 
    for the ramps, the hanging decks and the locking devices, including those 
    for the visor. The routine contacts between the Yard and the supplier were 
    via von Tell GmbH, Hamburg, a subsidiary of von Tell AB. Incorporation of 
    the system into the ship and manufacture of the attachment structure were 
    shipyard work, although under the supervision of a von Tell representative. 
    See Subchapter 2.4.2. The equipment delivered by von Tell was identical to 
    that built for the preceding newbuilding, DIANA II, except for the slightly 
    increased length of the bow ramp and the changes of the car platforms dictated 
    by the greater length of the vessel. According to available information the 
    visor operating and locking system for DIANA II was designed by von Tell AB 
    staff who had experience with similar installations from their previous employments. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Bureau Veritas 
    rules valid at the time had no details regarding procedures for calculating 
    sea loads on the bow visor. It was stated in general wording "that doors should 
    be firmly secured and that structural reinforcements should be made to attachment 
    points of cleats, hinges and jacks". The general wording in the rules also 
    specified that the scantlings for the visor structure should be equivalent 
    to that of the hull itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vertical and 
    longitudinal sea loads to which the bow visor could be exposed were calculated 
    separately by the Yard and by von Tell AB. The Bureau Veritas rules gave no 
    detailed guidance for such calculations. The Yard therefore used for this 
    purpose the nominal "pressure heights" given by Bureau Veritas in the Note 
    Documentaire BM2 of 05.04.1976, which was originally issued as a general guidance 
    for determining the loads on the bows of large ships, whilst von Tell AB used 
    nominal pressure heads per unit of projected area specified in the rules of 
    Lloyd's Register Shipping, valid at the time ESTONIA was under construction.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b>The Visor 
    Construction and Functioning</b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was a 
    Ro-Ro passenger ferry with visor, bow ramp and stern ramps. The visor was 
    the most forward part of the vessel and pivoted around 2 hinges fitted at 
    the forecastle deck, i.e. C-deck, having its opening and closing move-ments 
    performed by 2 hydraulic lifting cylinders (actuators). The construction of 
    the visor corresponded to the construction of the bow with material dimensioned 
    according to the general requirements of the Classification Society (for details 
    see Subchapter 2.4.3). The lower forward part was ice-strengthened. The visor 
    consisted mainly of shell plating being an extension of the ship's shell plating 
    and contour, the forecastle deck, the bottom part, the 2 aft bulkheads, the 
    3 horizontal stringers with the 5 bow pointers in between respectively on 
    top of the 2 vertical partial bulkheads and transverse stiffeners. The two 
    so-called visor arms (beams) extended about 3 m aft of the visor and ended 
    in the two hinge arrangements by which the visor was connected to the vessel 
    and which were the pivoting parts as well. The design weight of the visor 
    was about 55 mts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Between the two 
    visor arms a box-shaped housing - the so-called ramp house - was fitted into 
    which the upper end of the bow ramp extended in closed position. This was 
    the interlock between visor and bow ramp, a configuration quite common at 
    the time VIKING SALLY was designed and built (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.67.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.6.2.67</a> - photo VIKING SALLY). In closed position the visor 
    was connected to the foreship by three hydraulically operated locking devices. 
    One of these locking devices - the "Atlantic lock" - was mounted on the forepeak 
    deck - A-deck - whilst the other 2 were side locks mounted in the front bulkheads 
    of the vessel with the mating lugs at the lower parts of the aft bulkheads 
    of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, there 
    were 2 mechanical locking devices - the so-called manual side locks - mounted 
    on both sides below the hydraulic side locks. The manual side locks were - 
    according to Bureau Veritas - "Heavy Weather Securings" (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.37</a> - letter B.V. to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.75</a> - photo showing mock-up of the manual side lock). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Three strong locating 
    horns - one on the forepeak deck called "pyramid" and one at each front bulkhead 
    of the vessel - engaged recesses in the visor bottom respectively on both 
    aft bulkheads of the visor when in closed position and were intended to absorb 
    lateral loads.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position 
    the visor bottom rested on the forepeak deck mainly in way of the strong stempost 
    which took about 75% of its weight, whilst two steel pads welded to the forepeak 
    deck at the aft part of the visor bottom took a further ca. 20% and the remaining 
    5% were absorbed by the rubber packings. The visor was kept down by its weight 
    and the 3 (or 5) locking devices which pulled the visor tight against the 
    rubber packings on forepeak deck and both front bulkheads. Thereby any possible 
    play was eliminated and the visor's inside was kept watertight. Forces acting 
    in the forward/aft direction on the visor were transferred by the hinges, 
    the locking devices and the front bulkheads into the structure of the vessel. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In open position 
    the visor was secured by 2 parking devices consisting of 2 hydraulically operated 
    bolts with mating lugs at the aft end of both visor arms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For further details 
    of the visor, its maintenance, operation, opening and closing, etc. reference 
    is made to the relevant parts of the von Tell Manual attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.69.htm" target="_blank">

  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most 
    important was the Atlantic lock or bottom lock. The arrangement is shown in 
    the sketch below. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%201/pg117.jpg" width="426" height="234"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This locking device 
    consisted of a locking bolt (1), movable horizontally in a transverse direction, 
    guided in a bolt housing (2). In extended position the tip of the bolt engaged 
    a support bushing (3). The bolt housing was fixed to the forepeak deck by 
    means of two steel lugs (4) and the bushing was installed in a third similar 
    lug (5), to which a support bracket (6) was fitted. A mating lug (7), attached 
    to the visor itself, was located between the bolt housing and the support 
    bushing when the visor was in the closed position and the extended bolt then 
    engaged the hole in the mating lug.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bolt was moved 
    in the bolt housing between the retracted position and the extended position 
    by means of an hydraulic actuator (8), operated from the control panel located 
    behind the bow and the ramp on the car deck. A spring-loaded mechanical plunger 
    (9), perpendicular to the bolt, engaged grooves in the bolt in the open and 
    closed position, thereby securing the bolt mechanically in its extreme positions, 
    regardless of hydraulic pressure. The bolt was also locked hydraulically at 
    any time because the hydraulic fluid was trapped in the system, regardless 
    of whether the hydraulic system was under pressure or not. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The mating lug at 
    the aft end of the bottom of the visor consisted of a single steel lug, welded 
    to a transverse beam of the visor bottom structure and supported by a bracket. 
    The lug had a hole for the locking bolt with an original diameter of 85 millimetres 
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.70.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.70</a> 
    - drawing of Atlantic lock).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the bolt was 
    moving from open to closed position or the other way round, a vertical plate 
    (10), fitted to the bolt initially, contacted 2 mechanical limit switches 
    fitted to the sensor plate (11), which activated the indicator lights on the 
    control panel on the car deck to show "red" when the bolt was open and "green" 
    when the bolt was in closed position. In case the bolt would be in an intermittent 
    position there would be no indicator light shining.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The control panel 
    was located at the forepart of the car deck at port side (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.71.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.6.2.71</a> - Photo of ESTONIA with the open visor and control 
    panel and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.72.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.72</a> - Car deck with closed bow ramp). Details of the control panel 
    can be taken from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.72.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.4.81.</a> The above description as well as the relevant drawing show the 
    condition at the time the vessel was delivered to AB Sally in June 1980.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The Hydraulic 
    Side Locks</b> were installed at about 1/3 of the height of the visor and 
    consisted of two lugs, mounted to the aft bulkheads of the visor and extending, 
    when the visor was closed, into two openings in the front bulkheads of the 
    hull, inside the rubber packings, whereafter hydraulically operated bolts 
    engaged the holes of the visor lugs. The hydraulic bolt installations were 
    similar to that of the Atlantic lock, i.e. a bolt moving in a bolt housing 
    and, when extended, engaging a support bushing. The visor lug inserted between 
    the bolt housing and the support bushing. The bolt was moved by a hydraulic 
    actuator. The position of the bolt, fully retracted and fully extended, was 
    sensed by magnetic type limit switches activating indicator lights.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Additional hydraulic 
    cylinders - so-called ice-cylinders - were installed at each side to push 
    in a forward direction on the visor lugs when the visor was to open. This 
    installation was intended to assist in breaking the visor open in case it 
    had become frozen fast in closed position. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two vertical stiffeners 
    were installed on the front side of the plating separated by a distance slightly 
    larger than the thickness of the lug itself, to comply with the remark on 
    drawing 49111-330 made by the plan approver of B.V., i.e.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Local reinforcements 
      of the ship's structure in way of locking devices to surveyor's satisfaction.«</i> 
      (see Subchapter 2.4.3. above). </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Directly below these 
    hydraulic side locks, at each side a further set of locking devices, the "manual 
    side locks", were installed consisting of a strong bolt with nut at vessel's 
    side and a strong hook at each side of the visor's aft bulkheads, which also 
    extended through a similar narrow opening into the ship's side. The arrangements 
    of hydraulic and manual side locks can be seen from a respective photo attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.74.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.74. 
    </a>The photo shows the hydraulic lock closed, whilst the manual lock is not 
    engaged. In order to demonstrate the dimensions a photo of the mock-up of 
    the manual side lock is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.75.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After closing of 
    the hydraulic side locks from the control panel on the A-deck the operator 
    or somebody else had to walk into the port side house, up the stairs to B-deck, 
    forward beside the chain locker, then climb through an opening in the deck 
    down into the void space on A-deck from where both the hydraulic and manual 
    side locks were accessible and the bolt of the manual lock could easily be 
    moved between the hooks of the visor. The same procedure had to be repeated 
    at starboard side. The distance to be covered from the control panel to close 
    both port and starboard manual side locks is only about 38 m. The way to walk 
    can be seen from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.76.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.76</a> (2 pages).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The manual side 
    locks are called "reserve" locking devices in the von Tell manual (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.31.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.31</a>), but B.V. calls them in their letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 
    »2 manually operated fasteners for heavy weather« (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.37</a>). - See also Subchapter 2.4.2 / 2.4.3.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The Visor Hinges</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hinges, around 
    which the visor was opening and closing, consisted of a steel/bronze bushing 
    system fitted through holes in the side plates of the visor arms and two steel 
    lugs with a housing in between welded at both ends of the visor arms to the 
    forecastle deck plating. A stainless steel bolt was leading through each of 
    the assemblies at port and starboard side. Securing plates bolted to the outer 
    respectively inner sides of all four steel bushings prevented moving out of 
    the bolt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bearings were 
    lubricated through drillings in the bolt and grease nipples at its ends. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the hinge arrangement 
    was von Tell design and the bushings, and subsequently the bolts, were installed 
    under the strict supervision of the von Tell representative Günther Todsen. 
    His statement - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a> - shall be quoted in connection with the hinge installation as 
    follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Installation 
      of the Hinges </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The bore holes 
      for the bushings were carried out in the shipbuilding hall by means of the 
      a boring machine. I had personally checked and touched the bore holes before 
      the bushings were installed and do confirm that the holes in the visor arms 
      were by no means burnt out. Anyway, I never would have accepted such bungled 
      work as can be on the photos showing the remains of the visor hinge plates 
      of the ESTONIA. In such case that the Yard would not have accepted my objections, 
      I would have the left the vessel and informed my principals.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
      happened for example on a vessel at Dunkirk. I was instructed to carry out 
      repairs to some hatch covers. When the crew refused to supply me with the 
      spare parts necessary to perform a proper repair (although these spare parts 
      were on board) and a proper repair, based on my professional experience, 
      would not have been possible otherwise, I refused to carry on working and 
      returned to Kiel. <br>
      The steel bushings were welded into the visor arms under my supervision 
      and subsequently milled to such an extent that the bronze bushings did fit. 
      These bore holes were performed very exactly to assure that the port and 
      starboard sides were in exact alignment in order to avoid excessive loads 
      on the hinges during opening and closing of the visor. Thereafter the shafts 
      were inserted, whereby also the distance rings were put in place (2 mm thick). 
      I do remember this work in particular, because it was difficult, time consuming, 
      and required a lot of care. The shafts were made of NIROSTA (stainless) 
      steel and had grease grooves with grease nipples. By means of these grease 
      nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once a week.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Todsen as well as 
    the Meyer Werft managers and employees have time and again confirmed that 
    the bore holes in the visor arms for the steel bushings had been drilled and 
    not burned and, as a matter of fact, the port outer part of the visor hinge 
    plate still shows circumferential drilling marks. The sketch below shows the 
    hinge arrangements in detail. </font></p>

    of the ramp 8 sloping flaps were fitted, which automatically extended when 
    the ramp was opening. Each sloping flap worked independently of the others 
    in order to compensate for heeling of the ship as long as the list did not 
    exceed 2°. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ramp was approximately 
    1.5 m longer than there was deck height available, thus was extending the 
    forecastle deck in closed position by that distance. This extension was enclosed 
    by the 'ramp house'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ramp was connected 
    to the vessel's A-deck by means of 4 hinges of which the 2 outer ones were 
    provided with spherical bearings and the 2 inner ones with bronze bushings. 
    The bolts were of stainless steel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ramp was closed 
    by the 2 hydraulic cylinders until the opening was only about 45 mm and the 
    dead centre had been exceeded, thereafter 1 hook at each side of the vessel 
    moved forward, engaged mating lugs at the upper end of the ramp and the ramp 
    was hydraulically pulled tight against the rubber packings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Then 4 conically 
    shaped securing bolts moved from vessel's side into mating pockets at the 
    ramp side, one after the other with audible noises. Once the bolts were fully 
    extended contact was made with magnetic limit switches, switched in series 
    which activated the green indicator light at the car deck control panel. This 
    means that the green light was only activated if all 4 bolts had contacted 
    the respective sensors. The 2 hooks and 4 locking bolts of the bow ramp were 
    activated by means of one lever only and the system functioned in such a way 
    that at first the hooks moved out and pulled the ramp tight against the rubber 
    packings and thereafter the side bolts, one after the other, were activated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The movements of 
    the locking hooks of the bow ramp (ramp hooks) are shown on a drawing attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.3.77.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.3.77</a>. 
    It reveals that the ramp has to be closed by the actuators until there is 
    an opening at the top of no more than 45 mm whereafter the locking hooks engage 
    the mating lugs of the ramp. The particular contour of the hooks was chosen 
    to ensure that when a force was applied a bending moment in the hooks became 
    imposed which pressed the hooks against the pins of the mating lugs, i.e. 
    the hooks could never spring off the pins. Only by plastic deformation after 
    respective load exposure could this locking mechanism fail. Calculations of 
    the hook by means of a FEM-model with contact elements between hook and pin 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.3.78.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.3.78</a> 
    (2) - revealed that plastic deformation commenced at a load of ca. 27 ts. 
    and a so-called "plastic hinge" was built up. In summary it might be concluded 
    that the failure-load of one ramp hook was in the range of ca. 30 ts., whilst 
    the breakloads of the ramp pockets for the securing bolts have been calculated 
    with ca. 15 ts. each. Consequently the total load required to break open the 
    intact and properly secured bow ramp would be in the range of 30 ts. x 2 = 
    60 ts. plus 15 ts. x 4 = 60 ts., thus in total = <b>about 120 ts</b>. The 
    weight of the empty visor is 55 ts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Around the ramp 
    opening rubber packings housed in flat bars welded to the bulkheads were arranged 
    which should have kept the closed ramp watertight (weathertight). </font></p>

    were hydraulically pulled tight against the rubber packings. Then 3 steel 
    cams, extending the bulkheads to both sides of the ramps, moved - hydraulically

  Actuating, monitoring and control systems for the visor,<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Hydraulic System 
    and Hydraulic Cylinders (Actuators) The hydraulic system of VIKING SALLY, 
    serving the car deck installations including visor and ramps, consisted of 
    3 pump stations, 2 big ones and 1 small one. The working pressure for the 
    big ones was about 250 bar and for the small one about 150 bar. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>1</b> big pump 
      station was placed in the stern part of the car deck on the starboard side 
      and served the port side stern ramp, the port side drive-on ramps, the port 
      side hanging decks. <br>
      <b>1</b> big pump station in the fore part of the car deck on the port side 
      served the bow visor, the bow ramp, the starboard stern ramp, the drive-on 
      ramps on starboard, and the starboard hanging decks. <br>
      <b>1</b> small pump station placed in the centre casing on B-deck level 
      served 2 pilot doors, 4 passenger doors, and 2 passenger bridges.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The big pump 
    stations</b> consisted of 1 oil tank each containing 900 litres and 3 pumps. 
    When the system was in normal operation 2 pumps were running and the 3rd one 
    was serving as a reserve unit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The small pump 
    station</b> consisted of 2 pumps and 1 oil tank containing 150 litres. When 
    the system was in normal operation 1 pump was working and the other served 
    as a reserve unit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic system 
    was connected in parallel and the pumps were pressure compensated axial piston 
    pumps which delivered only the required quantity of oil. This quantity, required 
    by each user, was adjusted by throttle valves. The max. working pressure of 
    the pump station was regulated by a safety valve adjusted at newbuilding. 
    It came only into effect if the pressure would exceed the max. working pressure 
    to which the valve was adjusted and should never be changed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon failure of 
    one of the big pump stations the other one could be connected by switching 
    off the two shut-off valves of the failing pump station and by opening the 
    two valves located in the aft pump station, whereafter the "cross-over" between 
    the two hydraulic systems was established. The operating time was slightly 
    longer if the pump station aft was used to serve the forward system, i.e. 
    the bow visor, the bow ramp and drive-on ramps on starboard side. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 
    the hydraulic system of the actuators of the visor, bow and stern ramps do 
    have some relevance for the casualty scenario, its functioning shall be explained 
    in detail, whereby the figures refer to the sketch below:</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing 
      slide valves were moved (19) from right to left, oil would flow from the 
      pressure pipes (P) to the piston undersides, the piston rods moved upwards 
      and the visor opened. The oil at the piston rod sides flowed undisturbed 
      through valves 39 into the return pipes (T).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing 
      slide valves were moved from left to right the oil flow reached in throttled 
      condition (39) the upper cylinder chambers (piston rod side). The pressure 
      in the upper cylinder chambers pushed the pistons downwards. Also the weight 
      of the visor acted on the pistons. At the underside of the pistons overpressure 
      developed as the stop valves (46) closed, the non-return valve (38) prevented 
      oil flow in this direction and the pressure limitation valves (15) were 
      not yet open. Only if excessive pressure had built up at the lower sides 
      of the pistons would the pressure limitation valves (15) open and the visor 
      move downwards.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - There were two 
      reasons for the installation of such valves (15). On the one hand such valves 
      prevented the rapid falling down of the visor in case of pipe and/or hose 
      failures, on the other hand the visor was unable to close by its own weight 
      only. Consequently it was possible to keep the visor in a partly open respectively 
      closed position. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the case of 
      the bow and the stern ramps, which were connected to identical hydraulic 
      systems, it was the other way round because the weight of the ramps acted 
      in the opening direction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In case the 
      visor and bow as well as the stern ramps should be closed or kept closed 
      by hydraulic pressure, the piston rod sides had to be pressurized and the 
      actuators would retract respectively remain retracted. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
      following diagram shows part of the von Tell drawing 49111-387 with the 
      visor actuator - arrow 1 - and the bow ramp actuator - arrow 2 - with the 
      respective hydraulic systems, as explained on the previous pages, fitted 
      to the cylinders.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As these installations 
    were located in the void spaces above and below B-deck as it is visible from 
    the drawing on the next page, they were accessible for the crew. This means 
    that it has been possible to manipulate the valves at the visor and bow ramp 
    actuators from inside the side-houses without having to touch the control 
    panel on the car deck. By means of the above explained "cross-over" effected 
    at the aft hydraulic station - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.31.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.31</a> - it has also been possible to put pressure on the cylinders 
    of visor and bow ramp by means of the aft hydraulic station. In summary it 
    can thus be concluded that it was possible to put pressure on the actuators 
    of visor and bow ramp, i.e. to keep them closed by hydraulic pressure, without 
    having to use the control panel on the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can further be 
    concluded that it was possible to keep visor, bow and stern ramps in a semi-open/-closed 
    condition which, however, required the running of at least one hydraulic pump 
    under continuous load changes (on/off). The visor actuators were connected 
    to the vessel's B-deck by 2 lugs for each cylinder (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.4.79.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.4.79</a> - photo showing B-deck).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Below this deck there 
    were respective stiffeners and brackets fitted, which transferred the forces 
    into the vessel's structure. To lift the visor 118 ts. were required at each 
    cylinder. The maximum lifting power of 1 cylinder at a design pressure of 
    250 bar was 153 ts. The test pressure of the cylinders was 350 bar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the chief engineer Lars Karlsson the hydraulic pumps were changed in 1985/86 
    to more powerful ones which could produce a maxi-mum operating pressure of 
    400 bar. Reportedly the other components of the system remained unchanged. 
    - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.5.60.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.4.5.60</a>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On the route 
    from Turku to Stockholm ice is usually met more frequently and longer compared 
    to the route Tallinn-Stockholm, because the ice inside the archipelago grows 
    faster and disappears later. If, however, the Gulf of Finland respectively 
    the Baltic is covered by ice the route Tallinn-Stockholm is much more difficult 
    and problematic in comparison to proceeding through ice in the archipelago, 
    because the ice at sea is much heavier and thicker. The ice moves with wind 
    and/or current, ice channels open and close quickly, wind and current press 
    the ice floes together and on top of each other, thereby creating ice barriers 
    of several meters thickness.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The maximum speed 
    when proceeding at sea through ice should not exceed 7-8 knots, whereby the 
    ice pressure on the visor should always be the decisive factor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The risk of sustaining 
    severe damage to the bow area and to the under-water hull, however, is most 
    imminent if the Gulf of Finland and/or the Baltic Sea are jointly partly covered 
    by ice and the bridge is manned by inexperienced navigators. The vessel then 
    quickly picks up speed in free water and subsequently crashes with high speed 
    into ice fields, thereby colliding with thick and solid ice floes. </font></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>His function 
    as boatswain in connection with operating the visor/bow ramp was to stand 
    at the control panel. </i></font></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He explained 
    the different handles and also the indicator lights. - He remembered clearly 
    the 2 hooks and 4 bolts of the bow ramp as well as</font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the hydraulic 
    side locks, the Atlantic lock, and also explained that they had never engaged 
    the manual side locks.</font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At some time 
    probably in 1982 it was realised that the visor was no more closing properly 
    because it was in a misaligned condition athwartships. He thinks that the 
    starboard corner was standing a bit up. It was for this reason that the Atlantic 
    lock bolt could no more move through the visor lug. The matter was discussed 
    with the engine crew and it was considered what could be done. </font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Engine repairman 
    Koivisto considered himself to be the visor expert and offered to rectify 
    the Atlantic lock to the effect that the bolt would fit again. Luttunen remembers 
    that Koivisto was even called back from vacation to do the modification.</font></i> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>In the presence 
    of Luttunen and motorman Göran Lindström Koivisto cut off the upper part of 
    the lugs of the Atlantic lock and took off the bushings. Thereafter he welded 
    extended parts on the lug remains and the holes in the lugs now looked like 
    an ellipse, the bushings did not fit any more and were left out as still the 
    bolt would not go smoothly through the visor lug, which was extending apparently 
    too much aft or too much forward. In any event Koivisto cut something off 
    the inside of the visor lug, whereby Luttunen is of the opinion that it was 
    from the forward part.<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After 
    the repairs were completed they realised at once that it was impossible and 
    decided to contact the inspector ashore. The poor modification was inspected 
    and about one week later Swedish speaking people came from the company von 
    Tell AB, cut off completely all 3 lugs of the Atlantic lock and welded new 
    ones to the A-deck with bushings inserted.<br>
    He believes also that it was then realised that there was something wrong 
    with the hydraulic, which was adjusted. The visor lug remained - as far as 
    he remembers - unchanged, i.e. should still be the original.<br>
    When the repairs were completed the von Tell people expressly prohibited Koivisto 
    or anybody else on board to ever manipulate the Atlantic lock again.</font></i></li>

    for repair of ice damage and for modification of the stern area of the hull 
    by incorporation of the "duck tail" extension. Two drydockings were made in 
    Stockholm, one in 1985 for repair of a leaking propeller shaft seal and one

    Shipyard outside Turku for some months until the beginning of 1991 when she 
    was put in service on the Vaasa trade. The interior was upgraded and the sound-proofing 
    in the cabin area was improved by building in ca. 85 tons of steel during 
    this time. Thereafter an inclining experiment was performed by Veli-Matti

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As long as the vessel 
    remained under Finnish flag and thus under the responsibility and supervision 
    of the F.B.N. periodical inspections were apparently carried out every 3 months

    file together with inspection certificate and inspection report issued by 
    F.B.N. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.88.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 3.4.88</a>

    They were not informed by the owners when she was sold. According to the F.B.N. 
    there was no exchange of information/documentation with B.V. before, during 
    or after take-over by the Estonians, because they became aware of the flag 
    and name change only when WASA KING was deleted from the Finnish Register 
    (information H. Valkonen). </font></p>

    to the boatswain Juhani Luttunen already in 1982 it was noted that the visor 
    was slightly misaligned, i.e. the starboard side stood up by about 1 cm. This 
    resulted in a misalignment of the Atlantic lock arrangement and hence the 
    bolt did not fit anymore. To rectify this, motorman Koivisto changed the position 
    of the lugs on the forepeak deck and also modified the visor lug, but in such 
    a miserable manner that the lugs on the forepeak deck had to be completely 
    renewed. This was done by von Tell AB, Gothenburg. For details see Subchapter

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- After a strong 
    ice-winter, probably in 1985/86, at sea water was noted in the visor up to 
    the outside water level. As it turned out that this condition did not improve 
    notably after renewal of the rubber packings and that the water caused a short-circuit 
    in the mechanical sensors of the Atlantic lock, which also affected other 
    installations on the car deck, the mechanical sensors were replaced by watertight 
    magnetic limit switches.<br>
    Lars Karlsson - chief engineer of the vessel for 12 years - stated in respect 
    of <b>rubber packings</b> and the exchange of the <b>mechanical sensors</b> 
    to <b>magnetic limit switches</b> the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The rubber 
      packings of the visor were changed once a year. The packings were mainly 
      damaged on A-deck and ca. 1 m upwards the front bulkheads because the final 
      movement before closure is backwards - not downwards - which destroys the 
      packings due to the rubbing effect. Therefore we did put grease (same as 
      used for the hinges) on the packings and it became better.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 
      some time, probably after the strong ice winter 1986/87, we increasingly 
      had problems with electrical failures, short circuits, etc. with the sensors 
      for the indicator lights of the Atlantic lock. So I checked with other vessels, 
      e.g. VIKING SONG and VIKING SAGA and also the market, and finally bought 
      rather expensive magnetic limit switches, which were installed by electrician 
      Sjögren and we never had problems again. I have been many times with B.V. 
      surveyor Lars-Olof Ålander inside the closed visor when water or light test 
      was made during Load Line survey. I believe that at the same time also the 
      indicator lights were checked.« </font></i></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    information obtained from Håkan Karlsson/Charles Richardson the rubber packings 
    in way of visor and bow ramp were last renewed by the crew during the lay-up 
    time end of 1990/beginning 1991 before SILJA STAR was renamed WASA KING and 
    nothing was done thereafter until the sale in mid January 1993. Consequently 
    at the time of the take-over the same rubber packings, respectively their 
    remains, were in place which had been renewed at the end of 1990. Therefore 
    the last Finnish crew, when preparing the next yard time scheduled for January 
    1993, had asked for renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of the visor 
    and 10 m in way of the bow ramp.</font></p>

      is easy to increase the pressure by just turning a wheel at the hydraulic 
      pump (axial piston pump - make: Vickers). There was a lock nut to regulate 
      the pressure.<br>
      In case of difficulties to open the visor, e.g. due to it being frozen, 
      it is the easiest thing to increase the hydraulic pressure.»</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower parts 
    of the visor were subject to considerable wear, i.e. from the outside due 
    to ice contact and from the inside due to the continuous change between seawater/air 
    as well as additionally to the "sloshing effect" caused by the water moving 
    forward/aft and side to side, comparable to a partly filled tank. The outside 
    was coated with ice-resistant paint (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.89</a>) which could be renewed only during the annual overhaul at the 
    yard. Therefore the ice damaged parts of the coating were painted over with 
    normal blue paint at the end of the ice season. As the lower part of the visor 
    was difficult to access the electrical blocking between visor and bow ramp 
    was manipulated by the electrician in such a way that the visor could be lowered 
    whilst the bow ramp was open. Thus the bottom and lower part of visor were 
    accessible for maintenance work. According to Håkan Karlsson during the time 
    as VIKING SALLY little or no maintenance work was carried out on the visor 
    inside. Lars Karlsson:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Although it 
      should be impossible due to the electrical system the visor can be closed 
      if the ramp is open when the valves are operated manually. In case the rails 
      of the ramp should be deformed this is due to the lowered down visor for 
      working purposes.«</i></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»After every 
      stormy cruise I inspected all the parts in the bow area. Four times a year 
      I inspected in detail all safety relevant parts. This included visual inspection 
      of the visor hinges, its weldings, etc. and also the inside of the visor 
      including locking devices and its welding seams.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During 
      one such inspection I found cracks in way of the foundations of the hydraulic 
      cylinders for the bow ramp bolts which were of fatigue nature and not due 
      to overload. We welded strengthening plates to the foundations to stop the 
      crack development.<br>
      Probably in 1990 we had to change the spherical bearing of the port lifting 
      cylinder and after that experienced twice that the Nirosta bolt of the port 
      visor hinges broke the outer securing plate screws and moved out by ca. 
      1 cm. This was noted by the deck officer being on forecastle deck for berthing 
      because he found the broken off screws. The bolt was hammered back into 
      position, the screw holes in the steel bushing drilled out and the securing 
      plate refitted. If it would have happened again we would have investigated 
      the cause, however, during my time, it did not occur again.<br>
      We never had greasing problems. Once per month grease was pressed into the

    side and the visor would get out of alignment. These regulating valves were

      by the Wärtsilä yard at Turku when the vessel was in drydock with the visor 
      closed (Enclosure 3.4.104 - photo showing bow area). Owners took the opportunity 
      to have the renewed plating of the 1st strake above the ice-strengthened 
      part increased to 20 mm. Survey reports, repair invoices, and damage photos 
      are available at Alandia Insurance Company, Mariehamn. According to B.V.

      by the Estonian government owned transport company Tallinn Autobussi Kondis 
      and by the Ministry of Transport. In Tallinn there was also a company registered 
      by the name of Estline EESTI which, however, was owned 90% by the above-mentioned 
      Estonian share-holders and only 10% by N&T.</font></p>

      Russian Regime, but they had an excellent co-operation with Estline and

      the senior staff employed first, i.e. officers, engineers, and catering. 
      The chief officers also came from Silja. They were Karl Karell (stayed with 
      N&T as nautical adviser on ESTONIA and subsequently MARE BALTICUM, now probably 
      superintendent) and Kjell Kereby (now sailing on Norwegian tankers). The 
      2nd officers were Nils Wigström, Karl Rosen, Juri Aavik, Christian Nordström.

      no support from the owning company N&T. </font></div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    decision to buy DANA REGINA was made by N&T already in October 1989, i.e. 
    long time before Per Ringhagen came into the picture.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After 
    the take-over of the DANA REGINA, in March 1990, the vessel was shifted to 
    Cityvarvet, Gothenburg, where she stayed for several weeks.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Substantial 
    changes were effected, among other things, the bridge layout was changed to 
    the effect that the vessel could be operated on the co-pilot system. The bridge 
    had open wings.</font></div>

    N&T Sten-Christer Forsberg was in Gothenburg more or less all the time together

    responsible for the ESTONIA.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
    most important changes were made in respect of fire-fighting and smoke detection 
    (this was only couple of months after the SCANDINAVIAN STAR disaster and the 
    maritime authorities were very sensitive). Both crews were on board at Gothenburg 
    and trained in fire-fighting, escape, etc. The ship had to pass numerous safety 
    inspections by Sjöfartsverket in order to get the new PSSC. At sea between 
    Gothenburg and Stockholm lifeboat and fire-fighting drills and evacuation 
    exercises were carried out.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 
    Stockholm the owners obtained the new PSSC confirming that the vessel complied 
    with SOLAS 1974 without any exemption, although it was known to Sjöfartsverket 
    that she would trade between Stockholm and Tallinn, i.e. more than 20 nm from 
    the nearest land and she did not have the upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead in a position as required by SOLAS.</font></div>

  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>According 
      to Captain Ringhagen this had also been the case with one of his previous 
      employments, the car/passenger ferry SVEA CORONA. This vessel was subsequently 
      transferred to the US west coast and renamed SUNDANCER. After arrival in 
      the first US port the vessel was at once inspected quite carefully by the 
      US Coast Guard in accordance with Port State Control Regulations. It was 
      immediately discovered that the ferry did not have a properly located upper 
      extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck and have a "partial 
      collision door" at the location required by SOLAS 1974, had to be installed 
      before the ferry received permission to commence trading with US passengers.</i></font></div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T 
    went through the rather costly and lengthy procedure of fulfilling all requirements 
    of Sjöfartsverket to obtain the new PSSC and to change to Swedish flag. As 
    stated it was Ulf Hobro, who as responsible Sjöfartsverket inspector, confirmed 
    that the vessel complied with SOLAS 1974, although she did not. DANA REGINA 
    was renamed NORD ESTONIA, commenced trading on 16.06.1990 between Stockholm 
    and Tallinn and stayed in this service until the beginning of February 1993 
    when she was replaced by the ESTONIA. </font></div>

    do the checking of all drawings relating to the design/ construction of safety 
    relevant installations, do the approval and subsequently issue the respective 
    certificates, however not in respect of hull & machinery matters. According 
    to the respective conditions of the Sea Safety Law this obligation of Shipinspec 
    was delegated to a number of approved Classification Societies, among them 
    B.V., on the basis of particular agreements. These societies have at their 
    disposal considerable technical resources and a worldwide net of inspectors 
    which otherwise Shipinspec would have to create as well. Before this background 
    of technical competence and well established control net the national maritime 
    administrations, such as Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N., have since many years 
    ago acknowledged the requirements and performance of these classification 
    societies. In order to remain up-to-date with rule and/or other changes within 
    the societies, the safety chief is for example a member of the supervisory 
    boards of B.V., DnV and ABS. On the basis of respective agreements B.V. carries 
    out on behalf of Sjövfartsverket, MARPOL, SOLAS and the Load Line inspections 
    on board of Swedish vessels which are classed by B.V. In the light of these 
    agreements and understandings both DIANA II and VIKING SALLY were built with 
    B.V. being the Classification Society and as such also responsible for the 
    approval of structural parts on behalf of Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N. This includes 
    the location of "the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck" as well as the locking devices and hinges of visor and bow ramp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(c) Inspection 
    of foreign passenger vessels regularly calling at Swedish ports</b><br>
    Based on the Sea Safety Law it is also required that passenger vessels, i.e. 
    also car/passenger ferries, who are regularly calling at Swedish ports, have 
    to be inspected as if they are Swedish vessels - see also Subchapter 6.4. 
    In other words they have to pass the so-called "1/92 inspection" before taking 
    up service and thereafter the vessel has to undergo continuous inspections 
    in intervals determined by Shipinspec. This was the situation of the ESTONIA 
    from January 1993 to 28 Septem-ber 1994.</font></p>

    by the "Statens Havarie Kommission" (SHK) - the "Government's Casualty Commission". 
    During the investigation carried out by SHK a representative of Shipinspec, 
    generally the head of the Investigation Department, has to be present. Based 
    on the same law SHK has the authority to delegate the investigation of smaller 
    accidents, which have to be carried out under safety aspects only, to Shipinspec

    and analysis of the available material or the material which should be made 
    available and, furthermore, of a follow-up of induced measures.</font></font></p>

      reads as follows: <br>
      <i>»On the 28th September 1994 on voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm the passenger 
      ferry "Estonia" sank southwest of the Finnish island Utö. The vessel sailed 
      under Estonian flag.<br>

      29th September 1994 the Swedish government instructed SHK to participate 
      in the casualty investigation. Thereupon a Joint Accident Investigation 
      Commission was formed from representatives of the Estonian, Finnish and 
      Swedish authorities. The main objective of the commission was to establish 
      the cause of the casualty.<br>
      Survivors of the shipping catastrophe had reported that the visor had been 
      torn open, which could be one cause of the casualty. <br>
      Subsequently obtained information revealed, that already earlier there had 
      been accidents and problems with bow doors of ferries of the same type as 
      the "Estonia". Proper safety at sea requires that conclusions are continuously 
      drawn from casualty and incidents. In addition to the investigation by the 
      Joint Accident Investigation Commission (JAIC) therefore, also the reporting 
      routines and other procedures adopted by Shipinspec should be closely examined.«

    there were B.V. offices in Trelleborg, Malmö and Stockholm whose senior and

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    previous principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, Lars Olof Ålander, 
    N&T had made it a condition for the ESTONIA to remain under classification 
    of B.V. that only one surveyor, namely his junior colleague, Anders Wirstam, 
    should carry out all the required surveys both in respect of class items and 
    the safety items to be inspected on behalf of the E.N.M.B. This was accepted 
    by B.V. and Anders Wirstam from the Stockholm office became the exclusive 
    surveyor for the ESTONIA in all respects. Upon instructions from the head 
    office in Paris he reported directly to the manager of the B.V. head office 
    for Sweden in Gothenburg, Hans Olsson, thereby bypassing the principal surveyor 
    Lars Olof Ålander - see also<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.3.44.2.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As mentioned 
    before, a contract was agreed also between B.V. and E.N.M.B. and signed already 
    on the 18.08.92 (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.2.114.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 6.2.114</a>), which provided that B.V. would act as agent for the 
    Estonian Administration for the purpose of surveying Estonian flag ships with 
    classification certificates issued by B.V. in order to determine the compliance 
    of such vessels with the mandatory requirements of certain International Conventions 
    referred to in Annex 1 - which includes SOLAS 1974. As the contract had already 
    been running since August 1992 it has to be assumed that B.V. had already 
    carried out some inspections of Estonian flag cargo vessels, but was uncertain 
    about the requirements in respect of car/passenger ferries like the ESTONIA. 
    Therefore B.V. sought the assistance of Shipinspec. The approach, however, 
    was not made by B.V. but by S.-C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&T, although 
    both Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam are ex Shipinspec employees and Wirstam 
    had actually been working under the head of the Stockholm office of Shipinspec, 
    Ulf Beijner, who was now contacted by Forsberg/Hobro.</font></p>

      - born in 1944 - studied marine engineering at Chalmers University, Gothenburg 
      from 1973-1977. Thereafter he joined Sjöfarts-verket and stayed for 13 years 
      until 1990 when he became head of BV-Sweden. Anders Wirstam - born 1942 
      - testified to having had 28 years of experience when being interrogated 
      in November 1994 and has been with Shipinspec Stockholm from 1966-1969 under 
      Ulf Beijner. </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Forsberg and Hobro 
    contacted Ulf Beijner, then still the head of Shipinspec's inspection office 
    Stockholm, on 24.11.92. According to a memo made by Ulf Beijner after the 
    meeting they outlined their plans to replace the NORD ESTONIA by the ESTONIA, 
    including the new companies structures, flag of vessel, Estonian crew and 
    time schedule. They also asked whether Shipinspec could assist B.V. in the 
    take-over procedure which was promised. The respective memo by Ulf Beijner 
    is attached - together with an office translation - as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.117.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.4.117. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly 
    N&T did not just request assistance for B.V. in general, but also requested 
    that Shipinspec should carry out the so-called "2/90 inspection" after the 
    take-over in Tallinn, which was also accepted. This "2/90 inspection" had 
    then already been replaced by official "Regulation 1/92" which came into force 
    on 15 April 1992 by order of the then head of Shipinspec, Safety Chief, Bengt-Erik 
    Stenmark. Regulation 1/92 together with an office translation is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.118.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.4.118</a>. 
    It reveals that the main issue of this regulation is fire-fighting and lifeboat 
    drills respectively the training of crews and passengers in respect of the 
    above and it is quite obvious that this regulation had been drafted under 
    the influence of the SCANDINAVIAN STAR catastrophe. It further reveals that 
    the stated controls and exercises had and have to be carried out on all Swedish 
    flag vessels and all other vessels calling at Swedish ports. In addition, 
    it is required that passenger vessels regularly calling at Swedish ports have 
    to undergo a "1/92 inspection" with acceptable results before the vessel takes 
    up service. Whilst in service the vessel has to undergo continued inspections 
    in intervals determined by Shipinspec, however, at least once a year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Part of the Regulation 
    1/92 are the attachments 1 and 2, i.e. the "Report", and the "Guidance to 
    Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships". Both are attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.119.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 6.4.119</a>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular 
    the "Guidance to Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships", 
    which draws attention to the negative role the human element has played in 
    shipping disasters in the past, had been developed to avoid what did take 
    place only 20 months later on board of MV ESTONIA, a vessel which had been 
    "carefully" checked by inspectors of Shipinspec before taking up her trade 
    and which thereafter had called at Stockholm every second day. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    in addition to those "inspections" the vessel had to be visited frequently 
    by the Classification surveyor Anders Wirstam since ESTONIA participated in 
    the "Continuous Survey System" of B.V., i.e. 1500 items had to be checked 
    during 5 years, viz. 300 per year. For details see Subchapter 9.1.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Further on behalf 
    of E.N.M.B. the same B.V. surveyor had to</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - carry out the

      SOLAS requirements.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously quite 
    a substantial job for one man on a vessel like the ESTONIA. Further details 
    can be found in Subchapter 9.2. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the companies' 
    structure had been established and the basic agreements were made quite some 
    activities developed between N&T and B.V. in connection with ESTONIA's documentation/certification, 
    and it became very obvious that N&T behaved and was treated as if they were 
    the owners. Nowhere in the relevant correspondence do E-Line, Estline or ESCO 
    appear.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the change 
    of flag and also because Estonia is signatory to the SOLAS Convention the 
    vessel had to comply with a number of amendments to SOLAS 1974, which she 
    apparently did not or, at least, B.V. and N&T were uncertain whether she did.

    in way of the accommodation and that subsequently an inclining experiment

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the results 
    of the inclining experiment carried out in January 1991 Ship Consulting Oy 
    drew up a revised "Trim and Stability Booklet" dated 20.01.91, which was stamped 
    "Approved" by the F.B.N. on 23.01.91 and which is attached as Enclosure 3.4.86. 
    It is based on the initial one provided by Meyer Werft for the newbuilding 
    VIKING SALLY. Ship Consulting Oy, however, found that the centre of gravity 
    (CG) - in their opinion - was too far astern which had the following consequences:</font></p>

      (b) the A/Amax value was more than 95% if calculated on a stern trim of 
      0.40 m; if the calculation was made on even keel the Amax value was below

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The "side casings" 
    on A-deck = car deck are the "side houses" which were not weathertight because 
    of the openings in both front bulkheads for the lugs and hooks of the hydraulic 
    and manual side locks of the visor. This was acceptable from the point of 
    view of the Load Line Convention because the "side casings" were considered 
    to be closed structures above the bulkhead deck. Also SOLAS 1974 - II-1, Rule 
    71 (margin line condition) excluded the theoretical flooding of the deck and 
    therefore such openings remained without closures in those years. Moreover, 
    as long as the visor remained weathertight no water could penetrate these 
    openings anyway, because they were located inside the rubber packings of the 
    visor at both front bulkheads. As soon as the visor started to "leak" and 
    became filled with water, these openings became a problem because they extended 
    from about 300 mm above the 3rd stringer level to the 2nd stringer level which 
    is within the area of watermarks visible inside the visor. Behind the openings 
    there was a void space located between A-deck and B-deck, which was accessible 
    only through an opening in B-deck with a sill of 200 mm height, but without 
    cover. It is unknown to this 'Group of Experts' whether the handwritten remark 
    "to be dealt with" on the fax dated 28.03.94, i.e. 6 months before the casualty, 
    had been followed up and, if so, to what effect.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The damage stability 
    calculation by Ship Consulting Oy proved that there was some difficulty to 
    pass the criteria. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although these information 
    relating to the time after the take-over are not strictly in line with the 
    structuring of this report they have to be mentioned here already to demonstrate:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a)</b> the deep 
    involvement of the B.V. head office, Paris and<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) </b>the 
    obvious fact that B.V. and N&T had some problems with the fulfilment of SOLAS 
    requirements concerning stability criteria which were not solved at the time 
    when the vessel sank. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary it can 
    be concluded that B.V. and N&T obviously still had serious problems after 
    the vessel had been in her new service for more than 1 year. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a meeting 
    with Capt. Hummel in July 1996 Veli Matti Junnila of Ship Consulting Oy, who 
    had made the calculations for the old Trim & Stability Manual dated 20.01.91 
    and who was working on the new one upon instructions of N&T at the time of 
    casualty, gave the following comments:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When rechecking 
    the intact and damage stability in the light of the new requirements B.V. 
    found out that the Centre of Gravity (CG) was too much astern. For this reason 
    she had always stern trim.<br>
    - To correct this and to reduce the swell in the archipelago, the duck tail 
    was fitted, which indeed allowed a reduced stern trim and increased the GM 
    because the waterline area was increased. Also the damage stability was improved 
    because the duck tail created more buoyancy in damaged condition.<br>
    - The problem, however, was the margin line which is a theoretical line 3 
    inches or 76 mm below bulkhead deck = car deck. This line must not be submerged 
    in the final stage of the flooding of two compartments - a requirement since 
    SOLAS 1965 - a condition which the ferry did fulfil only with stern trim.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As the first 
    <i>Stability Booklet</i> as well as the second one issued 20.01.91, did not 
    indicate the stern trim requirement and further, did not take into account 
    the duck tail, the built-in 85 tons of steel and, finally, also the stabilisers, 
    B.V. demanded a new <i>"Trim and Stability Booklet"</i> and declared the old 
    one "preliminary".<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He was still 
    working on this booklet when the casualty occurred.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The Stability 
    Booklet of 20.01.91 is based on the actual inclining experiment of 11.01.91 
    when the duck tail was fitted and the 85 ts steel were built-in already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> According 
    to the amended SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Regulation 22, since 1991 passenger 
    vessels have to perform inclining experiments at least every 5 years (see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.121.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.4.121</a>).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - That the cross-flooding 
    valve between the heeling tanks 13 and 14 - a 500 mm butterfly valve operated 
    from the bridge - was not large enough to comply with the requirements of

    6.4.122).</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> This 
    valve had previously been connected to the WT-doors, i.e. when the WT-doors 
    were closed this valve opened automatically. Reportedly this connection had 
    been removed whilst the vessel was owned by Silja, however, there were rumours 
    that the Estonians had re-established the connection. </font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the SOLAS edition 
    in force in January 1993, which included the SOLAS 1974 edition plus subsequent 
    addenda, no Regulation 1 (c) in Chapter II can be found anymore, i.e. the 
    B.V. form is based on an older edition of SOLAS 1974 when Reg. 1 (c) - which 
    is now Regulation 1.4. - contained the following: </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>«Chapter 
    II-1 <br>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>(c) The Administration

      ships or classes of ships belonging to its country which, in the course 
      of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.»</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently it 
    should have been obvious for B.V. that it was not possible to grant any exemption 
    whatsoever as "the vessel proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land 
    in the course of her voyage." As the wording of Regulation 1 (c) is more or 
    less identical to Regulation 1.4. of the 1992 edition of SOLAS 1974 the application 
    of the older form did not make a difference. <br>
    The report continues with <b>item 2 - Survey of Hull and Machinery </b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2.1. Has an 
      inspection of the structure been carried out? Yes, 1-93.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This item is the 
    only one, where the B.V. form does not quote any SOLAS Regulation.</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      the master supplied with the necessary documents concerning stability? Yes.<br>
      (Approved by the Finnish Authorities, pending B.V. approval).« </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Here B.V. correctly 
    did not accept the "Stability Booklet" approved by the F.B.N., because there 
    were indications that it could not comply with all requirements (see Subchapter 
    6.4).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand B.V. accepted the structure of the vessel approved by F.B.N. including 
    the location of the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead, 
    although this was obviously not in accordance with the requirements of SOLAS 
    because the ramp was visibly located too much forward. It did not require 
    a detailed structural examination to find that out but just the knowledge 
    of the structure of the vessel which a Classification Society should have 
    after 12 years of attendance to a vessel built under its supervision! Knowledge 
    of the relevant SOLAS requirements Mr. Olsson and the man from Paris definitely 
    should have had, as the SOLAS rules had then already been part of the B.V. 
    rules for about 10 years. B.V. now argues in defence that the vessel in her 
    previous trade had also proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land - 
    which is true for the leg Vaasa-Sundsvall - and thus they could assume that 
    the structure had been approved by F.B.N. to be in conformity with SOLAS 1974 
    requirements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> SOLAS Regulation 
    12, however, requires:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      Regulation.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">and Chapter II-1,

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»If the ship

      was discussed with Ulf Beijner - the head of the Sjöfartsverket Inspection 
      office Stockholm at that time and in this capacity in charge of the ESTONIA 
      matter - he fully agreed to the developments and sequence-of-events explained 
      on the previous pages, but when it came to the causative connection between 
      the missing "partial collision door" and the catastrophe, he strongly rejected 
      this connection with reference to the explosion hole in the starboard side 
      in way of the 0-deck, which in his opinion was the cause of the sinking.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The findings of 
    the Sjöfartsverket inspectors - as far as available here - can be taken from 
    the handwritten remarks made on pages A - J between 04.01.93 at Turku and 
    21.01.93 in Tallinn and on 21.03.93, when the vessel was again in Turku. These 
    remarks - 9 pages - are attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.126.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.2.126</a> and indicate that at least part of the relevant safety installations 
    had not been in proper condition. It has to be assumed that the deficiencies 
    were rectified prior to Sjöfartsverket approving the vessel, although some 
    of the items either still existed or had reappeared when Åke Sjöblom and his 
    colleague inspected the vessel with their trainees shortly before the last 
    departure. See Chapter 15.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition to a 
    large number of safety checks the Sjöfartsverket inspectors also had an "Operational 
    Control" performed by the new crew of the ESTONIA which consisted of a <b>fire 
    drill</b> and an <b>abandon ship drill</b>. Details can be taken from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.127.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.2.127</a> - Operational Control ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 2 February 1993 
    ESTONIA finally departed from Tallinn with representatives from authorities, 
    B.V. and Sjöfartsverket on board. At sea a function test of ship and crew 
    was successfully carried out and after 2 hours the voyage to Stockholm was 
    resumed. ESTONIA looked perfect as can be seen from the following three photos.

    Estonian captains, Anders Andersson, who had been sacked after repeated clashes

    operation and consequently the radio officer had to keep watch on 500 kHz 
    and 2182 kHz. The watch hours at sea were from 19.00 to 01.00 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the vessel was

    the second officer B was on duty between 20.00 and 01.00 hours assisted by 
    the third officer, and the second officer A was on duty between 01.00 and 
    06.00 hours, assisted by the fourth officer. For the periods between departure 
    and 20.00 and between 06.00 hours and arrival, the bridge watch was taken 
    by the master and the chief officer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the sea voyage, 
    the AB seamen changed watches at 22.00, 02.00 and 06.00 hours. Their duties 
    at sea were to be additional lookouts and to make watch rounds on a defined 
    route throughout the vessel (Supplement). These rounds were made once every 
    hour, starting at 20.30 hours and lasted for about 25 minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Watch rounds were 
    also made by the security guards. They had no other duties than to ascertain 
    the safety and security of the vessel and the passengers, and they patrolled 
    continuously.</font></p>

    of Nordström & Thulin, Ulf Hobro and certain parts of these reports were copied 
    to ESCO. His day-to-day contact within the N&T organisation was Tomas Rasmusson, 
    the assistant to Ulf Hobro. The second engineer was in charge of the separators, 
    the steering gear and all other hydraulic and pneumatic systems, including 
    the systems for manoeuvring and locking the visor, the ramps and the hull 
    doors as well as the stabilisers.</font></p>

    of the department. Regarding personnel, maintenance and other operational 
    matters he reported to ESCO via the master. His economic reporting was to 
    Estline in Stockholm. There was a Swedish or Finnish adviser for the Estonian 
    chief purser, who from the time of the take-over until July 1994 was Marlene 
    Andersson, the wife of the nautical adviser until July 1993, Captain Anders

    of the ESTONIA was taken over by ESCO in 1993, the new safety organisation 
    was based on the safety plan of their previous vessel on the same route, the 
    NORD ESTONIA.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All documents, plans 
    and manuals included in the safety system were in both Estonian and English, 
    and the safety organisation was implemented at all crew levels prior to commencement 
    of traffic. The safety organisation was tested during the operational control 
    in Tallinn before the ferry commenced trading, see Subchapter 6.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The safety organisation 
    and the training and implementation thereof were described in the emergency 
    plan, the safety manual and the training manual.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>Reportedly 
      due to the fact that the NORD ESTONIA had no radio operator and consequently 
      was not included in the safety plan, the radio operator of the ESTONIA - 
      as well as all the Swedish/Finnish advisers - had no functions in the safety 
      list of the ESTONIA.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Various types 
    of alarm were used on board the ESTONIA. The lifeboat alarm and fire alarm 
    were general alarms, addressed to passengers and crew. Besides these there 
    was a coded alarm <i>"Mr. Skylight"</i> addressed only to the crew and intended 
    to alert relevant parts of the safety organisation. The alarms were described 
    in the emergency plan and in the safety manual available at various locations 
    in the crew accommodations such as mess rooms, day rooms and all major workplaces. 
    The different alarms are explained as follows: </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Lifeboat 
    alarm </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lifeboat alarm 
    - seven short sound signals, followed by one long one - was given repetitively 
    with the alarm bells and/or the vessel's horn. When the alarm was given, the 
    command group, the port and starboard boat groups, the engine control group 
    and the eleven evacuation groups were alerted.</font></p>

    alarm</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The fire alarm - 
    continuous repetitive short sound signals - was also given with the alarm 
    bells and/or the vessel's horn. When the alarm was given, the command group, 
    the two fire groups, the engine control group, the control group, the port 
    and starboard boat groups and the first aid groups were activated.</font></p>

    was responsible for stability calculations and was also the deputy fire chief. 
    He commanded the port and starboard lifeboat groups, the first aid group and 
    the helicopter groups. The chief purser was responsible for evacuation, the 
    evacuation group reported to him through forward and aft zone leaders. The

    notes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    emergency plan and the safety manual, the chief officer - not the radio officer 
    - was responsible for external radio traffic. The reason for this is that 
    the safety organisation for the ESTONIA was copied from organisation of the 
    NORD ESTONIA. This ferry had no radio officer.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The various groups

    The drills were led by the group leaders, who also made a report of the content

    the responsible officer in the command group. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fire groups, 
    the engine control group and the boat groups were scheduled for training every 
    two weeks, and the first aid group and the evacuation groups were scheduled

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the ESTONIA 
    commenced her traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm, an operative control 
    was carried out on board by the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, which has been described 
    in Subchapter 6.5.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 2 February 1994 
    the ESTONIA also participated in a major bomb exercise, the RITS &Ouml;vning.

    pool compartments half way between the Estonian and the Swedish coasts, i.e.

    of this exercise was to train the co-operation between the shore-based, helicopter

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The distance from 
    Tallinn to Söderarm is 173 nm, to Sandhamn 177 nm. The distance from Söderarm 
    to Frihamn, however, is 54 nm corresponding to 41/2 hours steaming time (in 
    most parts of the archipelago the speed is restricted to 12 kn), whilst the 
    distance from Sandhamn is only 42 nm corresponding to 3.5 hours steaming time. 
    Therefore the Sandhamn route was preferred. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Assuming that 
    ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on time (which was seldom the case) she was 
    turned on outbound course at the earliest 15 minutes later, whereafter it 
    needed some minutes to reach full speed (which is not taken into account). 
    The ferry consequently had <b>14.75 hours</b> to reach Stockholm.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    Söderarm entrance had to be used she had available for the 173 nm long sea 
    voyage 14.75 hours less 4.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>10.25 hours</b>, 
    i.e. she had to make an average speed of <b>16.87</b> kn to be at the pilot 
    station on time.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    Sandhamn entrance would be used, there was some more time because she had 
    available 14.75 hours less 3.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>11.25 hours</b>, 
    thus had to make an average speed of only <b>15.73 kn </b>to be on time at 
    the pilot station.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An evaluation 
    of the logbooks of the Stockholm pilots for the time between ESTONIA's first 
    call on 03.02.93 and her last call on 26.09.94 revealed the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - During 20 months 
      of service the ferry was only once delayed for 1 hour and that was on 1 
      January 1994 at the Sandhamn pilot station.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At Frihamn 
      Terminal ESTONIA during the same period of time the ferry arrived late only 
      8 times with max. delay of 24 minutes (also on 01.01.94).<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- None of 
      these delays could apparently be attributed to weather influence.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Delays 
      occurred, however, generally upon departure from Stockholm, although only 
      seldom of more than 20 minutes. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In total, 
      the vessel departed from Stockholm 12 times with more than a 30-minute delay. 
      It has to be assumed that it was worse in Tallinn, according to the reports 
      of previous passengers. Pilot or harbour master logbooks from Tallinn, however, 
      are not available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An examination of 
    the logbook entries of the Stockholm Pilots Association for the three days, 
    when according to the SMHI ESTONIA had met wind and sea state conditions comparable 
    to those encountered during the night of the casualty, has revealed the following: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 5 February 1993 
    ESTONIA arrived at 05.59 hours at the Sandhamn Pilot, on 23 January 1994 at 
    05.43 hours at Söderarm Pilot and on 6 March 1994 at 05.25 hours at Sandhamn 
    Pilot. Consequently she was always on time. The respective logbook pages are 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.140.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.3.140</a>, <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.141.htm" target="_blank">12.3.141</a> 
    .<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since no detailed 
    information is available from the Estonian side and previous passengers frequently 
    experienced considerable delays on arrival in Tallinn, the eastbound voyages 
    cannot be evaluated.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    it is a fact that ESTONIA met at least 6 times similar or worse wind and wave 
    conditions compared to those she met on the night of the accident, however, 
    without delayed arrival (on the westbound voyages) and it is unknown whether 
    damage to the visor and its locking devices were sustained. The last time 
    she met similar conditions was only on 19 August 1994, i.e. 5 weeks before 
    the casualty, and at this time all the disastrous deficiencies - as will be 
    explained later on - were already existing. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation 
    of the arrival times at the Stockholm Pilot stations outlined above also reveals 
    that ESTONIA obviously always maintained her schedule, regardless of the prevailing 
    weather and/or ice conditions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation for 
    this adherence to schedule by all means and under all circumstances can probably 
    be found in</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the pride 
      of the newcomer wanting to be at least as good as the competitors Silja 
      and Viking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the pressure 
      of competition from the large and more comfortable Stockholm-Helsinki ferries 
      which - according to Ulf Hobro - was also the reason for the installation 
      of stabilisers at high costs after less than 1 year in service. As a matter 
      of fact Ulf Hobro had asked Turku Repair Yard already in the beginning of 
      April 1993, i.e. after ESTONIA had been in service for just 2 months, but 
      mainly in bad weather, to quote for the installation of stabilisers. The 
      offer was submitted on 5 April 1993 and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.143.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      12.3.143</a>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The pressure on 
    the masters of ESTONIA from the Board members of Estline AB is confirmed by 
    the statement of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    5.3.111</a> - who has stated that during board meetings of Estline AB it had 
    been repeatedly stressed that ESTONIA had to maintain her arrival at Stockholm 
    by all means and that this had been made quite clear to the masters, who sometimes 
    attended the board meetings. This is said to be written in the protocols of 
    these board meetings which must be still available. The apparent fact that 
    the masters of ESTONIA did their utmost to maintain the schedule was obviously 
    not unknown to the crew as it is demonstrated by the questioning of motorman 
    Ziljajev, who testified in this connection as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b><i>Q</i></b><i>: 
    Was it a must or was it a requirement from the management that ESTONIA or 
    any other vessel may not miss her schedule, i.e. be delayed?<br>
    <b>A:</b> With ESTONIA we were always on time. The master had a time schedule 
    received from the owners and we were always on time. The masters always followed 
    the schedule received from the company. According to contract he had to follow 
    this schedule. <br>
    <b>Q:</b> You have now told us about the obligations of the master to follow 
    the schedule. There are rumours that masters who are unable to keep the schedule 
    will be sacked. <br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes, that is principally so. This is the requirement of the company 
    that the master has to maintain the schedule. Some of the passengers have 
    to reach other connections and if they miss them, because the vessel is delayed, 
    the company has to pay compensation. <br>
    <b>Q:</b> Which company has worked out the schedule? <br>
    <b>A:</b> Estline AB. But I don't blame Estline for anything. Each company 
    has its own schedule, where it is described up to the minute. If a company 
    buys a ship, then it is not completely known how the vessel reacts during 
    operation, how much power is needed, among other things, during a storm.</i></font></p>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b> Manfred 
    Salzberg</b> - travelled together with his wife on 01.02.94 to Tallinn on 
    board ESTONIA by car. Upon arrival in Tallinn the crew was unable to open 
    the bow ramp. It took one hour before they were able to open it by means of 
    heavy hammers. (Why didn't they warm it up?) It was frozen fast. He has a 
    number of pictures showing the forepart.</font></font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Henning Frederiksson</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">: 
    Out of 6 trips, the last one on 12/13 June 1994, he and his wife saw 5 incidents 
    when crew members were banging on the locking bolts of the bow ramp with sledge 
    hammers. He recalls the upper starboard and lower port bolt. It took the crew 
    10 minutes and more to open or close one bolt. They always drove on board 
    among the first cars at Stockholm, thus were close to the bow ramp and could 
    observe the activities of the crew rather closely. </font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Åke Eriksson</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    - travelled on the ESTONIA in September 1994: The car deck was wet. Upon departure 
    from Stockholm the crew was unable to close the visor. Quite a number of crew 
    members were jumping around on the forecastle deck. Upon departure from Tallinn, 
    one week later, the departure was delayed by 2 hours because the visor could 
    not be closed. </font></li>

  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Anton B. Paulomo</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">: 
    In July 1994 two of his friends were travelling by bus from a place in Lithuania 
    together with a couple of others via Tallinn on the ESTONIA to Stockholm for 
    shopping. On the way back they had to wait for 3 hours in Tallinn before the 
    crew was able to open the visor, which was only possible after some burning/cutting 
    had taken place. They left the bus and went up to the 8th deck overlooking 
    the forecastle deck from where they observed what the crew and subsequently 
    also workers from ashore were doing. The statements of Anton Paulomo and his 
    two friends will be available.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Gerhard Stenhammer</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    - a Stockholm pilot and now retired, had observed shortly before the casualty 
    that after departure from Frihamn Terminal the crew tried to close the visor 
    for 15 minutes by opening/closing with loud bangs until it became silent. 
    The master explained that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. 
    The pilot asked the master whether the locking devices would still fit and 
    the answer was 'no problem'. In the opinion of pilot Stenhammer the visor 
    was 'out of geometry'.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Lars Lindström</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    - was on board as a passenger with car the last week in July 1994. Their car 
    was the last one to roll on board in Tallinn, the bow ramp was closed behind 
    them and they were leaving the car when he realised that 2 crew members were 
    trying to lock the starboard lower bolt of the bow ramp, which did not work. 
    A third one came with an iron bar in his hand, was hammering a couple of times 
    on the pocket, without the bolt moving at all, whereafter they turned round 
    and walked away by saying: <i>"It can remain as it is"</i>, although the bolt 
    was not locked. (He speaks and understands Estonian.) He has subsequently 
    written a letter to Estline AB and complained about the above, whereafter 
    he received a letter stating that the securing bolts and locking devices were 
    the responsibility of a Finnish engineer company, the name of whom he also 
    received. He wrote to them as well as to Det norske Veritas, but never received 
    a reply. (The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.154.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    (trained as a shipyard welder) made more than 50 trips on the ESTONIA, lost 
    his wife and children during the casualty.<br>
    It was on 3 March 1994 when they arrived in Tallinn and when for the first 
    time he noted that something was wrong with the ferry. His car was the second 
    one from forward and he watched how the crew tried in vain to open the visor, 
    he was nervous because he had to reach the Belorussian Embassy before they 
    closed to obtain a visa. He speaks and understands the Estonian language, 
    thus picked up from crew members talk that they were unable to unlock the 
    side locks of the visor, he left his car and told the crew members to lift 
    / lower / lift / lower, etc. the visor in short intervals and, when lowering, 
    try to open the side locks simultaneously, they followed the advice and after 
    about 30 minutes they finally managed to open the visor and subsequently also 
    the bow ramp, which did not create problems. There was no ice in the port 
    of Tallinn at the time, however, he seems to remember that there had been 
    ice at sea.<br>
    Later, probably on 27 March 1994 he was again on his way to Tallinn when the 
    same happened, but this time it took the crew only 15-20 minutes to open the 
    visor.<br>
    He had the definite impression that the visor was totally misaligned and did 
    not fit anymore into the locking devices. The interview is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.155.htm" target="_blank">

        3 times. He made a sympathetic, open and experienced impression on me, 
        however, I don't know anything about his behaviour in unusual situations.<br>
        Concerning the bow ramp I would like to state that in January 1994 in 
        Tallinn I, together with many others, had to wait for ca. 45 minutes because 
        they were unable to unlock the ramp. It could not be opened. My car was 
        the first one to leave the car deck which I had arranged respectively 
        with the chief officer. The car was the first in line at port side, directly 
        next to the hydraulic pump controls which were at port side. <br>
        They had a problem with the system and alleged that the ramp was frozen 
        fast.<br>
        The Estonian crew members tried to open the bow ramp in vain for about 
        20 minutes by operating the hydraulic different ways, then started to 
        hammer against the what he believed were the securing bolts, also in vain, 
        then they asked the Swedish adviser to come down and he believes it was 
        Karl Karell. He stepped out of the car, shook hands with him and said: 
        'Why do the Estonians switch off the hydraulic system at sea?' He shrugged 
        and said something like "one year with Estonians is more than enough", 
        but he did something whereafter it was possible for the crew to open the 
        bow ramp and they left the ferry.«</font></i></p>

        port side remained down. Only after several ups and downs of the ramp 
        and something else he could not identify, the crew managed to close the

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»I have actually 
        seen crew members working at the bow ramp many times by hammering, welding 
        or cutting (burning). I have seen the gas bottles and considered it to 
        be very dangerous. As I am quite familiar with the way the crews from 
        ex Eastern Block countries work, I was, however, not too surprised. It 
        was clearly visible that the bow ramp was severely misaligned respectively 
        bent. In open condition the port side was much lower compared to the starboard 
        side. The bow ramp could not be opened in one go, but had to be raised/lowered 
        several times before it was finally down.<br>
        Before the ramp was lowered down completely to the quay two crew members 
        jumped on the quay and rolled one or two rope coils underneath the starboard 
        side of the ramp, which was still 30-40 cm above the quay when the port 
        side was already resting on it. I remember also to have seen that wooden 
        pallets were placed underneath the starboard side of the bow ramp instead 
        of the rope coils.<br>
        I am also of the opinion that, at least during the last months before 
        the catastrophe, the bow ramp could not be closed completely anymore, 
        because several times I observed from my position at the fore part of 
        the car deck that light was falling on to the car deck as soon as the 
        visor began to open, i.e. before the bow ramp itself was even moved. This, 
        in my opinion, is only possible if the bow ramp was already open to a 
        certain extent when the visor opened. The light came in at the upper port 
        side. The whole ramp was badly misaligned, in particular the port side 
        looked very bad, whilst the starboard side looked quite in order. Once 
        I saw a crew member standing on a wooden pallet which was lifted up by 
        a forklift standing behind the closed bow ramp at port side. The man was 
        lifted up to a position just underneath what I believe was the upper bolt. 
        After some hammering to the area where the bolt was located the man was 
        lowered down to the car deck again. <br>
        I also remember more or less always having seen a large number of wooden 
        pallets on the car deck, which were stowed behind the side houses at both 
        sides. <br>
        On my last trip to Tallinn before the casualty (I missed one sailing) 
        my car was on the hanging deck at starboard side. Thus I could not see 
        what was going on at the ramp and the visor when being opened. I saw, 
        however, crew members working at the bow ramp before it was lowered down. 
        When I drove down the ramp I saw the equipment for either welding or burning 
        (gas bottles) laying at port side near ramp. We had to wait longer than 
        normal, maybe half an hour or more before the bow ramp opened. I remember 
        this clearly, because I had people waiting for me at the quay who had 
        left before I was from board because it took so long. It could be the 
        time <b>when I saw the visor moving up and down several times before the 
        bow ramp opened combined with banging noises and also hammering.</b>«</i></font></p>

        we had first gone to the wrong terminal. As we were late the ship left 
        straight away. After we had settled down in the cabin, I believe on the 
        6th deck, which was overlooking the foreship, I went to the window and 
        looked down onto the foreship while the vessel was proceeding through 
        the archipelago. I immediately had the impression that it was a very old 
        vessel in a bad condition. I saw a couple of empty foundations where the 
        parts belonging on top, e.g. mooring winches and the like, had been taken 
        away. I had a rather negative impression from the beginning, also that 
        apparently a lot of paint layers were used without taking care for what 
        was underneath. I also noted that the mooring ropes were substantially 
        worn and in a bad condition. They looked simply worn and over-stretched.

        a big sledge hammer on the port edge of the visor which was extending 
        the forepeak deck by some 10 cm. The gap was in any event big enough so 
        that I showed it to my wife. We could see the water through the gap. The 
        other man was standing on the forecastle deck opposite to the one with 
        the sledge hammer and I could only see his back side. The visor was obviously 
        not properly closed because its port side was standing upwards above the 
        level of the forecastle deck, worse at the port outer corner on which 
        the crew member was hammering, apparently without success, as far as I 
        remember.<br>
        The window could only be opened by force. I also checked the nearest way 
        to the rescue station. I think we stayed in the cabin for about 1 hour, 
        after some time the hammering stopped but the visor edge was still standing 
        up.«</font></i></p>

        leeway for the pilot boat. I jumped on board from the upper platform of 
        the pilot boat, the port pilot door was open. Under such conditions one 
        has to expect water splashing up from below between ferry and pilot boat.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Since no information 
    about the operating history of the vessel was made available by owners/managers 
    and also the Final Report of the JAIC contains very little in this respect, 
    members of this 'Group of Experts' have spoken to previous passengers, advisers 
    and crew members in order to find out how ESTONIA and her crew did perform 
    during the 20 months in service under Estonian flag. Further information has 
    come from viewers of the Swedish TV program 'EFTERLYS' after the ESTONIA casualty 
    had been presented and viewers were requested to report about their own experiences 
    on board the ESTONIA, which about 40 viewers did. The reports submitted during 
    or immediately after the program - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.145.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.4.145</a> - were analysed and the witnesses assumed to have made 
    relevant observations were contacted by a Swedish speaking expert of this 
    'Group of Experts' either personally or by phone. The results are summarised 
    in two faxes from Oy Mariner's Assistance Ltd. Ab, Helsinki to Marine Claims 
    Partner (Germany) GmbH, Hamburg dated 30.07.97 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.146.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Next a letter shall 
    be quoted which the retired Captain Joel Haukka wrote on 2 February 1996 to 
    his old mate Captain Hans Rosengren, lecturer at the Nautical Academy Kalmar 
    and a member of the Swedish part of the JAIC:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»I have made, 
        at least, 20-25 voyages on the ESTONIA and was, at least, 3 times on the 
        bridge.<br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
        am sending you the Swedish translation of an interview with Andi Meister 
        published in the Estonian newspaper 'Postimees' on 16 January 1996.<br>
        Read the article and draw your own conclusions.<br>
        For me, having read his statement, it is a further confirmation that the 
        guy doesn't know what he is talking about.<br>
        He made it quite clear that the causes of the catastrophe are exclusively 
        technical. <br>
        Why is the excessive speed not taken into account?<br>
        In interviews and statement by the Estonian members of the JAIC it is 
        said that the speed is of no relevance and had no effect on the catastrophe.<br>
        The chairman of the Commission has furthermore given wrong information 
        in the interview when he stated that during the voyage there would be 
        nobody on the car deck.The crew went safety rounds on the car deck. <br>
        At the same time I am asking the question, after having read in the interview 
        about all the deficiencies that had been on the vessel, why were these 
        obvious deficiencies not rectified when the vessel changed flags to Estonia? 
        <br>
        The vessel was for a longer time sailing under Estonian flag and it should 
        very well have been noted that the ramp was at the wrong place. <br>
        Or didn't they have competent masters and superintendents who were able 
        to find that out?<br>
        According to the Estonian newspapers one of the conclusions in the Final 
        Report shall be that the speed had no relevance for the catastrophe, which 
        is totally wrong and not understandable because the vessel was proceeding 
        with full engine power against a full storm. Many people, who do not even 
        have own experience with good seamanship, will laugh about it. Already 
        in the autumn (1995) the public has pointed to the fact that the Estonian 
        Commission is biased. This is true, but the required consequences have 
        not been taken.<br>
        The Commission itself does everything to make the Final Report, which 
        is of substantial international interest, a farce, which is absolutely 
        impossible.<br>
        Forsberg did indeed state in yesterday's 'Svenska Dagbladet' that the 
        survivors had been questioned by the police. I am asking you, Hans: Is 
        it possible for an external, who has never had to do with shipping or 
        with how to handle a vessel, to ask the proper questions to establish 
        a correct picture (scenario) of what had happened?«</font></i></p>

        over the bow visor and were smashing with remarkable force against my 
        cabin window. Each time the vessel was diving into a wave-trough there 
        was banging - metal on metal - and I had the feeling that the visor was 
        loose. It was impossible to sleep, so I got dressed and walked all around

    Damage and Repairs</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Generally the information 
    available from on board is restricted to the observations of passengers as 
    basically reported in Chapter 12.4, because the crew members had been forbidden 
    by their employer ESCO to talk about ESTONIA at all. Only very few have talked, 
    although very carefully, as will be explained on the following pages.</font><br>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has also been very 
    difficult to obtain information from N&T/Hornet AB/ Estline or ESCO. Apart 
    from the discussion with Ulf Hobro during the first meeting with the JAIC 
    in Stockholm in February 1995, there are only some details available from 
    the files of the public prosecutor and from those of the JAIC, which will 
    also be discussed subsequently. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>1. Maintenance</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was drydocked 
    at Turku between<b> 4-8 January 1993</b> and the necessary inspections were 
    carried out. At this time also some maintenance work was performed which had 
    been partly ordered by the old owners, Wasa Line, and partly by the technical 
    managers of the new owners, N&T, as outlined in detail in Subchapter 6.5.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently in 
    January 1993 during the time at the yard:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>a)</b> the locking 
    devices of visor and bow ramp were neither serviced nor strengthened, and 
    <br>
    <b>b)</b> the outer hinges of the bow ramp were not serviced nor were the 
    bushings and bolts renewed, and<br>
    <b>c)</b> 15 m of the rubber packings of the visor and 10 m of the rubber 
    packings of the bow ramp were not renewed. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (a):<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the 
    crew was unable to service and strengthen <b>the locking devices of visor 
    and bow ramp</b>, they were never serviced and strengthened until the casualty. 
    Since the crew was also unable to service the hinges of the bow ramp and to 
    renew the bushings and bolts, in particular the port outer hinge, it is a 
    fact that nothing was done to rectify the poor condition of - at least - the 
    port outer bow ramp hinge. It is, however, known from Börje Stenström, head 
    of the technical group of JAIC, that the crew had put the damaged port outer 
    bow ramp hinge on the repair list a number of times, but that repairs were 
    postponed by the technical managers until the next scheduled yard stay, probably 
    in January 1995. The respective memo is attached as Enclosure 12.5.166. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (b): </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>visor 
    hinges </b>required professional maintenance which the crew was apparently 
    also unable to provide, because according to the testimony of the 2nd engineer 
    Peeter Tüür in June 1996, who is responsible for the technical functioning 
    of visor and bow ramp - the crew had problems to have the hinges properly 
    greased and even had <b>to add oil to the grease to ensure that the grease 
    reached all parts to be lubricated </b>- see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.167.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.167</a>. Needless to say that the effect of grease is destroyed by adding 
    oil. Due to the severely misaligned visor the hinges could no more be properly 
    lubricated. This resulted in excessive wear of the bronze bushings which consequently 
    had to be renewed.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Such renewal 
    is normally effected by drilling out the steel and bronze bushing by means 
    of a particular milling installation in order to avoid damage to the hinge 
    plates, which would be created if the bushings would be burned out. Whereas 
    drilling, including proper welding of new bushings, takes about 2 days in 
    port - whilst the visor is detached from the vessel and the vessel thus has 
    to be taken out of service - burning is much faster, however, is combined 
    with a loss of material of the hinge plates, the creating of deep burning 
    marks, each of which is a crack starter. It is obvious that such damage to 
    the hinge plates reduced their weight carrying capacity and furthermore increased 
    the propagation of fatigue cracks in the hinge plates. For further details 
    see Subchapter 34.3. Although denied by the technical managers and crew, the 
    steel bushings of both visor hinges were evidently burned out and replaced 
    by new steel and bronze bushings which, however, were fitted in a very unprofessional 
    way. This will be further explained in Subchapter 34.3. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (c):</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On one hand 
    the responsible inspector in the organisation of the technical managers, N&T, 
    Ulf Hobro, stated before the JAIC on 17 February 1995:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»... we did 
      not care for the rubber packings, we have never renewed any of them nor 
      was it ever our intention to do so. The visor was full of water at sea and 
      this was known to everybody.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, 
    Lennart Klevberg, in charge of spare parts with N&T, did testify to the criminal 
    police Stockholm, that </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»rubber packings 
      for the visor had been ordered but were not installed because Capt. Andresson 
      and Tomas Rasmusson had decided to wait until MARE BALTICUM would be taken 
      over in order to do the replacement on both ferries simultaneously.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This does not make 
    much sense, however, based on the underwater videos it is indeed a fact that 
    the rubber packings of the visor were missing from forward of the Atlantic 
    lock along the whole port side and about 1 m up the front bulkhead, whilst 
    at the starboard side there were some rubber packings from forward of the 
    Atlantic lock to the "corner of the mouth", which was empty up to ca. 2 m 
    of the front bulkhead. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious 
    that the visor was no more weathertight and thus full of water at sea up to 
    the outboard level as evident from the watermarks inside of the visor.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>2. Damage and 
    Repairs</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The crew also denied 
    ever having carried out repairs to the visor, the bow ramp and/or to their 
    locking devices. This is true as far as the major repairs are concerned which 
    would have been necessary to bring the visor back into proper shape and alignment, 
    but which were never carried out. The crew, however, is wrong as far as numerous 
    smaller repairs and rectifications to the visor, the bow ramp and their locking 
    devices are concerned which were frequently performed to avoid the worst and 
    keep visor and bow ramp best terms possible in workable condition. This had 
    been observed by many passengers as outlined in Chapter 12.4. and was even 
    admitted by crew members, for example by the safety officer Ervin Roden who 
    told Spiegel TV on 02.05.97, among other things:<i> "Something was always 
    being repaired on board. There was always welding work being carried out. 
    I am uncertain whether also to the visor. But everywhere repairs were carried 
    out, also in the area of visor and bow ramp and also by the Finns."</i> The 
    complete interview is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.168.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.168. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apart from 
    the damages existing already when the ferry was taken over from the previous 
    owners and which were not repaired by the new owners/ managers, it is quite 
    obvious that the ferry sustained more damage to the visor and consequently 
    also to its fixing points, the hinges and locking devices, when for example 
    forcing ice at excessive speed as observed by various passengers. The observation 
    repeated below is just one example: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»<b>Observation 
      by Henning Frederiksson on 24.03.94:</b><i> It was stormy weather and "Estonia" 
      was proceeding in open water at full speed with a following sea when she 
      met pack ice, into which she crashed without any speed reduction. "Estonia" 
      came fast into the pack ice with an enormous crash and had to go backwards 
      and try again. There was 16 m/sec. storm, nevertheless, "Estonia" kept her 
      high speed.«</i></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of such 
    reckless navigation are clearly visible on the large photo on the previous 
    page which was taken on the following day, 25 March 1994, in Tallinn by the 
    professional photographer Li Samuelson.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ice damage 
    sustained by the visor during the months of February and March 1994, when 
    the Gulf of Finland and the Northern and Middle Baltic where more or less 
    continuously covered by ice (see Subchapter 12.4.2), were roughly repaired 
    by replacing parts of shell plating and bottom of the visor in Tallinn whilst 
    the vessel remained in service. The renewed parts are still visible on the 
    visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is also confirmed 
    by the observation of the passenger Christer Eriksson, who reported the following: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I travelled 
      to Tallinn on the "Estonia" on 3/4 May 1994 and left the vessel only at 
      about 10.30 hours when all the other passengers had already gone ashore. 
      The gangway was pulled in and I had to go ashore via the car deck and bow 
      ramp. When I came down on the car deck I noticed a curtain of sparks falling 
      down from the open visor on to the bow ramp and I managed to jump through 
      it and saw on the bow ramp a giant red transformer turned 90° towards the 
      ramp which in my opinion was Red Army surplus. Cables were running up to 
      the port side of the forecastle deck/visor, where obviously heavy burning/ 
      cutting work was in progress. When I returned from ashore at about 06.00 
      hours the workers were just collecting their tools, but the huge transformer 
      was still on the bow ramp.« </i></font></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the 
    work explained above doubtlessly falls into the category "maintenance & repair" 
    and also could not be considered very minor, the repairs are not mentioned 
    in the <i>"List of Maintenance and Repair Works on M.V. 'Estonia', </i>April 
    1993 - August 1994" which is Supplement No. 230 to the Report of the JAIC. 
    Since also other visible repairs do not appear on this list, it has to be 
    assumed that the list is incomplete for obvious reasons. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also <b>Lars Gunnar 
    Nyström</b> informed the Swedish Commission that he had made many trips on 
    the ESTONIA. In February and March 1994 he was on board when ESTONIA was forcing 
    ice twice and arrived in Tallinn once with a delay of 1.5 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage 
    sustained by the visor while proceeding at full speed through ice barriers 
    several meters high and using the vessel as an ice breaker is demonstrated 
    by the preceding photo and can also be seen on the video image below made 
    from a film of 30.03.94.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a result of the 
    sustained severe structural damages and in combination with the different 
    lifting speeds of the actuators and severely worn out hinge bushings, the 
    visor became increasingly misaligned and out of geometry. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All of this 
    led to problems - observed and reported by passengers as described in Subchapter 
    12.4 - during the opening and closing which also affected the locking devices 
    and reportedly the problems became worse and took more time to be overcome 
    the nearer the day of ESTONIA's last departure came. This is demonstrated 
    by the following examples:</font></p>

    crew was able to open the visor, which was only possible after some burning/cutting 
    had taken place. They left the bus and went up to the 8th deck overlooking 
    the forecastle deck from where they observed what the crew and subsequently 
    also workers from ashore were doing. The respective letter from Paulomo is

    that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. The pilot asked the 
    master whether the locking devices would still fit and the answer was "no

    Finally crew members brought two gas bottles plus burning gear to the door

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>3. The Bow Ramp</b> 
    was the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck and 
    as such had to be mandatorily weathertight. Therefore the ramp required regular 
    maintenance of the rubber packings, the hinge arrange-ment and the locking 
    devices. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before 
    10 m of the rubber packings should have been renewed already during the yard 
    time in January 1993, however, this was never done up to the casualty. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers 
    to the locking devices of the bow ramp which should have been serviced and 
    strengthened already in January 1993, which was also never done. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst damaged 
    and missing rubber packings cause a bow ramp which is otherwise in proper 
    condition to leak, this becomes much worse if the bow ramp is visibly misaligned 
    and twisted. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This had been 
    the case on ESTONIA for several months before the casualty and the condition 
    deteriorated as time went by. It is a fact that water was penetrating the 
    bow ramp already in 1993 according to the evidence of passengers and pilots. 
    In particular the statement of the Stockholm pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a> - is striking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following drawing 
    clearly demonstrates that already in calm sea the water rose above the 3rd 
    stringer inside the also severely leaking visor due to the height of the bow 
    wave at full speed. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg305.jpg" width="437" height="396"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the lower part 
    of the deck opening with the missing and/or damaged rubber packings (see arrow 
    on drawing) was below the 3rd stringer level of the closed visor, it is obvious 
    that water penetrated the car deck already in calm sea when the vessel was 
    on full speed (height of bow wave ca. 2.5 m). It is also obvious that the 
    water inside the visor rose when the vessel was pitching in head seas. The 
    height of the water inside the visor depended on the height of the outside 
    water level, i.e. when the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle 
    for a certain time the visor would fill up more or less completely with respective 
    water pressure on the leakage of the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since absolutely 
    nothing had been done to improve the condition of the rubber packings and 
    also no maintenance to the bow ramp had taken place since the vessel was put 
    under Estonian flag, also the condition of the ramp hinges, in particular 
    the port outer one, deteriorated continuously. This process was being sped 
    up by the wrong loading of the car deck through the also apparently in this 
    respect rather inexperienced Estonian officers, because the vessel frequently 
    had a list during loading/unloading when the heavy trucks were rolling on/off 
    board via the bow ramp and the effect on the already pre-damaged and weakened 
    hinges of the bow ramp was disastrous. This finally led to the complete destruction 
    of the port outer hinge and the breaking of the inner lug connecting the ramp 
    to the vessel, whilst the outer lug slid off the hinge bolt apparently after 
    the securing plate was broken off. The result is explained by a truck driver 
    who witnessed this incident as follows: </font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I drove on 
      board as one of the last trucks and after leaving my truck I saw that the 
      crew tried to close the bow ramp, which was not possible because only the 
      starboard side came up while the port side remained down. Only after several 
      ups and downs of the ramp and some other things done by the crew did they 
      finally manage to close the ramp. Ever since then the ramp was visibly twisted 
      and when the visor opened and the bow ramp was still "closed", light fell 
      in through the upper left corner.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above is based 
    on a telephone conversation in December 1997. It has not yet been possible 
    to take the statement of the truck driver.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This severe damage 
    to the port outer hinge and to the ramp itself was reported by the crew to 
    the technical managers and also put on the repair list several times according 
    to Börje Stenström (see Enclosure 12.5.166). However, nothing was done to 
    rectify this damage despite the fact that it constituted a severe violation 
    of the SOLAS - and Class - requirements because evidently the open car deck 
    was, via the leaking bow ramp, connected to the visor which at sea was filled 
    with water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As no maintenance 
    took place the crew tried to seal the leaks as best they could by putting 
    mattresses, blankets and rags into the openings between the ramp and car deck/bulkhead 
    at the port lower corner. As a further consequence of the detached port lower 
    side of the bow ramp the port lower securing bolt no longer fitted into the 
    ramp pocket, whilst the upper port bolt fitted only to a limited extent and 
    it is doubtful whether the port ramp hook was able to engage the lug at the 
    ramp side at all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These very severe 
    deficiencies led to continuous problems for the crew when opening and closing 
    the bow ramp and/or the locking devices which had been observed by many passengers, 
    in particular by the truck drivers using the ferry twice a week or more as 
    summarised in Chapter 12.4. These observations prove that the bow ramp as 
    well as its locking devices had been in a very poor state of maintenance and 
    that they no more fulfilled the SOLAS and the Class requirements.</font></p>

      Ulf Hobro was the inspector/ superintendent of the vessel for the whole 
      time and spent a large part of his working time on MV "Estonia". Hobro checked 
      the condition of the vessel regularly regardless of what the master, chief 
      officer and chief engineer did. <br>
      Tomas Rasmusson, who is one of N&T's own chief engineers, assisted the N&T

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- With the exception 
    of the unscheduled drydockings due to the leaking stern tube seals in March 
    and April 1993, the vessel under the management of N&T was only once at the 
    Yard and in drydock, i.e. in January 1994 in Turku, when the stabilisers were 
    installed and the ice paint was touched up the last time. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At that time 
    the B.V. surveyor Anders Wirstam carried out a Load Line Survey, which normally

      At that time Ulf Hobro knew very well from the specification of the previous

      of the visor, which was never carried out. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- This was said to 
    be the last time that Ulf Hobro had been inside the closed visor near the 
    Atlantic lock. There were smaller leakages of the hydraulic cylinders of the 
    Atlantic lock and the side locks as well as the bow ramp, which were said 
    to be normal according to him. Larger hydraulic oil leakages inside the visor

      spoke to ESCO and the result was the 'Explanatory Note' with sketch dated

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is revealed in 
    this memorandum that the crew experienced problems with the magnetic switches 
    between the spring of 1994 and September 1994 to the effect that the green 
    light did not go on if the bolt was closed. The problem was said to be solved 
    by a simple adjustment of the magnetic switch. These problems were mentioned 
    already by Henrik Sillaste and Tanel Moosaar during the interview on 10.03.95 
    in Stockholm see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.174.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    information received by one of the Finnish engineers from one of the Estonian 
    engineers shortly after the casualty the magnetic switches had actually been 
    destroyed by ice hacking already in February/March 1994 and were not replaced, 
    because crew members had to go down anyway to hammer close and open the bolt 
    of the Atlantic lock - see statement Arvi Myyryläinen <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.175.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.175</a> - and therefore it was decided not to renew the switches for 
    the time being.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Stabilisers 
    were installed into pockets already arranged at newbuilding with respective 
    electrical connections. The installation - according to Hobro - became necessary 
    after less than one year in service to be able to compete also in this respect 
    with the Helsinki ferries from Silja and Viking.</font></p>

        a matter of fact, Hobro had asked the Turku Repair Yard already in April 
        1993 to quote for the installation of stabilisers, i.e. after less than 
        3 months in service the management had to realise that the vessel was 
        now trading in a completely different sea area with a much rougher sea

        which - according to Henrik Sillaste - had caused damage and had cut the 
        short time planned for installation of the stabilisers at the shipyard 
        even shorter. Reportedly the required careful welding work to install 
        the starboard stabiliser therefore could not be carried out as it otherwise

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I'm not quite 
        certain of the exact date, but one afternoon after half past four I was 
        busy with painting the bow visor on the deck. As the bow is in raised 
        position only in Tallinn, I was painting the part that was otherwise not 
        visible. Before painting I had also polished and primed the visor. While 
        painting, I once again could not help noticing the cracks in the bow visor 
        fastenings, which were the result of the fatigue of metal. When repainting 
        the bow visor, I noticed them too. The cracks were visible only with the 
        bow in raised position. The starboard side fastening mechanism/box of 
        the visor had a crack of nearly 10 cm in length. The port side one had 
        a 6 cm long crack. There was also a crack in the welding between the bow 
        visor and the fastening beam, which was about 2 cm long. I am prepared 
        to show the location of the cracks on drawings.«</i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: When were observations 
    made of cracks in the visor of "Estonia"? <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: I 
    observed them while painting on the bow deck of the "Estonia" in early August 
    1994. Painting was done in the port of Tallinn.<br>
    Q: In what position was the visor when you were working? <br>
    A: The visor was open, otherwise we could not have seen the cracks.<br>
    Q: What colours did you paint? <br>
    A: Both green and white (i.e. both the deck surface and areas rising from 
    the deck).<br>
    Q: Can you show on the visor where the cracks were?<br>
    A: Those parts have been removed, this is why I cannot show the crack locations.</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    (Upon instructions of Börje Stenström the hinge remains had been removed for 
    metallographic investigations and mechanical testing already in January, that 
    is why the crack locations could not be demonstrated.) <br>
    <i>Q: Could you indicate on these sketches where the cracks were?<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: You 
    have to look from forward to aft at the hinges to be able to see the cracks 
    in the welding seams between the bushings and the hinge plates of the visor 
    hinges (hinges at the visor). The cracks were opposite to the deck when the 
    visor was closed. At the starboard hinge there were cracks in both welds. 
    At port side there was only one crack in the weld. The drawing below shows 
    the location and approximate length of the cracks. </font></i></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: Could you tell 
    us a bit more in detail about the paint work and the damage to the visor?<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: Actually 
    the damage could only be seen when the visor was open. There were very many. 
    On a drawing one could see that more in detail. Actually at one side there 
    were these cracks. Possibly as a result of mechanical action.<br>
    Q: You said on one side the crack was 10 cm long and on the other side about 
    6 cm long? This is written in your statement.<br>
    A: This might have been so.<br>
    Q: Quite sometime has passed but I assume that you are not going to withdraw 
    your written statement?<br>
    A: No.<br>
    A: I did not inform the boatswain about my observations. It was the time when 
    the cars were rolling on board. And the boatswain ... you had to work with 
    him. He did observe exactly. He disliked it if somebody did not work during 
    his working time. Then I did not get a chance to tell him. I was actually 
    of the opinion that it was known anyway. Therefore I forgot to report it.<br>
    Q: What was the condition of the visor when you started to work?<br>
    A: I did not have specific instructions to do something at a particular location. 
    During my work I was climbing everywhere, cleaned and painted. This location 
    was difficult to reach. Presumably the last time this area had been painted 
    was when the vessel was painted white for the first time. I thought that certainly 
    somebody from the administration knew about the cracks because the vessel 
    was checked quite often. Also the boatswain checked our work. Therefore I 
    believe that certainly somebody knew of the cracks.<br>
    Q: Thus you were convinced that due to the frequent checks that somebody knew 
    about the condition of the visor and also of the cracks? <br>
    A: Yes, I was sure that they knew it. <br>
    Q: Did the crack appear only after you had removed the paint? <br>
    A: No, the crack was visible already before.<br>
    Q: It was consequently enough to climb there to see the crack?<br>
    A: Yes. </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of these 
    three statements it has to be concluded that the welding seams between the 
    bushings and hinge plates of the visor hinges were visibly cracked up to 10 
    cm at the beginning of August 1994, less than 8 weeks before the casualty.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The photo below 
    shows a part cut out of the bushing recovered by divers from the wreck. It 
    is most probably the starboard inner bushing as will be explained in Chapter 
    30.</font></p>

    of stb. inner bushing recovered by divers</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding, 
    the relevant parts have been numbered as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 = steel bushing 
      <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2 = hinge

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3 = area 
      between hinge plate/bushing<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 = welding 
      material <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 = arrow 
      pointing to the large gap between bushing and hinge plate <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">6 = welding 
      seams between bushing/hinge plate</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Without going too 
    much into detail, already now attention has to be drawn to some very obvious 
    irregularities, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The bushing had 
    been too small for the bore of the hinge plate (2), therefore a gap (5) remained 
    between bushing and inner surface of the hinge plate. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding 
    seams (6) are rather weak compared to the dimension of hinge plate and bushing. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There had 
    obviously been a crack at the left side in the welding seam (4) which had 
    been tried to be closed by welding. This led to the accumulation of welding 
    material inside the gap between bushing / hinge plate. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The surface 
    area between hinge plate/bushing (3) is severely corroded which would not 
    have been possible if the inside had been airtight by intact welding seams. 
    In other words, the apparent fact that the space between bushing/hinge plate 
    could be attacked by corrosion as found is proof that the welding seams had 
    been cracked over the full thickness for a longer time already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) That there was 
    something seriously wrong at least with the starboard hinge arrangement of 
    the visor well before the casualty becomes very obvious when having a close 
    look at the<b> video film made by a passenger upon departure from Tallinn 
    on 17 September 1994</b>, i.e. 10 days before ESTONIA's last sailing. He stood 
    on the open forepart of the 8th deck and with his video camera filmed the 
    closing of the visor. Thereby he zoomed in on the starboard hinge arrangement. 
    The subsequent evaluation of the video proved that the starboard visor hinges 
    were totally misaligned with the lower part of the outer bushing as well as 
    the securing plate missing. The video was analysed and evaluated in detail 
    by the Reconnaissance Expert Bryan Roberts of Churchgate/UK and his report 
    is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    and misalignment of the starboard hinge is clearly visible to everybody, the

    12.5.181.1</a>, which evidently shows the same. Nevertheless, the Intelligence 
    people declared the whole film to be unreliable since 5 out of about 800 sequences 
    had been slightly "jumping", which was accepted by the JAIC as well as N&T 
    and the film from then on was ignored by the JAIC and consequently is also 
    not mentioned in their Report. What the film really shows becomes clear on

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the gap between 
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (Arrow 
    1).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the outer 
    bushing is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (Arrow

    beginning of August 1994 immediately after he had learned of the casualty 
    to his uncle, who was then sailing as chief officer for ESCO, and the uncle 
    went to the police who subsequently interrogated the student on 03.10.94, 
    it is difficult to believe that Rain Oolmets had remained silent on the real 
    damage to the starboard hinge, had it been there already.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, 
    he had told Klaus Rahka during the questioning at Hangö on 24.03.95 that he 
    had painted the visor hinges green and white and - as clearly visible on the 
    video image on the following page showing the starboard hinge bolt - there 
    is quite a lot of green paint on the bolt which could not possibly have got 
    there as long as the hinges were in their original, intact condition because 
    then it was practically a closed system, i.e. paint could not reach the bolt. 
    The intact system has no gap as can be seen from the drawing below showing 
    the intact starboard hinge arrangement.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg326.jpg" width="457" height="164"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it is, however, 
    obvious from the video print below, showing the starboard bolt - without bushing 
    - resting on the rail bar, there is a stripe of green paint at the bolt. Measurements 
    reveal that the paint is in way of the gap between the outer bushing and the 
    vessel hinge plate which is visible on the enlarged video print on the previous 
    page (Arrow 1).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg327.jpg" width="298" height="205"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore it has 
    to be concluded that the gap must have been there already when the green paint 
    was applied, however, this will be evaluated more in detail in Chapter 29/30. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Oolmets commenced 
    his job mid July 1994 and left the vessel on the 11 September 1994. He had 
    discovered up to 10 cm long cracks in the weldings between bushings and visor 
    hinge plates both at port side and starboard side of the visor hinges when 
    the visor was open. This was in early August, at a time after 16.30 hours 
    when the loading of the trucks had already commenced. The boatswain then on 
    board was Vello Ruben, thus it was the Andresson crew. Considering the fact 
    that the Andresson and Piht crews relieved each other every 14 days, further 
    that the Andresson crew would have been relieved on the 29.09.94, thus came 
    on board on 15 September 1994, going back from that date in 14-day intervals, 
    it becomes obvious that the early August time for the Andresson crew with 
    Vello Ruben as boatswain ended on 4 August 1994 in Tallinn. As on that day 
    the crews would change in the morning, the loading of the trucks after 16.30 
    hrs was already attended by the boatswain of the relief crew, Heino Leik. 
    As on the day before, 3 August 1994, the vessel had been in Stockholm, it 
    has to be concluded that Rain Oolmets found the cracks on<b> 2 August 1994 
    </b>as this is the only day in early August when Vello Ruben was on the car 
    deck after 16.30 hours. The Andresson crew returned on 18 August 1994, but 
    this date or later would hardly be considered early August by Rain Oolmets. 
    On 11 September 1994 he left the vessel (see time schedule of crew change 
    -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.182.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    12.5.182</a>).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If he had finished 
    painting the starboard hinges, which has to be assumed as he stayed on board 
    for another 6 weeks after discovery of the cracks in early August, there must 
    have been quite a gap between the inside of the outer visor hinge plate and 
    the outside of the outer hinge plate at the vessel's side, as otherwise it 
    would not have been possible for such green deck paint to reach the bolt.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This could 
    indicate that the repairs to the starboard hinges of the visor had already 
    been carried out when Rain Oolmets discovered the reported cracks on 2 August 
    1994. It would, of course, mean that he told the criminal police as well as 
    JAIC only part of the truth, which would not be surprising.</font></p>

    the statement of<b> 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür</b> he was also responsible for 
    all watertight (weathertight) openings of the vessel, their maintenance and 
    proper functioning. In his statement taken on 3 October 1994 by the Estonian 
    security police in Tallinn - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.5.183</a> - <b>Peeter Tüür</b>, who is the highest ranking officer

  <blockquote>

      responsibility to see that the visor was in order, but I was specifically 
      responsible for the hydraulic of the visor. The closing of the visor was 
      carried out by the boatswain, however, I am unaware who was directly responsible 
      for the closing, possibly the mate. <b>Behind the visor is the ramp. This 
      should also be hermetically tight, there are just a few places where the

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was initially 
    the intention of this 'Group of Experts' to ignore the different statements 
    made by <b>Silver Linde </b>completely because his "evidence" had obviously 
    been influenced by his ESCO superiors, in particular by Enn Neidre, the head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO and safety adviser of Estline and simultaneously 
    member of the Estonian part of the JAIC until April 1996, whereafter he remained 
    to be an expert to JAIC. An example of this is Silver Linde's interview by 
    the JAIC at the so-called "Landvetter meeting" on 31 March 1995, which Enn 
    Neidre, in spite of strong objections by the Swedes and Finns, had insisted 
    on attending by pointing to his membership in the Estonian part of JAIC. He 
    actually attended in a blue captain's uniform, which he had never done before 
    and never did thereafter. </font></p>

    <i>"I came down to the car deck in the middle, went aft at first, turned the 
    key, walked forward towards the ramp, a couple of meters away from the bow 
    ramp heard strong crashing noise, I told the bridge by walkie-talkie about 
    the noise and got the order to remain and check what it is all about. I stayed 
    there for 5 minutes and controlled in the vicinity, what I could see. After 
    that I opened the doors in front of the panel and all lights were green. I 
    asked for permission from the bridge to go on with my round, which was granted."

      at the time when Kadak was in the ECR and saw water penetrating the bow 
      ramp. The communication between Silver Linde/bridge via walkie-talkie should 
      have been overheard by the watch engineer Treu, who has not stated anything 
      in this respect in any of his 12 known statements and interviews. What he 
      stated, however, in all but two of these twelve statements/interviews is 
      that he heard Silver Linde report to the bridge that there was<b> water 
      on car deck</b>. Safety officer Ervin Roden also overheard the walkie-talkie 
      communication between Silver Linde and the bridge. Ervin Roden had been 
      sleeping in his cabin with the walkie-talkie on when he suddenly heard Silver 
      Linde shouting to the bridge that there was<b> quite a lot of water on the 
      car deck</b> and that they had to abandon the vessel. (See the memos made

      the security adviser of Estline, Captain Enn Neidre, who obviously was not 
      aware of this respectively not acquainted with the installation. After this 
      'Group of Experts' had explained in writing to the JAIC the different functions 
      and meanings of the indicator lights, the consultant of the Estonian part 
      of the JAIC, Professor Jaan Metsaveer, tried to correct the already existing 
      impression that the Estonians did not know how their relevant safety installations 
      functioned, by stating at a joint meeting of the JAIC and this 'Group of 
      Experts' that the explanation for "all lights were green" was the fact that 
      the careful boatswain always closed the harbour securing at sea<b> to avoid 
      any lights being red</b>. After presentation of the video print below, from 
      one of the underwater videos showing the harbour securing open, the professor

    a crash behind the ramp</b>, then at the hearing by JAIC on 17.10.94 and on 
    17.11.94 he explained the noise to have been<b> just slightly louder than 
    the normal ones created by wave impact </b>respectively that he <b>could hear 
    the noise only because he was just 1.5 m away</b> from the ramp and he would 
    not <b>have heard it if he would have been 10-20 m away</b>; at the Landvetter 
    hearing on 31.03.95 it became <b>a beating (not a scraping) noise </b>and, 
    finally, in his last testimony on 25.01.96 -<b> the noise was remarkable and 
    not typical for ship/wave contact and he had never heard it before or thereafter</b>, 
    which is actually in agreement with what 3rd engineer Margus Treu had said 
    from the beginning, although had always mentioned at least 2 extraordinary

    likely been something at <b>about 00.45 hours</b> and that he subsequently 
    changed the time according to the requirements of his principals which becomes 
    very obvious in his last statements when he puts the time at<b> 00.50/00.55 
    hours</b> because at that time JAIC had already decided to keep the time between 
    the first notification to the bridge and the very late Mayday as short as 
    possible;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the whole story 
    about his observations on the car deck at this time is fabricated anyway,

    trying to hold the visor and the bow ramp.</font></li>

    the controls for the bow ramp could only be operated by a special key which 
    was in the possession of the boatswain</b>, (the controls are in the same 
    box as the control lights which should have been locked), thus it has to be

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the 
    above analysis the following conclusions have to be drawn:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) There had certainly 
    been bangs/crashes on the car deck at about 00.45 hours, but definitely not 
    just one. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) Silver Linde 
    must have noted a lot of water on the car deck at about this time or earlier 
    and certainly reported this to the bridge. It is possible that he looked into 
    the control panel and thereby also looked at the control lights which were 
    certainly not all green because definitely the bow ramp was not properly locked 
    and the harbour securing was open. The control panel must have been open because 
    the boatswain was working on the hydraulic cylinders of the visor and bow 
    ramp. In this connection his remark made on 3 December 1994 has to be understood, 
    that the <b>controls for the bow ramp could only be operated by a special 
    key which was in the possession of the boatswain.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) If Silver Linde 
    really went back to the bridge it must have been at 01.00 hours or just before 
    because the big heel occurred at 01.02 hours according to the clock of Mikael 
    Öun, and less than 5 minutes later Per-Erik Ehrnsten already saw him coming 
    out of the port inner alleyway on deck 7 walking into the forward central 
    stairway (details later on). It is possible that Linde went down to the Information 
    desk just after 01.00 hours - helped the elderly couple on deck 7, which took 
    about a minute according to his own statement, continued to deck 5 and was 
    at the Information desk when the big heel occurred, whereafter he pushed up 
    to the crew accommodation on deck 7. According to Per-Erik Ehrnsten Linde 
    was talking into his walkie-talkie all the time even when he fell and the 
    other two crew members who were with him - presumably Aulis Lee and Aldo Metspalu 
    - helped him back on to his feet and later out on to the deck. It is doubtful 
    and also unimportant whether he ever went down to deck 4 since it is highly 
    doubtful that he ever got an order from the bridge to go down to the car deck, 
    because since 00.45 hours or earlier it was known to those on watch that there 
    was water on the car deck and it is most probable that 2nd mate Peter Kannuussaar 
    and the nautical advisor Juri Aavik were already on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) This could be 
    the confirmation for a remark made by Linde which he made only once, viz. 
    that <b>he was sent down to the Information desk to advise them to alarm the 
    passengers.</b> It is also amazing that he admitted to having looked at his 
    watch<b> at 01.24 hours when he was already in the liferaft and the vessel 
    was on the side </b>bearing in mind that <b>the first "Mayday" was only picked-up 
    at 01.22 hours </b>and the<b> 3rd mate Andres Tammes was telling SILJA EUROPA 
    at 01.25 that the list was 20°/30° to the right side.</b> Even if Silver Linde's 
    watch had been wrong by 2-3 minutes the discrepancy is remarkable, i.e. just 
    when the mates had finally decided to transmit the "Mayday" at least A.B. 
    sailor Linde was already in the liferaft. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) This means also 
    that some of the AB's had left the vessel already at a stage when more or 
    less all the passengers and other crew members were still on board, because 
    at 01.24 hours the heel was probably between 50°-60°. Also Einar Kukk - who 
    was rather early outside on deck 7 - has testified that Silver Linde was already 
    in the liferaft when he went forward. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Margus Treu is one 
    of the three survivors considered by the JAIC to be the key witnesses and, 
    thus, was questioned in detail, however, in the presence of the head of the 
    nautical department of ESCO and safety adviser of ESTLINE, Captain Enn Neidre, 
    who was then still a member of the Estonian part of the JAIC and as such insisted 
    on participating despite the urgent requests of the Swedish and Finnish members 
    to stay home. When the psychological expert of the JAIC, the Swede Bengt Schager, 
    was interviewed by Jutta Rabe of Spiegel TV in this connection, he replied 
    the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Q:<i> Hannes 
      Kadak has withdrawn that he saw water coming in at 00.46 hrs, which he withdrew 
      later. He first made a very precise statement and later withdrew it. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: <i>Oh, yes, 
      you mean that statement, yes. Ah, it was revealed during the Landvetter 
      investigation, when I was asking him and I don't have any explanation to 
      what he said, but I was very curious, because first he said that he had 
      thought about it and wasn't sure anymore and 1 minute later he wasn't sure 
      at all whether he had said so at all. So, I don't know what to believe of 
      that. I am in the hands of the witness, sometimes.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Q:<i> But can 
      it be that confusion was caused, that there were people on behalf of the 
      Shipping Company who were employed there, who were also attending that meeting 
      and Mr. Neidre was more or less like a boss for him, and people do get insecure 
      when being asked. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: (nodding) <i>Yes, 
      and <b>Mr. Neidre was in full uniform as well for the first time that I 
      have seen it. </b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Q: <i><b>But was 
      that very smart?</b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A:<b><i> I don't 
      think so, but we had no option, this was the way the Estonians wanted it. 
      Although I had some feelings about it, he was a member of the Commission, 
      I could not say to him, please, I want to talk with him alone. This may 
      have altered some of the responses in the interview, yes.« </i></b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that Captain 
    Enn Neidre, working ashore in the ESCO administration for many years, <b>had 
    without doubt deliberately put on his captain's uniform to intimidate the 
    crew witnesses and, looking at the answers they have given, he did it successfully. 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence, 
    Treu said less than he had said in his initial statements and stuck to his 
    impossible wrong timing, on which, however, the JAIC has built up their equally 
    impossible casualty scenario. Margus Treu, who is indeed the key witness, 
    because he apparently saw on the monitor how the bow ramp was struck and broke 
    open, because this is what he told motorman Hannes Kadak in explanation of 
    the water ingress on to the car deck according to the first statement of Kadak 
    made on 29 September 1994 to the Finnish criminal police in Turku when he 
    said:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»- suddenly 
      the vessel heeled to starboard, he ran back to the ECR where Treu was watching 
      the monitor and said:<b> "The situation is serious" or "bad" "because the 
      ramp has been struck and became broken." - </b>saw on the monitor that there 
      were high waves on the car deck and that the water level had already reached 
      the height of the personal cars.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was not mentioned 
    by any of the JAIC members at the Landvetter meeting, although it concerns 
    one of the topics of the casualty sequence-of-events. The JAIC members instead 
    spent their time with intimidating Kadak to the effect that he withdrew his 
    initial and very precise statement <i>"that at 00.46 hours he saw water penetrating 
    the bow ramp at the upper starboard corner".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In detail:<br>
    <b>(1) on 28.09.94 at 10.03 hours by the Central Criminal Police, Turku:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- felt 3-4 heavy 
      bangs and when the camera turned to the bow, saw very much water entering 
      from that direction;</font></p>

      of 10°-15° (from previously 1°-2°); </font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- they tried to 
      pump out the water that was entering the ship. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    above short statement implies two circumstances: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) when Treu felt 
    the heavy bangs/blows, the monitor either did not show the bow ramp (because 
    the system was still switched to the rotating mode) or he was somewhere else 
    in the ECR, thus he states: <i>"When the camera turned to the bow, I saw very 
    much water entering from that direction." </i>There might well have been some 
    time between him feeling the impacts and seeing the water penetrate at the 
    bow ramp which does not exclude that at the time of the impacts water was 
    already penetrating the bow ramp. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Treu states 
    that there was only water on the car deck, not in the engine room, but goes 
    on to say that they tried to pump out the water that was entering the ship. 
    Since it is not possible to pump water from the car deck, water must have 
    been in some compartments in the vessel which were pumpable, i.e. 1st deck 
    and/or 0-deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) on 28.09.94

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    statement was most probably made before anyone from ESCO or the JAIC had spoken 
    to him and can thus be considered uninfluenced. It is the only of the official 
    statements in which he testifies to have felt the two double, hard bangs at 
    about 01.00 hours. At 01.15 hours he certainly saw water entering the car 
    deck via the ramp, but he does not say whether he looked at the monitor straight 
    after the bangs. Actually water had already penetrated the ramp before 01.00 
    hours. If he saw it for the first time, his timing must be wrong by 13-15 
    minutes, unless he did not look at the monitor before because he was busy 
    with other matters, e.g. the starboard stabiliser. This is also confirmed 
    by his statement that the list at 01.30 hours was 45°, which it actually was 
    already at ca. 01.15 hours, whilst at 01.30 hours the vessel was on the side 
    or was almost on the side, as confirmed by many survivors, e.g. trainee mate 
    Einar Kukk who looked at his watch. </font></p>

    that at the ramp itself and its sides there were no sealings. This means that 
    the ramp was there and visible, but at the sides and underneath water was 
    pressing through as if there were no sealings. This implies that the ramp 
    was open to some extent and it remained open since then, because when Treu 
    looked at the monitor after the bangs, water was already penetrating the ramp 
    and certainly had penetrated the ramp for quite some time already which had 
    not been noted by Treu not looking on the monitor all the time.</font></li>

      Did anyone there watch the monitor? He noticed water entering under high

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Watch Estonian 
      time 24.00-04.00. Speed after 2400 was about 14.7-15 knots. Shortly after 
      the accident the speed was reduced. Port ME before the accident was running 
      at 560 rmp's. After the accident it was running at 500 rpm's and the speed 
      was 10-11 knots. Treu did not note any vibrations, indicating that the vessel 
      was turning after the accident. According to the ETA-Pilot the normal speed 
      of the vessel was 580-600 rpm's. <b>Linde was seen on the monitor at 01.00, 
      coming from the pumping station for the visor and ramp</b>. The bridge ordered 
      us to pump ballast when the ship had heeled. When the ME's and Aux's stopped 
      the bridge asked if we could pump out freshwater. 01.20 or 01.21 "Mr. Skylight". 
      01.20-01.25 ME's stopped due to heel. First Port, then Stb'd ME's stopped 
      due to low oil pressure. Treu left the ECR at 01.30-01.32 when the Aux's 
      had stopped. On (=when looking at) the monitor the ramp seemed to be in 
      its correct position when water entered the car deck around the (ramp) edges. 
      The 4th Engineer had the watch 20.00-24.00 on the Estonian coast. He may 
      have information on the vessel's speed. The ship started heeling when water 
      entered the car deck. When Treu left the ECR the list was 70°-75°. Treu 
      did not observe any heel of the vessel first to one and then to the other 
      side, for instance first to Stb'd and then P and finally back to Stb'd. 
      The ship was thus according to Treu heeling to Stb'd at all times. The 3rd 
      Engineer always had the 00.00-04.00 watch. The propeller pitch could be 
      seen from the ECR. Treu did not observe any change in pitch. When the ship's 
      stern sank the vessel came towards Treu. Treu was in the water on the Stb'd 
      side by the funnel. When he got into a lifeboat the ship's stern was already 
      deep down. The ship was upright (same Finnish word for upright = stern down 
      / stern up, as for upright = no heel, Peter's note). The lights went out 
      at 01.30. The emergency generator functioned at greater angles of heel than 
      the Aux's. The lube oil level in the engines was higher than normal. The 
      emergency generator stopped when the heel was great, almost 90°. When the 
      emergency generator stopped the accumulator batteries took over. There was 
      light until the vessel sank. Treu did not see Linde except on the monitor, 
      but overheard his report to the bridge. Treu is positive that Linde reported 
      to the bridge. Treu cannot estimate when the vessel sank, maybe at 01.45-02.00. 
      Linde reported water on the car deck at 01.15. He did not say how much or 
      how the water was entering the car deck. Treu kept the camera fixed on the 
      bow ramp. There were no observations of water on the lower passenger deck. 
      When the camera showed the bow ramp the same picture was also displayed 
      on the bridge monitor on the Stb'd side of the chart room. Water entered 
      the car deck along the sides of the ramp under great pressure. Water flew 
      all the way on to the video camera lens. Treu did not observe water leaking 
      along the upper edge of the ramp. Partly the upper part of the ramp was 
      visible on the monitor. Treu was not able to say whether he could have observed 
      water entering along the upper edge. The stabilising fins were deployed 
      at 00.30.«</i></font></p>

      Next the bridge asked whether it would be possible to pump freshwater overboard 
      which it was not because there was no more power for the pumps.<br>
      I informed the bridge that I was also going up now to check the emergency 
      generator, which stopped after a short while when the vessel was on the 
      side and the batteries took over the supply of the emergency lights. <b>The 
      main engines shut off at a heel angle of more than 45° and less than 70°.<br>
      The auxiliaries stopped at a heel of 70° and the emergency generator at 
      90°. <br>
      It took maximal 10 minutes from the time the auxiliaries stopped to being 
      in the water.<br>
      At 01.35/40 I left the engine room. <br>
      Apparently the engine output as well as the pitch had been reduced before 
      the big heel.<br>
      It is possible that the port engines did not shut off automatically, but 
      were stopped from the bridge.</b><br>
      There has always been maintenance work by the crew to the visor, bow ramp 
      and locking devices as well as hydraulic cylinders for which 2nd engineer 
      Peeter Tüür was responsible.<br>
      <b>Elmar Siegel saw the emergency lifeboat No. 1 - starboard side, the first 
      boat - after the heel in the water with lights on driving away without caring 
      for those in the water. «</b></font></i></p>

  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Olle Noord:</b>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above indicates 
    that Treu, who is probably the only one to know exactly what happened, does 
    not believe that the stabilisers were out, at least not during the final stage 
    when the speed had dropped below 4 knots. It is the only indication in one 
    of the official documents that there might have been something wrong with 
    the stabilisers, because N&T/ ESCO and the crew remain silent on this, which 
    indicates that there might be some connection with the casualty.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the book 
    by Andi Meister, the Chairman of the JAIC until July 1996, it is stated in 
    Chapter 7 on page 134: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»At about 00.35 
    hours the watch engineer went into the engine room in order to get the stabilisers

    did not follow (did not move out).«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not stated 
    what was done to rectify the problem, but Margus Treu told the English journalist 
    Phillip Wearne in May 1998 that there had been a "stabiliser alarm" at about 
    00.30 hours, when the bridge tried to activate the stabilisers. It concerned 
    the starboard fin which did not move out and it took him and Sillaste ca. 
    5 minutes to activate this fin.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andi Meister 
    told Phillip Wearne subsequently that Henrik Sillaste did not confirm the 
    above and has refused to talk about it. Sillaste told the journalist, however, 
    that there had been major problems with the starboard stabiliser during the 
    installation when the vessel had been in drydock at Naantali the last time, 
    among other things; there had been a fire. The damage caused had to be repaired 
    during the already very short time available and the vessel sailed as planned, 
    however, without everything in way of the starboard stabiliser installation 
    being carried out in accordance with good workmanship as it should have been.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection 
    two remarks have to be made:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) At the time 
    of the casualty DIANA II was in the process of being taken over by N&T/ESCO 
    in Rostock. Some Estonian crew members were already on board, also Captain 
    Erik Moik as well as the representative of the Turku Repair Yard responsible 
    for the installation of the stabilisers on the ESTONIA. This man had become 
    very stressed upon hearing about the ESTONIA casualty, but then became very 
    relaxed when it was reported that the visor had broken off.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) One of the divers 
    spoke to a member of SEA and indicated that it is known why the casualty really 
    happened, viz. something relevant had been only "spot welded" instead of fully 
    welded and the element could thus not withstand the forces acting on it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the analysis 
    of the statements of the survivors from deck 1 the possibility that the starboard 
    stabiliser fin broke off and tore open the empty starboard heeling tank and/or 
    the auxiliary engine room compartment will have to be borne in mind, in particular 
    since recent reports from Tallinn state that there had been a lot of water 
    in the engine room which they had been unable to pump out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Treu was in the 
    ECR from the beginning of the casualty sequence-of-events up to the end; possibly 
    only interrupted by the time when he was working on the starboard stabiliser. 
    During the time when he was in the ECR he had two clocks in his immediate 
    vicinity in addition to his own wristwatch. Consequently, it has to be assumed 
    that at least his first time statements were relatively exact, whilst the 
    other times, e.g. when the vessel was on her side, were purely guessed. Later 
    he knew from the other survivors that this had been at about 01.30 hours and 
    said it was so when he was interviewed by Jutta Rabe. Therefore in his first 
    statement he stated the time for the two impacts to have been ca. 01.00 hours, 
    which is confirmed by many others, but later moved it back by some 15 minutes, 
    obviously under the influence of his superiors. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He has, however, 
    repeatedly stated that after having felt those two unusual impacts he immediately 
    went to the monitor and saw water streaming in respectively being pressed 
    through at the sides of the bow ramp, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly but not 
    fully open, because if the bow ramp had been pulled open by the visor broken-off 
    he could not have seen the bow ramp and certainly would not have stated that 
    water was streaming in at the sides. This does not exclude that water had 
    been streaming on to the car deck for some time already because he was not 
    looking to the monitor all the time, probably this was the first time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the 
    following might be concluded:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu heard 
        and felt the impacts, which were not caused by waves, at around 01.00 
        hours;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he went straight 
        to the monitor and saw water penetrating the bow ramp at both sides under 
        pressure, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly open because at that time the 
        ramp actuators had already been torn off the ramp and the ramp was being 
        held by the mooring line - see Chapter 19.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- simultaneously 
        or shortly thereafter Silver Linde reported the water ingress to the bridge, 
        i.e. he must have been on the car deck further aft - probably in the door 
        of the centre casing - where the camera did not pick him up and where 
        he saw the water ingress directly. This would mean that it was well before 
        01.00 hours, because the abrupt heel occurred at 01.02 hours and how else 
        could Linde be in the crew accommodation on 7th deck at ca. 01.05 hours?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu in his 
        statements 2 and 3 has probably deliberately moved the times backwards 
        by some 10 to 15 minutes; this becomes most obvious when he states - in 
        his interview to Jutta Rabe of March 1995 - that the auxiliaries only 
        stopped when the list was about 45° and that then it was 01.30 hours when 
        the vessel was actually on her starboard side and that he, himself, was 
        already on deck. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The authors 
        of the book 'Katastrofen Kurs', Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, who 
        had early access to the initially confidential protocols and working papers 
        of the Swedish part of the JAIC, have revealed that also JAIC had formed 
        the opinion that Treu's timing was impossible. The authors explain this 
        with <i>"Treu's loyalty to Estline which apparently increased all the 
        more as time went on" </i>(last paragraph on page 157). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The authors continue

        at Landvetter he reconfirms: "... the last time I looked at the clock 
        was at 00.30 hours (note: Swedish time) and then the auxiliaries had just 
        stopped."<br>
        This, however, is not possible, because Andres Tammes had told the SILJA 
        EUROPA in the course of the distress communi-cation already at 01.25 hours 
        that they had a blackout and therefore could not state their position. 
        But there cannot be a 'blackout' as long as the auxiliaries are running. 
        Even the Estonian Commission admitted that "there has to be something 
        wrong with Treu's statements as to the times, apparently in connection 
        with the alarm clock (in the engine room) ... there is a mistake of between 
        5 and 8 minutes ...".«</i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The psychologist 
      Bengt Schager, expert to the Swedish part of the JAIC, also stated:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Margus Treu's 
        exactness in question of times is questionable ... Margus Treu is about 
        10 minutes too late in his time statements.«</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In the opinion 
      of this 'Group of Experts' his timing at least 15 minutes late, and his 
      loyalty towards Estline is also demonstrated by the obvious fact that in 
      none of his statements does he say anything about his observation why the 
      bow ramp was slightly open thus enabling water to penetrate the gaps at 
      both sides from the full visor on to the car deck, viz. just what he told 
      Hannes Kadak after Kadak entered the ECR following the abrupt heeling to 
      starboard: <i>"Tillständet är allvarligt" eller "dälig", "efterson rampen 
      har slagit sönder." </i>This translated means: <i>"The situation is dangerous/serious, 
      because the ramp has been struck and become broken."</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - It is amazing 
      that the JAIC has ignored this important observation which, fortunately, 
      Kadak testified in his first, obviously uninfluenced, statement. Instead 
      the JAIC has endeavoured, successfully, to weaken Kadak's precise statement 
      (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.5.284.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      21.2.5.284</a>) that he saw water penetrating the bow ramp at the starboard 
      upper side already at 00.46 hours, which is most likely the truth bearing 
      in mind the full visor and the conditions of the bow ramp (see statement 
      2nd engineer Peeter Tüür dated 03.10.94 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The most probable 
      explanation for Treu's observation that the bow ramp was struck and became 
      broken can be found in Chapter 32.</font></p>

    loyalty to Estline and ESCO Margus Treu gave a very important indication by 
    stating that the water being pressed through the sides of the bow ramp reached 
    the lens of the video camera fitted at the upper forepart of the centre casing. 
    As the distance between the bow ramp and the centre casing is 27 m this is 
    technically not possible and the water smashing against the camera lens must 
    have come from somewhere else, the drencher system. It has to be assumed that 
    the drencher system on the car deck as well as the fire alarm were activated 
    and the nozzles fitted under deck also between the bow ramp and the centre 
    casing were spraying water under pressure also on the camera lens. As this 
    did definitely happen before 01.00 hours Margus Treu's timing has to be adjusted 
    accordingly. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, Henrik 
    Sillaste had made various statements to journalists, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The first one 
    was published already on 28.09.94 at 15.57 hours Finnish time: <i>»According 
    to an Estonian machine operator,<b> Henrik Sillaste</b>, who managed to escape 
    from the ship through a funnel, the <b>gate of the car deck was for some reason 
    left slightly open and water came to the deck through it.</b> The body of 
    water, weighing many tons, that got inside the ferry made it very unstable, 
    and the wind and the size of the waves (according to the reports as high as 
    10 metres) were enough to push the ship to its side.«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - On 29.09.94 the 
    following was published in a Helsinki newspaper:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Motorman <b>Henrik 
    Sillaste</b> (25), translation:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Soon after 
      midnight "Estonia's" forepart sunk heavily. I watched the car deck via the 
      video control system and saw <b>that water rushed in through the bow door, 
      which earlier has had problems</b>. At this moment the water already stood 
      knee-deep on the car deck. Thereafter "Estonia" rapidly listed over. The 
      2 main engines stopped soon thereafter, but the auxiliary engines were still 
      running.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sillaste has maintained 
    this observation, viz. that the bow ramp was slightly open when he looked 
    at the monitor for the first time in the Engine Control Room (ECR), during 
    all his statements. Although he is expressing himself very carefully and has, 
    after the first three statements taken on 28/29 September 1994 at Turku, obviously 
    been prepared for possible further questioning concerning the visor and its 
    locking devices, however, apparently not in respect of the bow ramp. Also 
    the fact that he was not invited to attend the Landvetter meeting at the end 
    of March 1995 indicates that neither JAIC nor ESCO did consider him to be 
    a key witness. This apparently changed after this 'Group of Experts' had presented 
    his detailed evidence, including the drawing he had made showing the slightly 
    open bow ramp with water pressing through at both sides, to JAIC in the course 
    of the joint meetings held during the second half of 1995.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already in January 
    1996 he was again interrogated by the Estonian security police when he made 
    another drawing showing the same condition of the slightly open bow ramp with 
    water pressing through at both sides. Both drawings are shown below.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - first there was

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(8) in April 
    1998</b> - Interview by Christian Jungbluth:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- there were 
    3 bangs, most of the others forget the first one, which was the weakest one, 
    there were about 30 seconds between them, and the 3rd one was the strongest;</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he assumes 
    that the vessel righted up again after the 1st and 2nd bangs (he calls the 
    "bangs" "beats" or "blows" and associates each "bang" with a heeling movement, 
    the bangs came from forward;</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after the<b> 3rd 
    most heavy bang the vessel heeled excessively to starboard</b> and the plastic 
    containers slid down to the starboard side and he rushed to the ECR;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- he did not 
    see water penetrate the bow ramp, saw only the roofs of the cars, never saw 
    water as long as he was in the ECR;</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - when he entered 
    the ECR 2 of the 4 main engines had shut off already;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the water tight 
    doors were closed; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- tried to phone

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(9) in May 1998 
    </b>- Interview by Phillip Wearne:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - there were <b>3 
    strong blows, following one after the other but much quicker than wave blows 
    do and which were different to wave blows;</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after the 3rd 
    blow the ship heeled quite heavily</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    and he knew that something must be wrong;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - rushed towards 
    the ECR;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>looked at the 
    monitor and saw water rushing in at both sides of the bow ramp,</b> the first 
    thought was that something was wrong with visor and bow ramp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>then 2 of the 
    4 main engines had already stopped</b>, then there was an attempt to pump 
    the ballast but this was a failure;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>the heel increased 
    continuously clicking like the second hand of a wrist</b> watch;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - next also the 
    other 2 main engines stopped while the auxiliaries continued to run;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- tried to contact 
    the chief engineer but telephone had fallen down;</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - just before 
    the auxiliaries shut off there was the "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" message 
    followed by the general alarm;</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he refers to what 
    he said right after the accident, he might mix up things now;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - when they were 
    between the 4th/6th deck the electricity went off and 2-3 seconds later the 
    emergency generator started to work and they continued to deck 8, had problems 
    opening the door at the port side because the heel was already some 70° and 
    it was above their heads, managed finally to open the door by pressing their 
    backs against it;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the emergency 
    exit was well constructed by the yard, it was quite narrow, thus they could 
    lean with their backs against the left wall and climb all the way up, if it 
    had been wider, they would have just fallen down;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw 2nd/3rd mates 
    leaving the bridge after the Tyfon signal - did not see them again;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- ran (after 
    the heel) through the auxiliary engine room, the storage room, main engine 
    room and in these 4 rooms there was no water.</b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of Henrik 
    Sillaste's various statements the following has to be concluded:<br>
    Due to his observations and respective statements Henrik Sillaste is one of 
    the key witnesses of the case. His statement: <i><b>"that the bow ramp was 
    only slightly open at a time when the vessel had already heeled abruptly to 
    starboard"</b></i> is crucial for the cause consideration, because obviously 
    the big heel had not been caused<i> "by large quantities of water flooding 
    onto car deck through the bow ramp having been pulled open by the forward 
    tumbling visor" </i>as alleged by the JAIC.<br>
    Also his timing was quite good in the first statements but was changed possibly 
    as consequence of influence of his principals, as evidenced by his statement 
    taken by the Estonian security police on 04.10.1994. <br>
    <b>As a matter of fact, it was Henrik Sillaste who told a member of this 'Group 
    of Experts' in March 1995 that all the crew survivors had been threatened 
    to be immediately sacked by ESCO if they said anything against ESCO's interests 
    to Commission members, journalists or other interested parties and this had 
    scared all the of the crew survivors considerably.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    in addition to the aforementioned statements about the slightly open bow ramp 
    he has made a number of interesting remarks: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- The lifeboat 
    lashings had been released in advance, which means that the vessel's command 
    had been aware for some time before the big heel at 01.02 hours that the ferry 
    was in danger of sinking. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The heavy impacts 
    - three in total, of which not everyone had felt the first one, but which 
    he had, having been so close - were not caused by waves</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When he came to 
    the ECR two of the four main engines had already stopped, i.e. at ca. 01.03/04 
    hours, and the other two followed shortly afterwards, the watertight doors 
    were closed and the bilge pumps were running. (Since bilge pumps can only 
    pump from sections below the car deck, i.e. 1st deck or 0-deck, they must 
    have pumped from one or both of these decks.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He could not phone 
    the chief engineer since the telephone had fallen down which - according to 
    Treu - also the monitor showing the bow ramp had done at some stage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He and Kadak left 
    the ECR upstairs already after having been there for only 5 minutes. Then 
    all four main engines had stopped already, but the diesel generators were 
    still running, possibly for another 1 or 2 minutes. This means that the main 
    engines had stopped already at about 01.10 hours or earlier and the diesel 
    generators stopped at about 01.12 hours, whereafter the emergency generator 
    in the funnel had started automatically, which among other things was also 
    supplying power to the bilge pumps. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Just before the 
    diesel generators stopped he heard the<i> "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2"</i> 
    alarm, which consequently must have been at about 01.10/01.11 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The testimony of 
    Henrik Sillaste further proves that the visor was full of water and remained 
    full, respectively refilled time and again,<b> because water continued to 
    stream on to the car deck no matter whether the bow was diving into waves 
    or not.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent 
    fact that there was something wrong with the vacuum system at about 00.30 
    hours is confirmed by the statement of Anneli Konrad, one of the dancing girls, 
    who has testified, inter alia:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>"At about 00.30 
      hours my performance was over and I was on my way to my cabin. I went wrong 
      and ended up on the 2nd car deck where I heard a crash. I found my cabin 
      finally feeling very sick. There was no water in the toilet."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The complete statement 
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.4.283.htm" target="_blank">

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) <b>on 29.09.94</b> 
    by the Estonian security police in Turku:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - commenced his 
      first watch ever in the engine room of ESTONIA at 00.00 hours, made an inspection 
      round of the engine room and returned to the ECR, whereafter Margus Treu 
      made his round;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - sometime later 
      the bridge ordered to activate the stabilisers;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- at 00.46 
      hours he saw a jet of water penetrating the right side of the bow ramp,</b> 
      and thought it was rain water, did not report it to anybody; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when Margus Treu 
      returned to the ECR Kadak went to the workshop next to the ECR and on same 
      deck, and did some work;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - suddenly the 
      vessel sank down and fell to starboard, he ran back to the ECR, where Treu 
      was watching the monitor and said:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>"The situation 
        is serious" or "bad" "because the ramp has been struck and became broken.";</b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw on the monitor 
      that there were high waves on the car deck and the water level had already 
      reached the height of the personal cars;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - thereafter the 
      light began to blink which meant "boat alarm";</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - then <b>Henrik 
      Sillaste came in </b>and the <b>watertight doors closed again;</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    means that the watertight doors were already closed when Henrik Sillaste arrived 
    1-2 minutes after the sharp heel to starboard. Since a sharp heel to starboard 
    is no reason to close the watertight door in the engine room, there must have 
    been something else and earlier which caused Margus Treu to close the watertight 
    doors, apparently without instructions from the bridge, because he has testified 
    that he had only had two communications with the bridge subsequently in relation 
    to pumping water to the high port side. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) <b>on 31.03.95</b> 
    by the JAIC members in Gothenburg: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Main subject of the 
    questioning of Hannes Kadak was his statement - obviously uninfluenced - made 
    on 29.09.94 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.5.284.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.2.5.284</a>) in Turku <b>that at 00.46 hours he had seen water penetrating 
    on the right side of the bow ramp. <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On pages 
    162 ff. of the book "<i>Katastrofen Kurs</i>" by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, 
    who had early access to the confidential protocol of the meeting, the Questions/Answers 
    quoted below developed: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»JAIC: Are these 
      statements correct?</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have 
      thought a lot about it in hindsight, but I cannot say if it was exactly 
      that way.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: You say 
      here that you saw water before midnight (Swedish time)?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have 
      thought it over and it can be totally wrong.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: We may 
      consequently consider it to be uncertain?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: Uncertain. 
      </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: Uncertain. 
      This can mean that it might have been so or it might not have been so. In 
      the statement it is written down that ".. at 23.46 hours I saw on the monitor 
      that water penetrated at the right side of the ramp". Is it correct that 
      you said so to the officer in charge of the interrogation? </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: It is 
      so that, after coming home, I have thought it over and it is so that I am 
      not so sure about it, and I have considered whether it could be wrong and 
      why could I say so. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: But you 
      did say so to the interpreter during the questioning on the 29th?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: After 
      I came ashore I have testified so many times.«</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At this stage 
      Enn Neidre, member of the Estonian part of JAIC and in a captain's full 
      dress uniform, interrupted the discussion:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Neidre: I 
      made notes at the hearing on 29 September and in these notes nowhere can 
      the time 23.46 hours be found.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It 
    is clear that Neidre never wrote down 23.46 hours as Kadak never said 23.46, 
    because he was talking in Estonian time and in his respective statement 00.46 
    hours is stated as the time when he saw the water penetrating.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The psychological 
    expert to the JAIC, Bengt Schager, commented on the Kadak testimony as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»... that Kadak 
      probably saw a water stream, but that he is afraid that this information 
      can be relevant. We have no evidence that he has more information than he 
      has told us and today he might be unwilling to give more information, because 
      he might correctly assume that in such a case he would be partly blamed 
      for the catastrophe ...., the water stream could hardly have been there, 
      rather small or thin, because then it would hardly be visible on a small 
      monitor.« </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The further statement 
    of Hannes Kadak, viz. that Margus Treu had told him:<b><i> "The situation 
    is dangerous or bad, because the ramp was struck and became broken."</i></b> 
    is much more important, but was apparently not questioned by the JAIC.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary 
    it has to be concluded that the JAIC changed the initial statement of Kadak, 
    that he saw - expressed carefully and already under intimidation - <b>a jet 
    of water penetrating the bow ramp,</b> into a "trickle" of water. Of course, 
    a "trickle" would certainly have been difficult to observe on the small monitor, 
    so what Kadak must have seen was much more, viz. almost the same picture that 
    all three of them saw subsequently and of which Sillaste made two drawings. 
    The reason why Kadak did not react differently was most likely because he 
    was on his first watch ever on ESTONIA and simply did not know any better.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the statements 
    made by Treu and Sillaste in 1996 and subsequently - as is now known - that 
    all three - Treu, Kadak and Sillaste - had left the engine control room much 
    earlier, i.e. Kadak and Sillaste when the heel was 30°-35° and Treu when the 
    heel was 40°-45°. It also explains how 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür saw Kadak 
    on the open deck 7 as he left his cabin on the forward port side of deck 7 
    through the window. Since Sillaste and Kadak were together with Silver Linde 
    in the same liferaft, which they all boarded in the forward part below the 
    bridge and Linde has testified that he was in the liferaft already a<b>t 01.23 
    hours</b>, it has to be assumed that they were out on the open deck 7 at a 
    rather early stage, earlier than many crew members from cabins on decks 7 
    and 8, not to speak of the passengers from the lower decks! </font></p>

    Further Evidence </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This and the following pages 
    were left empty for possible new evidence and are thus used for additional 
    testimony received from survivors during the November 1999 hearings and which 
    shall be quoted as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Carl-Erik Reintamm - cabin 
    1094 - 1st deck: </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- He couldn't sleep well 
    and suddenly he heard a sound like the vessel was proceeding through ice, 
    it was "a scraping noise", after he had realised that it couldn't be ice during 
    that time of the year, he finally thought that the vessel ran over something, 
    ca. half a minute later the vessel heeled to starboard.<br>
    - he ran out into the alleyway, but he didn't look at his watch, in the alleyway 
    he saw water in the angle between the wall and the floor streaming along the 
    wall with considerable speed, <br>
    - it was a considerable quantity of water, about 40 centimetres high, which 
    was not running down the stairs from the above car deck, but was rushing very 
    quickly through the centre alleyway in the angle between wall and floor, which 
    made him run even faster into the stairway and up; <br>
    - he did not note any water coming through the car deck doors but heard an 
    alarm signal which sounded like an old fashioned alarm clock which was ringing 
    all the time without interruption, <br>
    - when he came up to Deck 7 he saw two officers from the crew wearing white 
    shirts with epaulettes, but he doesn't recall the number of stripes, at least 
    one of them had a walkie-talkie in his hand, <br>
    - he informed them that the vessel was taking water into deck 1, where upon 
    one officer instructed the other one to go down and check the situation when 
    quite suddenly the ship heeled over again; and the two officers fell to the 
    deck, where after both got back on their feet and went down, probably to investigate; 
    <br>
    - he went out on deck through the left door on Deck 7 (that was the door on 
    the part which was down) and saw two ferries far away from the "Estonia"; 
    <br>
    - the lamps went off and on and the vessel heeled more and more,<br>
    - probably when he tried o release a life boat, he saw a huge thing floating 
    along the vessel, but he cannot exactly say when he saw it, the thing looked 
    square and at first he thought that is was a part of the vessel the waves 
    were washing over it and it was then on one level with the sea surface, he 
    says it was so "quite some time" and others should have also seen it,<br>
    - in the official protocol he was wrongly quoted since it was stated there 
    that he had seen "many items", but he underlines that it was only one item, 
    several metres long each side, like a steel plate it was white and/or light 
    and it was big and still very close and that moment he thought that this item 
    was "the reason for everything", <br>
    - it floated away with small waves coming over it and then it disappeared.</font></p>

    Pub - 5th deck, starboard aft :</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - when he was on the port 
    side of the hull and looked forward, he saw something looking like a stabiliser 
    fin, it was a least 5 metres long and standing completely in the air, but 
    it could not have been a stabiliser fin which was much further aft, the object 
    moved transverse and it was 50 % higher than wide <br>
    - he was sitting above the stabiliser fin, but the thing he saw was far forward 
    of the vessel<br>
    - he was subsequently washed into the water by a wave, and when he finally 
    had time to look from in the water, he saw that the visor was no more there. 
    <br>
    Note: The "thing" Pierre Thiger saw far forward must have been the port aft 
    part of the visor bulwark sticking up and extending the port hull side of 
    the ferry. See page 1091.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Ca. 23.45 hours 
    (Swedish time) = 00.45 hours ship's time a dull bang and ca. 1/2 minute later 
    a similar bang were heard, these were really sharp and short sounds which 
    were clearly heard despite the music, the vessel was shaking somewhat, the 
    noises were not created by waves striking against the bow; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) after a while 
    there was an enormous crash and the whole vessel was shaking / vibrating; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) 23.45/50 hours

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) got lost and 
    ended up on the 2nd car deck, where a CRASH was heard (probably the same as 
    under (2); </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) time before the 
    vessel fell on the side it was felt that the vessel's whole construction was 
    suddenly shaking (probably the same as under (2); </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) unusual shaking/vibrating 
    of the vessel's hull were felt, these shocks were really shaking the vessel 
    and the truck drivers felt uneasy wondering whether the trucks were really 
    secured.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    above item a.) it has to be concluded that the survivors from the 4th deck 
    heard and felt at about 00.45 hours a dull bang and 30 seconds later another 
    similar dull bang. These were sharp and short sounds. A moment later there 
    was an enormous crash and the vessel's structure was shaking/ vibrating. Again 
    a little later there were 3 metallic bangs after which the vessel was shaking/vibrating 
    differently than before. </font></p>

    speed might have been reduced;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) a little later 
    a deep/slow pitch movement and vibrations in the aftship like from astern-pitch 
    and/or stern turned into the wind were realised - glasses were clinking;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) shortly before 
    the list started the vessel began to roll equally in the waves from side to 
    side and it felt as if the vessel did not have the sea from ahead. At that 
    time the engines were not felt;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) there was uncertainty

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the 
    above item b.) it has to be concluded that at some short time after the noise 
    scenario summarised under item a.) the engines/pitch were reduced and/or put 
    to 0 and/or to astern. It has further to be concluded that the course was 
    changed to port or to starboard to the effect that wind/waves came either 
    from port or starboard and caused the vessel to roll.</font></p>

    many explained as "movements" on the car deck could also have been the scraping

    and rolling and then only rolling - 2 full swings, i.e. less to port/more 
    to starboard; at the 3rd swing the vessel heeled deep to starboard, righted 
    almost and then fell abruptly to ca. 15°, this was just before 01.00 hours;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) other survivors 
    identified the bangs to be more like 3 scraping noises which followed one 
    straight after the other with some seconds in between and after these scraping 
    noises the vessel took the severe heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) the heel caused

    has to be considered the exact time of the big heel; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) in a starboard

    the big heel;</font></p>

    reported that 3 "bangs" were heard one after the other; between the first

      between, metal to metal and thought it was a collision, the ship was shaking 
      and vibrating differently than before, shortly afterwards he noted that 
      she was pitching more, but made much slower and deeper movements, there 
      were no more bangs but suddenly he felt vibrations in the aft ship which 
      made him think that they had turned the stern into the sea and the pitch 
      was on astern, he could not see anything out of the window, he felt the 
      vibrations from the propeller (glasses were clinking) and then he heard 
      the strange noise: A very low noise and simultaneously the pitch movements 
      stopped as if a wave had struck under the stern, then all vibrations stopped 
      and in the same second she continued to pitch again, however, without any 
      engine noise, for about one minute she was only pitching, then pitching 
      and rolling, and then only rolling - she made two full swings - more to 
      starboard, less to port, and the third time she heeled over deep to starboard, 
      did not right up again and then fell abruptly to about 40°/45°, this was 
      just before midnight (Swedish time), she came back to almost upright position

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The conference

    side aft.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He had to give 
    a speech and simultaneously show 7-8 overheads. At some time, when he was 
    still showing overheads, a high whining noise started which apparently came 
    somewhere from below. It was loud but constant at the beginning and he just 
    had to speak in a louder voice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He thinks that 
    they had another break after his presentation when the conference hostess 
    was asked to have the machine or pump, creating the disturbing noises, turned 
    off, however, she came back stating that nothing could be done about it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The noise changed 
    to on/off, which was even more disturbing and we closed down the conference 
    about 15-20 minutes earlier than planned, i.e. at 20.40/20.45 hours ST. This 
    means that the noise did presumably start at about 20.30 hours ST.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner at restaurant 
    "SEASIDE" on deck 6, starboard side, was ordered for 21.00 hours ST, but they 
    had to wait some 5-10 minutes before their tables were ready.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner took probably 
    11/2 hours and the time was then about 22.30/22.40 hours ST. He still heard 
    the "noise" in the distance. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having walked 
    around for some time he met four ladies of his group and they went up to deck 
    7, port side where the door to the outside was slamming open/closed and the 
    carpet was soaking wet up to the stairs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thereafter they 
    decided to visit the Admiral's Pub which they entered probably 23.40/23.45 
    hours ST. Also here he heard the "noise".</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Shortly afterwards 
    Sörman felt the change in the vessel's movements because she was now pitching 
    softly and started to roll more. It was much more comfortable then the very 
    hard pitching before and he hoped it would remain like this for the rest of 
    the night.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a while near 
    the stage he walked to a sofa in the starboard forward corner. It was then 
    that he felt 2-3 shocks in his feet. These were like blows in the forward/aft 
    direction, somehow like pitching, but different.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The girls sat on 
    the sofa and he sat on a chair and they continued their discussion when Anita 
    suddenly rose saying she would go to her cabin now. They tried in vain to 
    persuade her to stay and Sörman looked at his watch. It was 23.55 hours ST.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They continued 
    to discuss a particular course when suddenly the vessel heeled very slowly, 
    but much deeper to starboard. She heeled so far over that they could see water 
    splashing against the windows next to them. Behind the bar all the glasses 
    hanging underneath the ceiling fell on top of the bar lady.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel came 
    back to more or less upright condition, maybe even a bit to port, but subsequently 
    heeled again and even deeper to starboard. This time all the tables, chairs 
    and whatever else was not solidly fixed rushed to the starboard side.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The saw again water 
    on the window but the vessel came back again to almost upright condition and 
    they took the chance and rushed to the exit which they managed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was then that 
    he realised that there were no more engine noises, but the lights were on. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel heeled 
    again to starboard, now stepwise with stable periods in between. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They rushed up 
    to deck 6 and further to deck 7 where they reached the aft door and managed 
    to get out to the open deck with difficulties.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They could still 
    walk on the deck, the heel was then probably 30°. </font></li>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Only in the forward 
    third of this deck there were passenger cabins, the luxury cabins equipped 
    with mobile phones. In the larger part, there were the A-la-carte Restaurants 
    SeaSide and Poseidon, the Baltic Bar and the Casino. Also this area had been 
    changed considerably in comparison to the newbuilding layout. The above drawing 
    shows the latest condition. Before referring to the testimony of passengers 
    and crew members having been on this deck, the summary of the statement of 
    Mats Hillerström shall be outlined. He was actually sharing cabin 1026 below 
    car deck with 3 others but felt unwell and scared and thus moved up to the 
    aft and open part of deck 6 already after midnight, ship's time, ca. 00.30 
    hours! See also Chapter 20. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">With reference to 
    the photo on the next page here are his observations in short:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»He 
      stayed in a sheltered place on starboard side best protected against the 
      storm and heard nothing but the noises of the storm. The air was full of 
      spray. At some time he saw a large vessel on starboard side apparently on 
      same course and speed. Also on starboard side, but far away and astern, 
      there was another vessel which was slower because the distance appeared 
      to increase. He looked at his watch and it was 01.05 hours. Suddenly and 
      without any previous indication the vessel heeled to starboard. He saw the 
      tables and chairs inside the restaurant moving to starboard. Within a very 
      short time the vessel took such a list that he could not walk anymore on 
      the deck, but had to pull himself along the railing on the aft part to the 
      higher port side.</i></font></p>

      when the big heel occurred. He saw the vessel still turning to port when 
      he looked over the port side which was confirmed by Christer Ecklöf when 
      he reached the outside of deck 7 only two or three minutes after the heel. 
      It was not confirmed by Per-Erik Ehrnsten who reached the open deck 7 probably 
      four to five minute after the heel.</font></p>

      the big heel was about 01.00 hours as confirmed by most of the survivors 
      who have stated this time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(d) As on the other 
      decks the righting up after the big heel has been reported by only few survivors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (e) Vessel was

<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The time and noise 
    scenarios are basically in agreement with the observations from the other 
    decks, although it has to be borne in mind that only the crew members were 
    accommodated on deck 7 and their statements have to be considered with particular 
    care.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This refers also 
    to the statement of 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür who has testified in his second 
    statement taken on 29.09.94 by the criminal police Tallinn - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/7.3.2.128.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    7.3.2.128</a> - that he met the 1st engineer Arvo Tulvik (() in front of his 
    cabin door, who then said: "Apparently the visor broke up, would be good if 
    the vessel would be taken ashore." In his first statement taken by the Finnish 
    police on 28 September 1994, while he was still on board the ISABELLA (the 
    ferry that rescued him), he specifically said that he had not discussed anything 
    with Arvo Tulvik. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The observations 
    of Elmar Siegel that the man overboard boat (lifeboat No. 1) proceeded away 
    from the vessel without caring for the people in the water and which is confirmed 
    by the surviving passenger Thure Palmgren is of considerable importance, although 
    the consequences cannot be overlooked.</font></li>

    of the survivor Christer Eklöf are quoted. The statement was taken early December 
    1999 by the Finnish lawyer of Meyer Werft, Henrik Gahmberg, but the translated 
    version was only available in March 2000. <br>
    Only those parts of the statement are quoted which have not been covered already: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- when he was crawling along 
    the vessel's hull he saw something like a stick coming out of the hull below 
    the fender bar, <br>
    - he first thought it would be the stabiliser fin and he wanted to hold on 
    to that thing, however <br>
    - it was too far in the fore part of the vessel and too small to be the stabiliser 
    fin, <br>
    - the "thing" was about 1 to 1.5 metres long and only 10 or 20 centimetres 
    thick,<br>
    - it had the same colour as the bottom,<br>
    - it was not a bilge keel, <br>
    - he does not believe that it was a damaged propeller blade of the bow thruster 
    because those do not have the colour of the bottom, <br>
    - when he was underneath the bridge, he heard a muffled sound from there and 
    compares it with an imploding TV-set, <br>
    - when he was down in the sea he saw that the visor was missing,<br>
    - the police did not show any interest in the fact that he had seen this thing 
    when they were interrogating him. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Per-Erik Ehrnsten - interviewed 
    by Peter Jansson on 1 May 2000 : </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- ESTONIA left somewhat delayed 
    at about 19.15/20 hours. At 19.00 hours vehicles were still boarding, he could 
    hear the sounds.<br>
    - Vessel started pitching noticeably after 21.00 hours and at about 23.00 
    hours he went to his cabin 6304 on deck 6 which was an inside cabin without 
    windows, the bed was athwartships. <br>
    - He cannot recall significant rolling, just pitching, <br>
    - he woke up several times by vibrations in the hull when the bow was diving 
    into the waves, <br>
    - at a certain time these vibrations were replaced by new sounds which were 
    regular 4-5 tong, tong sounds, a short pause and the same again, which appeared 
    to be transmitted through the ship's structure as vibrations from somewhere 
    forward and below; the tong, tong sounds came in such short intervals that 
    they could not have been caused by wave movements; there was no change in 
    the ship's movements that he could associate wit the tong, tong sounds.<br>
    - There were 4-5 "tongs", then a pause of 4-5 seconds and then again 4-5 "tongs", 
    the interval between the "tongs" remained the same, ice floes crashing against 
    the hull in the winter cause less heavy sounds than these tongs did;<br>
    - he does not recall having noted change of engine revolutions at that time; 
    <br>
    - there were 2 "tong" sequences before the big heel to starboard occurred. 
    <br>
    - There was first one smaller and then a bigger heel to starboard when he 
    just had his trousers on and everything flew against the door; - he removed 
    these things from the door, went out, turned into the central (forward) stairway, 
    rushed up the stairs to deck 7, where he was helped out on deck by Silver 
    Linde and two other sailors, Silver Linde was talking into his walkie-talkie 
    and refused to follow some order, he was very irritated (P.E. Ehrnsten understands 
    Estonian): <br>
    - The heel was about 30° when he came out on deck and the wind and waves came 
    in from the aft port quarter (30° to 60° from aft of abeam, port side). <br>
    - With his back to the wall (longitudinal bulkhead on deck7) he could see 
    the two ferries 20-30° aft of abeam at port side; at the same time he could 
    see the moon and the bow simultaneously; <br>
    - the ferry stabilised at a heel of 30-50° for quite a while; <br>
    - the waves came from port aft and the ship was drifting with the wind, he 
    and other people were eventually washed overboard by waves approaching from 
    aft and washing oblique about the bottom, ended up in the water on the same 
    side as funnel and bridge were, i.e. in the lee. <br>
    - He saw the stabiliser fin sticking out about below the forward door, it 
    was not moving. <br>
    - When he was washed overboard he was slightly forward of the bridge.<br>
    - From the water he could see the unbroken silhouette of the vessel against 
    the moonlight.</font></p>

    to starboard, while the second one had doors to both sides. Both store lifts 
    had no sills at all and led down to the 1st deck in way of the engine room. 
    At the aft end of the centre casing a container lift of 10' x 8' x 8' was 
    installed which led down to the 1st deck only. The doors opened to the aft

    casing just interrupted in way of the 2 store lifts, i.e. the sills of the 
    sliding doors had a total height of 230 mm. None of the lift doors were watertight. 
    All 4 lifts went up to the 8th deck.</font></p>

    operated hydraulically either from a panel on the bridge or manually on site.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The doors were sliding 
    doors, closing from port to starboard. The hydraulic station for these doors 
    was located about midships in the centre casing on 2nd car deck (B-deck) level. 
    Before and during the closing of the doors yellow flashlights went on.</font></p>

    dark. Note: This is a key statement which gives a great deal of explanation 
    because Carl Övberg could be questioned in detail and because he was very 
    co-operative. There can be no doubt that many of the survivors could give 
    considerably more details if they would have been asked properly by the JAIC. 
    Another unforgivable mistake of the JAIC who had the authority and the means

    to his statement, which can be summarized as follows: - He went to bed at 
    23.00-23.30 hours, noticed heavy movements of the vessel and lots of cracking 
    noises. He also heard that something was frequently heavily beating against 
    the vessel;</font></p>

    the heavy movements of the vessel, heard a scraping noise, i.e. it was cracking 
    and scraping very close to him on the deck above him. This was (for him) the 
    introduction to the developments which ended in the catastrophe;<br>
    - <b>A little later Martin felt that the noises were connected to the shaking 
    of the vessel, and then the vessel began to heel noticeably. He and his bed 
    moved upwards while the others in their beds on the opposite side of the cabin 
    moved downwards. He is unable to explain this in more detail. Simultaneously 
    the strong scraping noise was being continuously heard and then Jan Gustavsson

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of these 
    statements of the survivors from the passenger accommodation on the 1st deck, 
    the following can be concluded:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) 21 passengers 
      from the 1st deck survived. This is a comparatively high number, bearing 
      in mind that from all the six accommodation decks only 137 persons (official 
      number) had survived, because the survivors from deck 1 had by far the longest 
      and most difficult way to deck 7. Presum-ably because they had been warned 
      early through their proximity to the noise scenario, they had therefore 
      left their cabins earlier and faster than many of those from the upper decks 
      had done.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) 9 reported 
      water on the 1st deck, of which two noted the water already <b>before </b>the 
      big heel, but the others only one minute or more thereafter. 4 reported 
      a lot of water up to 0.4 m high which was rushing very quickly respectively 
      under pressure. Thus water has been on the 1st and consequently also on 
      0-deck <b>before </b>the big heel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) 9 reported 
      water on car deck level inside the centre casing and/or penetrating the 
      car deck, of which one saw water directly on the car deck through a partly 
      open car deck door (most aft stairway for passengers). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(d) 14 reported 
      the abrupt wide heel (45°-60°), were thrown out of their beds and/or against 
      the walls etc., but only three reported that the ferry more or less righted 
      up thereafter, although it is absolutely clear that if the ferry had not 
      righted from a heel of 45°-60°, nobody would have been able to escape from 
      the 1st deck or would have been able to reach the outside of deck 7 from 
      any other deck. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) Water was reported 
      from the 1st, the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th compartments. In cabin 1120 located 
      in the first compartment in the centre line, on top of a full freshwater 
      tank the water penetrated the door from the alleyway, i.e. the water height 
      in the alleyway exceeded the height of the door sill. In the 3rd compartment 
      water was noted in the alleyway, probably originating from either the spiral 
      stairway or the lift casing. In the 4th compartment water was seen to escape 
      from 2 ventilation openings under high pressure. In the 5th compartment 
      water was reported to have penetrated the floor. All observations were made 
      either in the longitudinal alleyway in the centre line or in athwartships 
      alleyways at the starboard side only. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) The time for 
      the big heel was stated only by few survivors to have been just after 01.00 
      hours. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(g) <b>The noise 
      scenario:<br>
      </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most 
      of the survivors reported <b>at least one very heavy bang, crash, impact 
      combined with an abrupt stopping of the vessel as if the vessel had collided 
      with something,</b> which was so strong that they were thrown against the 
      walls, etc. Before this very dramatic crash/impact noise, which apparently 
      caused the vessel to stop abruptly and which was clearly before the sharp 
      and wide heels to starboard, there had been other noise scenarios heard 
      by survivors, which were different. While Carl Övberg was in his cabin in 
      the 4th compartment he heard hydraulic and sledge-hammer type banging noises. 
      The others further forward and aft heard howling, squeaking and, most dominantly, 
      scraping noises which were combined with the shaking of the vessel and which 
      sounded as if the vessel proceeded through ice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (n) This noise 
      scenario has been explained in detail to the diving and underwater explosives 
      expert Brian Braidwood, who has excluded, with a high degree of certainty, 
      that any of the noises heard by the survivors could have been caused by 
      explosions. See also Chapter 32. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Silver Linde :</b> 
    He heard and felt only one crash when he was on the car deck, i.e. about 15 
    minutes before the heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Margus Treu :

    and then the heel came.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Henrik Sillaste 
    :</b> He felt three impacts not caused by waves when he was working and then 
    the heel followed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Jaan Stern : </b>Immediately 
    before the heavy heel, what he thought were waves beating very hard against 
    the vessel, then silence and then the vessel fell on the side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Neemi Künno Kalk 
    :</b> Woke up from a loud rushing sound.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Ulla Marianne 
    Tenman :</b> Some time before the casualty heard several hard bangs and something 
    beating against something. Later (when she was up on the 7th deck) she heard 
    a heavy bang and the vessel heeled to starboard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Carl-Erik Reintamm 
    :</b> He suddenly heard two strong, strange noises, some-thing like scraping 
    noises which came from below (like ice scraping along the vessel's bottom), 
    shortly later the vessel fell on the side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Carl Övberg : 
    </b>He woke up suddenly from the strong noise of rushing water which he could 
    hear from both sides, but loudest from starboard side; these noises alarmed 
    him;</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - in addition 
      he heard quite strong metallic banging noises which definitely had not been 
      there before; he sat up in bed and put his feet on the floor, since the 
      bed was athwartships he was facing the door looking aft;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he lit a cigarette 
      and listened attentively to the strange and frightening noise scenario;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after a little 
      while he suddenly heard the starting up noise of an hydraulic pump or pumps 
      followed by the clicking of valves and then the typical noise created by 
      an hydraulic system under load;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - simultaneously 
      he heard the banging of sledge hammers or something like that;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the noises came 
      probably from forward;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the hydraulic 
      under load noise faded away and came back again whilst the sledge-hammer 
      banging noise more or less continued. Both the hydraulic noise and the sledge-hammer 
      banging noise continued for ca. 10-15 minutes whilst the other banging noises, 
      then heard already for some 20-25 minutes, also continued;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the hydraulic 
      noise and the sledge-hammer noise stopped with a short, sharp metallic crash 
      which gave him the impression that something heavy, metallic had broken:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after a 'silence' 
      of 30-40 seconds the next really extreme crash followed in connection with 
      an abrupt stopping of the ferry which was so 'sudden' that he was thrown 
      against the front wall of his bed; it was a short, sharp intense crash as 
      if the ship had struck against something or was struck by something;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he jumped out 
      of his bed and put his clothes on very quickly when he realised that all 
      the engine noises had stopped and that the ferry was now making much softer 
      pitch movements; </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">this 
      must have been at about 01.00 hours, ca. 1-2 minutes later the vessel heeled 
      very wide to starboard.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Martin Nilsson 
    :</b> Something was frequently heavily beating against the vessel; 10-15 minutes 
    before the big heel he heard scraping noises, i.e. cracking and scraping; 
    the strong scraping noise was continuously heard also while the big heel occurred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Jan Gustavsson

    noise.</font></p>

    : </b>At each pitch movement something was beating against the hull<i> "as 
    if somebody was hammering with a big stone".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Jasmina Waidinger 
    :</b> Heard banging noises which were abnormal, then she heard a rushing sound 
    (water), then heard strong noise above her like something big and strong moving 
    from one place to another; next came the heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Bengt Nilsson 
    : </b>Could not sleep because of something frequently beat-ing very heavily 
    against the hull. Later heard roaring squeaking, shrieking and scraping followed 
    by a metallic breaking noise from starboard aft. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Ants Nadar : </b>Woke

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Andrus Maidre

    something like a truck toppling over. </font></p>

    Felt extremely hard bang and was thrown against the cabin wall before he was 
    thrown out of his bed due to the big heel; he was unable to identify from

    and at the same time came the excessive heel. </font></p>

    with the stern area resting aground already and the bow rising high, the highest

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The ESTONIA 
    was equipped with two modern EPIRB buoys (Emergency Position Indicating Radio 
    Beacons) of type Kannad 406 F.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The last check of 
    the radio beacons was reported to have been made about one week prior to the 
    disaster by the radio operator. The check confirmed that the EPIRBs were in 
    full working order and it has to be assumed that both were left in "switched-on" 
    condition after the test.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Nevertheless, no 
    signals from the two buoys were received in the course of the rescue operation.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
    to the above information the vessels were tracked auto-matically (and apparently 
    recorded by radar), although it is stated in the Utö log that "the target 
    had been tracked by Utö radar only from 01.40-01.48 hours" and that "at 01.48 
    hours radar supervisor Eija Viiala lost the target from the screen". In another 
    report put into the INTERNET already on 01.10.94 by Kari Ili-Kuha from Tampere, 
    Finland it is stated: <i>»According to today's papers the ship seems to have 
    been in trouble already over one hour before the distress signal. </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A 
    female radar operator on duty in Utö fort noticed that the ship had gradually 
    gone astray from her normal route, so that by the time of the distress signal 
    the ship was already about 15 km South off the course and the signal was weak. 
    The operator was surprised that the ship had not called for help earlier if 
    they had problems. The ship had obviously had both engine and electrical problems. 
    It remains a mystery why the crew on the bridge delayed the alarm, didn't 
    they realise how serious the situation was? In the aftermath this is just 
    plain useless speculation, but had they acted earlier in giving the alarm 
    both in the ship and over the radio the number of casualties would likely 
    not have been as high as they are now.«</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since "Eija" is 
    a female name in Finland, the radar operator Eija Viiala stated in the Utö 
    log could be identical to the "female radar operator" mentioned in the INTERNET 
    message quoted above, although accor-ding to the Utö log she tracked ESTONIA 
    only from 01.40-01.48 hours, when ESTONIA's stern was probably just settling 
    down on the sea bottom and her bow rose out of the water, thus ESTONIA could 
    not have changed her position very much during these 8 minutes. Two alleged 
    radar plots were received from the Finnish Navy in this respect which are 
    shown below.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Apparently the Navy 
    was more talkative in the early days as obvious from the quoted INTERNET message 
    which is apparently based on a newspaper report. The complete message is attached

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to 
    find out what the Finnish Navy records had on file, a meeting was held with 
    Commander Vesa Ennevaara at the head office of the Finnish Navy in December 
    1998 and the results of the discussions are summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The 1994 radar 
      system was based on the equipment from the 1980s. The software was not as 
      comprehensive as the current one. The main difference was that the 1994 
      system did not record data in permanent memory, which the new system will 
      do when fully implemented. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tracking 
      units, such as radar stations, aeroplanes and ships etc pick up targets 
      and report all new objects to the next level op's centre. The acquisition 
      of targets involves all military arms (navy, air force and army) as well 
      as pilots, coast guard and customs. New targets are assigned a number ID 
      and as soon as identification is possible, either by VHF or visually, the 
      name of the object is determined. The new system will operate the identification 
      process also by radar transponder codes, combined with the old system.<br>
      Tracking was done by one radar station at a time - feeding data to the OP's 
      centre - until the target was formally "handed over" to the next tracking 
      station. At the same time an object could be visible and followed on the 
      screens of other tracking stations, as well, but they would not feed data 
      into the system.<br>
      Tracking details were stored and transmitted in bursts from radar stations 
      to the OP's centres. The data was stored in buffer memories. Overflow of 
      data in a buffer memory would automatically cause deletion of the oldest 
      data. Depending on the amount of data on each separate object this could 
      mean anything from hours to maybe a full day or more of data remained in 
      each buffer. The buffer for Estonia (if the ship was within range and was 
      tracked at all, which according to Ennevaara is unclear) probably would 
      have contained data all the way from Tallinn/Nayssaar, but no one thought 
      to ask for it imme-diately after the accident. All old data was lost due 
      to the lack of memory storage space and unavailability of such a software 
      facility in 1994, because when the and rescue operation commenced much older 
      information was quickly lost from the buffers since intense tracking at 
      short time differentials will rapidly fill a buffer.<br>
      The area of interest to the Navy Command charged with synchronising the 
      rescue efforts was narrow, comprising the area between Utö and Hangö only. 
      According to Commander Ennevaara no one thought about saving historical 
      tracking data from other areas in time.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is obviously wrong as far as the ESTONIA is concerned, because the plot received 
    and which is titled "40H 28/09/94 ESTONIA" was sent by fax on the day of the 
    casualty - 28.09.94 - at 16.45 hours to the Navy's head office, thus then 
    the stored data must still have been available as also confirmed by the also 
    received list of times/positions/ bearings which reportedly refer to the radar 
    station Örö (between Russarö [Hangö] and Utö). While the times and positions 
    are mostly reflected by the plot, the bearing/speed items do not make sense 
    and are - according to the Navy - based on the Coast Artilleries' own system 
    which they could not explain.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Any ship could 
      enter Finnish territorial waters at night, without being properly identified, 
      and leave again - unless the manoeuvre was interesting enough to cause an 
      investigation. After such a visitor had left, the buffer memory would be 
      used again when needed and such historical data would be lost. Coast guard 
      stations, responsible for shipping security, would sometimes call such targets 
      (ships) to advise them if they were heading towards danger. In case there 
      was reply a positive ID would have been established - otherwise none at 
      all. This could be the case irrespective of whether a target was a "red" 
      object, unless this was known in advance and the target duly picked up and 
      identified by plane or surface ship.«</i></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Coast guard 
      radars are not operated by dedicated and trained personnel on uninterrupted 
      duty - like the Navy and Air Force radar stations are. Even when tracking, 
      the operator may leave the radar set for coffee or lunch or even for watch 
      duty, without a replacement at the screen. Coast guard, pilot and customs 
      radars are commercial equipment, without the refined electronics of military 
      equipment. Range and resolving power, as well as tracking accuracy are therefore 
      inferior. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      most reliable plotting is always obtained by hand. Plots obtained from stored 
      data is always less reliable and contains spurious data. This is due to 
      the fact that stored data contains past, present and predicted data. The 
      predicted data may be incorrect and will be corrected on the next sweep 
      or data transfer sequence. Even a stationary target will thus from time 
      to time show a vector although it does not move at all. <br>
      The Navy's Estonia track was obtained from stored "buffer data" and is therefore 
      not entirely reliable, besides not having an absolutely reliable identification 
      (name of the ship). Nevertheless, according to Commander Ennevaara the Navy 
      is about 90% sure that it was the Estonia. The plot in question is layed 
      into chapter 22.<br>
      If it was not the Estonia, it would be an unidentified vessel. The radar 
      weather was said to have been very bad and the radio communications were 
      frequently interrupted according to the Utö radar station notes.«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 
    any event, the radar observer Eija Viiala saw a radar target which she believed 
    to have been the ESTONIA from the time she took over from Örö radar station 
    apparently at 00.33 hours. Apparently she told the local newspaper shortly 
    after the casualty what she had seen for more than 1 hour before the 'Mayday' 
    at 01.22 hours, which makes it even more difficult to understand why the respective 
    data should not have been secured although the respective data of all the 
    other vessels were secured.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Commander Ennevaara

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»the radar range 
      was only barely sufficient to pick up the site of the accident due to the 
      distance and the very bad radar weather. The track, designated Estonia by 
      the Navy, was named Estonia without any optical or secure identification 
      of the target. The identity has been checked backward from the known location 
      of the wreck by the Navy - but may have been an entirely different ship 
      as well.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Ennevaara offered 
    that the radar operators may be interviewed and that the station logs be searched 
    which, to his knowledge, has never been done so far.</font></p>

    time reasons it has also not been done by this 'Group of Experts".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In reply to a respective 
    question Commander Ennevaara said that</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »the Finnish Intelligence 
      service in 1994 did not listen with the objective of locating the transmissions 
      but in order to <i>pick up contents of messages. Interesting messages would 
      be transmitted to op's centres without confidentiality. (This of course 
      must depend on the contents of the intercepted message, although Commander 
      Ennevaara did not say so.)«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In a subsequent 
    telephone interview the watch officer of SILJA EUROPA, Teijo Seppelin (the 
    MARIELLA witnesses could not be reached), stated the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»- as far as 
      he could see, the Estonia was never in front of SILJA EUROPA - but came 
      up from the south-east. This track would be different from the Navy radar 
      track designated Estonia - and would be similar to the one put forward by 
      the JAIC. Seppelin said that the Estonia normally came up straight from 
      the south-east, i.e. from what must have been the Estonia/Nayssaar sound 
      and crossed the track of the SILJA EUROPA. One crew of the Estonia would 
      arrogantly cross the SILJA EUROPA track close under the bow and force the 
      Officer to pull back on the engines, while the other crew would always pass 
      politely under the stern. This was in the summer when the SILJA EUROPA entered 
      at Sandhamn and the Estonia at Söderarm.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      he does not believe that the Navy track is that of the Estonia. Neither 
      does the officer (Capt. Ltn. Niemelä from Utö), who was in charge of the 
      radar station, primarily because the Navy track follows the normal routing 
      system, initially west then, west-south-west. <br>
      - he does not recall radio interruptions but remembers that the MARIELLA's 
      inability to reach Helsinki Radio on VHF Ch 16 and MF 2182 was widely discussed 
      afterwards. He recalls the Mayday signals were of distinctly different character, 
      one very weak and the other quite normal in strength.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for the 
    Finnish Navy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> While searching 
    through the files of the public prosecutor in Stockholm a copy was found referring 
    to a drawing belonging to an article which had appeared in the Estonian newspaper 
    ILTA-SANOMAT on 01.10.1994. It shows the deviation of ESTONIA to the South 
    of the normal route (see interview above of the Utö radar observer in the 
    INTERNET message - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.3.385.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    22.3.385</a>) and the apparent existence of another vessel in the vicinity 
    of the casualty position, viz. the BALANGA QUEEN which had allegedly passed 
    "very close" to the casualty position. On the above-mentioned copy it is handwritten 
    in Swedish:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»If the BALANGA 
      QUEEN had not been ahead of schedule and if ESTONIA had called for help 
      when her problems actually started, then hundreds of lives could have been 
      saved.«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Why ESTONIA's 
      emergency messages or other radio communica-tions were delayed and did not 
      reach BALANGA QUEEN is still unclear.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The (available) 
    files of the prosecutor do not contain any more documentation in regard to 
    BALANGA QUEEN nor do the (available) files of the Swedish and Finnish parts 
    of the JAIC. The logbook page 2 is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.3.386.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently 
    another INTERNET search was performed and under the date 29.09.94 the following 
    was found:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      opinion of Estonian seamen is much higher. The papers quote surviving truck 
      drivers who had asked why their trucks were not chained to their places,

      was an Estonian passenger ship, Balanga something, that was only 30 sea 
      miles south of "Estonia" but didn't pick up the emergency signal while four 
      Finnish ones did and went to help.«</i></font></p>

      Wednesday night, an hour after "Estonia" had sunk, the coast guards of Jussar 
      Lighthouse noticed a ship sailing off course towards underwater rocks. They 
      tried to alert the crew with searchlights and radio messages in Finnish, 
      Swedish and English. No response. The ship passed the lighthouse, averted 
      the first rocks by sheer luck, then turned sharply to south and safety. 
      After radio contact was established the captain of the "Leonid Bykov" explained 
      that the fresh First Officer keeping watch didn't know any English, but 
      when the radio messages continued, he figured out that maybe he needed to 
      wake up the captain (who had made the safety move).<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above is the 
    only comment made by a member of the JAIC to the effect that the casualty 
    might have been caused by "not properly" or even "opened" doors. <br>
    Thereby it is unclear whether the visor - also called 'bow door' or the 'bow 
    ramp', sometimes also called 'door' or 'gate' - is meant.<br>
    It is also interesting that the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, told the 
    press that he had been informed about the catastrophe already at about 03.00 
    hours, while the Finnish Government, first of all the Prime Minister, was 
    informed only at 04.55 hours and the other Government members thereafter until 
    about 05.40 hours. At that time the chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, 
    Kari Lethola, was already on his way to Turku. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand, MRCC Helsinki did inform MRCC Tallinn at 02.55 hours, but <i>"not in 
    detail, only that something had happened and that people were in distress",</i> 
    whilst subsequently - at 10.05 hours - the Finnish Minister of the Interior 
    Pekkavinen told the press that <i>"the Estonian Authorities were informed 
    at 02.00 hours by the Finnish Authorities".<br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently 
    there were "other authorities" also involved in the casualty which had nothing 
    to do with the rescue services and which must have been informed already that 
    ESTONIA was in trouble while the vessel was still afloat.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It also has 
    to be assumed with certainty that there had been intense communication between 
    the ESTONIA and Tallinn, at least during the last hour, and that ESCO knew 
    what was going on onboard the ESTONIA much before the first, weak 'Mayday' 
    was received by MARIELLA. Officially 137 persons survived the catastrophe, 
    93 bodies were brought ashore and identified, and 759 persons are officially 
    missing. These figures do not include the Iraqis in the trailer on the car 
    deck, the unregistered Pakistanis and the also unregistered relatives of crew 
    members also said to have been on board. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>25.4 <br>
    Further Evidence </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">According to the JAIC Report, 
    Chapter 8.2, the first ROV inspection from the wreck was carried out from 
    the "HALLI" on 2 October 1994. The respective logbook pages have recently 
    been received, although the name "HALLI" is nowhere written on the available 
    pages. According to the logbook entries Tuomo Karppinen and Siimo Aarnio, 
    member and expert of the Finnish JAIC were onboard besides Turunen, Louhivuori 
    and Tenhunen who are unknown. Video recordings by ROV were performed between 
    12.17 hours - 20.45 hours. The three tapes received from the Finnish JAIC 
    in March 1995 do fall into this time frame, however, substantial parts were 
    cut out in a rather unprofessional way. <br>
    Note: During a recent telephone conversation between Tuomo Karppinen and the 
    Swedish journalist Knut Carlqvist <br>
    Karppinen revealed that they had made certain cuts already onboard of "HALLI". 
    <br>
    Further according to the logbook the first anchor position 59°22,91'N; 21°40,93'E 
    was very close to the wreck, where video recordings took place between 12.17 
    hours and about 16.30 hours. At 16.40 hours the vessel shifted position to 
    59°22,54'N; 21°40,51'E where the anchor was dropped at 17.00 hours and video 
    recording started again at 17.15 hours and stopped at 20.45 hours. This second 
    position was about half way between the Mayday position 59°22,0'N; 21°40'E 
    and the wreck position. This second "HALLI" position was in direction 207°, 
    0.45 nm distant from the wreck. <br>
    This means that the video footage provided should show after 17.00 hours only 
    pictures from the seabed because the longest ROV umbilical is 400 m long while 
    the wreck is 0.45 nm = 830 m away. It would also make no sense to lift anchor 
    from a position next to the wreck and move almost 1/2 mile away and then send 
    the ROV back all the way. <br>
    Since, however, all three videos submitted by the Finnish JAIC to be raw material 
    show numerous sequences with parts of the wreck well after 17.00 hours it 
    has to be concluded that these videos were not only manipulated by or on behalf 
    of the Finnish JAIC by cutting out vital parts of evidence, but also by changing 
    the times. The reason for this time manipulation is obvious: It was the intention 
    to create the impression that the many interesting objects on the bottom of 
    the sea were lying relatively close to the wreck because the ROV moves away 
    from the stern and views the objects only 2 or 3 minutes later. Actually the 
    ROV did start from a position 0.45 nm = 830 m to the SSW of the wreck and 
    then proceeded another 250-300 mm to the W or SW, i.e. 1100-1200 m to the 
    SSW of the wreck these objects were found, e.g. the ramp rail, the stabiliser 
    fin, parts from the car deck and other objects which the public was prevented 
    from seeing by tape cuts. <br>
    This leads to the following conclusions:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) The vessel drifted from 
    SSW to NNE. <br>
    (b) The vessel was very severely heeled or already upside down in a position 
    about 1000 m to the SSW of the wreck.<br>
    (c) Since the ROV found objects were about on the connection line between 
    Mayday position and wreck position, slightly closer to the Mayday position, 
    and the engines had stopped about 10 minutes before the Mayday already, it 
    has to be assumed that the vessel was initially even further to the South, 
    probably 0.5 nm to the SW of the Mayday position at about 01.10/12 hours. 
    According to the 3rd engineer the final speed was 6 kn, i.e. going further 
    back 10 minutes at 6 kn to 01.02 hours when the big heel occurred and the 
    vessel was reportedly turning to port, that is to say 1 nm, the vessel was 
    at 01.02 hours at the approximate position 59°21,6'N; 21°37,8'N, which is 
    not unrealistic. From this position the alleged visor position lies about 
    30°, 1.2-1.3 nm distant and it is more than doubtful that ESTONIA had ever 
    been up that far in the North.<br>
    (d) It has to be concluded that the plot of ESTONIA's track in the JAIC Report 
    on page 173 is completely wrong. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Also from the vessel "TURSAS", 
    used for the ROV inspections on 9/10 October 1994, the logbook page for 9 
    October was recently made available and has meanwhile been translated. It 
    reveals that according to the logbook entry on 9 October at 10.20 hours three 
    JAIC representatives: Saarikko, Tenhunen and Louhivuori boarded the vessel 
    and ROV equipment was also taken onboard. Tenhunen and Louhivouri had already 
    taken part in the ROV inspection on 2 October. <br>
    At 17.30 hours anchor was dropped in position 59°22,93'N; 21°40,73'E which 
    was near the stern of the wreck. At 21.10 hours the anchor was lifted and 
    dropped again 200 m to the NE at 21.25 hours, i.e. to port of the bow of the 
    wreck. Video recording is not mentioned in the log, but the available video 
    covers the time between 21.55 and 02.15 hours on the following day, 10 October

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> The logbook from the search 
    vessel "TURSAS" from 16, 17, 18 October 1994 are available and have been translated. 
    Accordingly the vessel was in Latokori on 16th and 17th October, where at 
    09.20 hours the following persons boarded the vessel: Saarikko, Louhivuori, 
    Turunen, Nuorteva, Ratia and Kujansuu. Louhivuori and Turunen were already 
    participating in the previous ROV inspections and Nuorteva is a sonar expert 
    from the Finnish Navy, according to the newspaper reports - see Chapter 37.2 
    - and he is also mentioned in the fax reports from Kari Lethola to Olof Forssberg 
    - see Chapter 24. The "TURSAS" left her berth and shortly afterwards moored 
    alongside the CG vessel "UISKO". From this vessel the Swedish Captain Commander 
    Tönnström came onboard and the Finnish Captain Lieutenant Mikkilä left the 
    vessel, which subsequently sailed. At 21.30 hours in position 59°25,45'N; 
    21°43,55'E the search by means of sidescan sonar was commenced. This position 
    lies 3 nm to the NE of the wreck where in all probability ESTONIA can never 
    have been, thus it has to be assumed that the gentlemen were searching for 
    something different than the visor of the ESTONIA. The search was subsequently 
    carried from ca. 1 nm to the East of the wreck, to ca. 2 nm to the South and 
    1 nm to the West of the wreck, which according to Kari Lethola's fax to Olof 
    Forssberg on 06.10.94 - see page 702 - had already been searched before. Anyway, 
    according to the "TURSAS" log entries the visor was found and identified by 
    ROV on 18.10.94 at 15.30 hours in position x = 6585650, y = 1587250 which, 
    according to the F.B.N. computer corresponds to 59°22,526'N; 21°39,322'E which 
    was subsequently repeated by the Finnish Navy to be 59°22,97'N; 21°39,33'E. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">According to the logbook 
    entry (manual) of icebreaker "NORDICA" the visor was found in position 59°23'N; 
    21°39,4'E, lifted and brought to Hankö. See Enclosure 24.408.1. There is presently 
    no more evidence on the visor search and position available. </font></p>

    supposed to enter the car deck, the divers inspecting the bow ramp and their 
    supervisor. The identities of the persons involved is unknown and they are

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It follows a conversation

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> D: He'll have to go in down 
    the bottom now, he'll not fit in at the top.</font></p>

    I can't hear you.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> D: He'll have to go in down 
    stairs because he can't go in at the top. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: He'll have to go down 
    the stairs, he can't get in at the top. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Go straight down from 
    where he is.</font></p>

    gone in actually. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The above implies that the 
    diver knew a way from the starboard outside into the car deck which could 
    only have been the big hole in the forepart of the car deck extending down 
    into the tank spaces and probably bow thruster space of the 1st deck. See

    the broken parts of the visor hinge plates and the aft end of the visor arm 
    lower closing plate. - See the drawing below. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition images 
    2 and 4 show an area of burnt deck paint to starboard of the outer lug plate, 
    i.e. below the location of the bushing in normal condition. This indicates 
    that flame cutting had been carried out that close to the deck that the paint 
    became burnt.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Images 5 and 
    6 show the middle and outer part of the hinge bolt (3). The bolt moved out 
    of the hinges due to the list of the wreck and is ever since standing on the 
    adjacent railbar. There are three areas of green paint visible which are indicated 
    by red dots. Since only the deck was painted green it has to be assumed that 
    the green paint visible on the bolt was deck paint. The hinge arrangement 
    was a closed system without gaps between bushings and lug plates. This was 
    evidently no more the case when the green deck paint was able to reach the 
    bolt at least in three places! The explanation that this was possible can 
    also be found in Subchapter 12.5 and on the enlarged images attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.5.181</a>/<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.1.htm" target="_blank">12.5.181.1</a>, 
    i.e. the starboard visor hinge arrangement was totally misaligned with the 
    outer bushing sticking out too much which created the gaps between hinge plates/bushings 
    enabling the green paint to reach the bolt. The condition of the outer part 
    of the outer bushings of which the lower part was evidently cut off explains 
    the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The bolt had 
      only to some extent engaged the outer visor hinge plate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The burnt 
      off lower part of the bushing made it possible for the bushing to fall off 
      the bolt (contrary to the port where the bushing was intact and consequently 
      remained attached to the bolt - see the following item P 1).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) During the 
      flame cutting (burning) of the lower part of the said bushing the deck paint 
      below the bushing was burnt because of the narrow distance between the lower 
      part of the bushing and the green deck.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Image 4 shows also 
    scoring marks on the deck in front of the hinge plates evidently caused by 
    the visor arm lower closing plate during opening/closing of the visor. This 
    indicates that the visor was too low in the hinges, a consequence of the burnt

    assumed that the bolt had been extended when the ramp was closed some time 
    before the casualty and the top plate and the adjacent longitudinal plate

    the bolts (when the vessel was in upright condition).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> No. 1.2.4 - The<b>

    the longitudinal part of the recess of the front bulkhead directly above the 
    opening with the ramp actuator fastening (when the ramp was in closed condition). 
    This box is visible on the videos made on 02.10.99 only as a shadow but apparently 
    it was there already. The reason for this difficulty is the much smaller gap 
    between bulkhead and bow ramp at that time. The box will be explained further 
    in Chapter 32.</font></p>

    gap increase between 02. and 09.10.94, but also more Teco lines (floatable 
    mooring lines) were rising up between ramp and bulkhead. One of them appears 
    to be turned around the box which must have been manmade. This is surprising 
    because at that time "officially" no divers had been down to the wreck. <br>
    The next available images are made from the<b> ROV and diver videos of 01.

    Close ups made from the diver videos of the one hawser left proved it to be 
    jammed in between the extended landing for the actuator fastenings and the 
    bulkhead - see the image below. To the left is the ramp landing and to the 
    right the bulkhead. It is obvious that such jamming can only occur when the 
    ramp was moved open/closed which must have been the case between<b> 09.10.94

    normal condition). The actuator with the broken lug of the piston rod (bright 
    spot) is visible and - behind the actuator - in almost upright condition some 
    object which upon a very detailed video evaluation turned out to be an angle 
    iron. The two dark areas in the white paint of the bulkhead proved to be two 
    deep indentations obviously caused by the angle iron under pressure.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before 
    in Chapter 27 it has to be assumed that the crew fitted the angle iron in 
    place to support the closing operation, i.e. to ensure smooth closing of the 
    port side of the ramp which was detached from the vessel due to the broken 
    hinges and which was considerably pressed down during opening and closing 
    of the ramp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The starboard 
    actuator</b> area looks totally different compared to the port one because 
    there is very heavy damage, the probable cause of which shall be explained 
    in Chapter 32. Among other things also the fastening of the starboard actuator 
    to the bow ramp was affected. All available images from this part of the ramp 
    are made from the ROV video of 09.10.94, thus show the ramp pressed against 
    the starboard longitudinal bulkhead part of the recess. For orientation purposes 
    the first image below shows the transverse girder at the bottom in the middle 
    which runs up diagonally to the left where a large crack is visible. The strong 
    girder running from left middle to right up is the starboard outside longitudinal 
    girder. At the port side of the mentioned transverse the landing for the fastenings 
    of the port actuator were fitted, at its starboard side the fastenings for 
    the starboard actuator were fitted.</font></p>

    a close-up looking slightly more from below (in normal condition) which clearly 
    shows the full extent of damage to the burst open landing. The landing was 
    pushed upwards and the steel structure burst open. Behind the two triangle-shaped 
    brackets below the damage the broken piston rod is visibly jammed in (see 
    arrow). It broke in the lug at the bottom end of the piston rod approximately 
    in the same way as the bottom end of the piston rod of the port actuator had

    piston rod the same way as on the port side and subsequently, and again when 
    the ramp was forced into closed condition, after the 02.10.94. The following

    the visor was there, thus the pressure escaped to both sides, which cracked 
    open. On the starboard side there was just water, but on the port (inside)

    a certain extent already when the vessel was taken over by N&T from Wasa Line. 
    See Subchapter 6.5. The then already existing damage deteriorated with each 
    opening/closing. Due to the misaligned ramp the bolt of the hinge apparently 
    turned itself further and further to starboard out of the bearing, the securing 
    plate broke and finally the outer lug slipped off the bolt and the inner one 
    broke either simultaneously or subsequently. The port side of the ramp was

    because evidently a gap had opened and the ramp became detached from the vessel 
    in this area and through this gap between forepeak deck and bottom of ramp 
    water could freely penetrate on to the car deck from the visor which was always 
    water-filled at sea. <br>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the pictures/images/drawings 
    shown and explained on the previous pages 847-855 demonstrate the following 
    condition of the bow ramp hinges:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Each hinge consisted 
    of two lugs - one inner, one outer lug - connected to the ramp, one lug connected 
    to the vessel, one hinge bolt and one bearing/bushing. The bolt was secured 
    by one plate at each side which were bolted to the bushing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Evidently the bolt 
    of the port outer hinge had moved inside the bearing/bushing and had broken 
    the securing plates which were missing at both sides. The reader is reminded 
    that already the last Finnish crew had demanded the renewal of this hinge. 
    See also Subchapter 3.4 and 6.5.1.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently 
    due to the misaligned ramp the bolt worked itself to starboard until the outer 
    lug shipped off the bolt, which apparently caused the inner lug to fail. See 
    right the drawing below (PS outside).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg856.JPG" width="361" height="166"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The additional load 
    caused also the port inner hinge - see the left drawing (PS inside) above 
    - to fail after some time leaving the bow ramp detached from the vessel at 
    the entire port side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The detachment 
    of the complete port side of the ramp from the vessel resulted in </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) an increasing 
      misalignment of the whole ramp, and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) an increasing 
      gap between the ramp and the ramp opening of the car deck.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Furthermore the 
    bow ramp in its function as part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck was no more weathertight, i.e. the car deck was open to 
    the sea as the visor was always quickly water-filled at sea.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The gap between 
    bow ramp and car deck ramp opening at the port lower corner extended from 
    the corner to the centre line and upwards to about B-deck level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In way of this 
    gap mattresses, plastic sheets, plastic covered bedding, blankets and rags 
    were found, obviously serving as "sealing material".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - As a result of 
    the port ramp side being detached from the vessel there was also a vertical 
    misalignment between the port ramp side and the adjacent plating of the car 
    deck opening, i.e. the mating lug for the ramp hook and the mating pockets 
    for the securing bolts extending from the adjacent plating were about 100 
    mm higher up now and could no more be reached by the hook respectively by 
    the bolts already for some time before the casualty, i.e. the port side of 
    the bow ramp could not be secured at all for some time before the casualty. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It follows that 
    the entire port side of the bow ramp was not locked/secured upon departure 
    from Tallinn on 27.09.94.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The starboard 
    inner hinge was still intact, but the ramp lugs were subsequently elongated, 
    i.e. worn, and they would have been the next ones to fail. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Also the strong 
    outer starboard hinge showed signs of wear and elongation and hence had lost 
    its initial load-carrying capacity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - This means that 
    at the time of the casualty the bow ramp was merely connected to the vessel 
    by the weaker inner and the stronger outer starboard hinges, both of which, 
    however, were substantially worn and hence their load-carrying capacity was 
    reduced correspondingly.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Damage to 
    the construction</b> - (See drawing page 869) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The inside of 
    the bow ramp</b> is only briefly visible when the diver climbs up the starboard 
    side to the flaps at car deck level, pulls himself up along these flaps to 
    the port side hinges and further to the lower securing bolt with mating pocket. 
    On the ramp plating there are two areas with burnt and/or damaged paint, i.e.: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There is an area 
    of ca. 1 m² located between the upper flaps and the level of the car deck 
    opening where the paint is burnt and the plating is severely distorted. The 
    area is inside the ramp house when the ramp is closed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower area 
    is located in the 3rd row of steel profiles, looking from starboard, which 
    are welded to the ramp plating and the 6th or 7th profile from car deck level 
    as indicated on the picture below by the dark spot. The paint of the plating 
    as well as the two flaps below looks reddish/brown. The plating otherwise 
    does not look affected, but the two flaps are bent and distorted and the car 
    deck plating in way appears to be affected.</font></p>

    plating appears to be intact as far as visible. The rails are completely missing 
    on both sides. - See Subchapter 27.6 and further below in this chapter.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The flaps on the 
    lower side of the ramp normally covering the gap between car deck and ramp 
    were found to be as follows (from starboard to port):</font></p>

    upper part of the raised edge (tire-protection bar) with lug for the preventer 
    wire and upper pocket for the securing bolt were bent towards the inside,

    the bow ramp </b>was found to be damaged very substantially and the damaged 
    areas, according to the ROV inspections on 02. and 09.10.94 compared to the 
    results of the diving investigation on 03.12.94, are demon-strated by the 
    drawing on the following page. It has to be borne in mind that the green shaded 
    area containing the really heavy damage at the centre line of the transverse 
    girders Nos. 3, 4, 5 as counted from the lower side of the ramp is not visible 
    on the videos made on 02. and 09.10.94. This does not mean that it had not 
    been there, but this particular area cannot be seen on the publicly available 
    video footage, because these parts were cut and deleted from the respective 
    videos handed over to this 'Group of Experts' by the members of the Finnish 
    Commission in March 1995 as "raw material". - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The red shaded 
    area represents the contours of the forepeak deck and it is obvious that the 
    damage to the 2nd transverse girder as well as to the two inner vertical girders 
    appears to have been caused by contact with the corresponding parts of the 
    forepeak deck. Also the type of the deep and sharp indentations of the transverse 
    and vertical girders, with local deformations to the adjacent structure, could 
    confirm this. On the other hand the damage to the port vertical girder is 
    comparatively weak, while the most heavy damage to the starboard vertical 
    girder cannot have been caused by contact with the forepeak deck because the 
    two ramp hinges on that side were to some extent intact. The doubts are further 
    increased by the fact that the flatbar housings on the forepeak deck at the 
    four contact areas should be pressed flat, which they were not, and that there 
    should at least be heavy contact marks at the deck edges of the forepeak deck, 
    which however are also missing.</font></p>

    of damages 13/14 to which reference is made in Chapter 32. It is worth mentioning 
    here that there was no chance for the ramp to crash on the bulbous bow as

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Each rail consisted 
    of three fixed sections welded to the raised tire-protection bar, i.e. 4 vertical 
    stanchions with three horizontal rail bars in between. A fifth moveable section 
    was fitted to the most forward stanchion. When the ramp was open these movable 
    sections were swung forward and secured in this position by two pins fitting 
    in corresponding holes. Before the ramp was closed, the movable sections were 
    swung backwards and secured by the pins as can be seen on the above picture 
    and the rails remained in this position during the sea voyage. Thus it has 
    to be assumed that this was also the case during the last voyage. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As parts of 
    the starboard rail, the 4th section with the attached 5th moveable section, 
    were found on the seabed already on 02.10.94 by ROV "Jutta II" - see the image

    it is the starboard side because the movable part is always fixed at the inside 
    of the fourth section if the ramp is open, as visible here and it is also 
    obvious that the lower, bent part was the part attached to the ramp. It is 
    further apparent that the vertical stanchion had been bent and finally cracked 
    off by a force acting from port to starboard. </font></p>

    and the recess of the starboard front bulkhead just below (above) the starboard 
    mating lug for the ramp hook. The area is not visible in detail on the 02.10.94

    that these pallets floated into this position at the very moment when the

    to 130/140°. It has also to be excluded that the pallets floated out of the 
    jammed-in condition by themselves as visible on the footage made on 09.10.94. 
    This means that it has to be assumed that the pallets were manually put into 
    position to avoid total closure of the ramp at some stage and, further, that 
    they probably floated away when the ramp was also manually opened further 
    at sometime after the 09.10.94 but before 03.12.94.<br>

    broken starboard hinges. It turned out that the watch belonged to diver 2 
    (Mark) indicating that he must have been there before apparently engaged in

    disappearing behind something solid, which is apparently not identical to 
    the "sealing material", which had mostly disappeared by then. The rope can 
    be seen coming back slightly deeper as if running through a lug. This is approximately

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These pictures need 
    to be commented as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The support 
      bracket at the outer side of the lug (arrow 1) is larger than the original, 
      which is evident because it overlaps the end of the welding seam (arrow 
      2) which marks the end of the bushing. The support bracket is about 12 mm 
      larger compared to the original one made according to the von Tell drawing 
      No. 49111- 373.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The oblique 
      end of the bracket is just burnt, not grinded (arrow 3). It is considered 
      impossible that the bracket would have left blacksmith's shop of the Meyer 
      Werft in such a condition - see also Subchapter 2.4.6; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The remains of 
      the welding seams at the outer side of the lug were made very unprofessionally 
      when the lug was upright which allows the conclusion that the lug was fixed 
      to the vessel as otherwise the welder would have laid the lug flat. This 
      would have permitted easier welding and would have produced a qualified 
      welding seam. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Qualified 
    welders are able to identify if a welding seam was made when the components 
    were lying flat or were standing upright. The starboard and the centre lugs 
    were shown to one of the very qualified welders of Meyer Werft who identified 
    the welding seams at the support bracket and on the outside of the starboard 
    lug to be rather poor repair welds made when the lug was upright, i.e. fitted 
    to the forepeak deck. See also Subchapter 2.4.6. - As the welds had been made 
    when the lug was upright, i.e. welded to the vessel, it is excluded that they 
    could have been made by Meyer Werft because the bushings were welded to the 
    lugs in the workshop, i.e. the lugs had been lying flat. - See Subchapter 
    2.4.6.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The welds are 
      thin and interrupted, respectively cracked, because they are so thin, which 
      is demonstrated by the corroded surface of the inner side of the lug normally 
      covered by the bushing. As long as the welding seams are intact the space 
      between bushing/lug is airtight, i.e. without oxygen, which was burnt by 
      the heat of the welding process. This was obviously no more the case since 
      some time before the bushing was torn off, because substantial corrosion 
      was able to develop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The forward 
      and aft welding seams between bushing and support bracket are not connected 
      at the outer end (or closed, as the welders say), thus water could penetrate. 
      This confirms the unprofessionalism of the welder who did these repair welds. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Although the 
      welding seams of the inside of the starboard lug and of both sides of the 
      centre lug look much better, they have to be considered fill-up welds according 
      to the Meyer Werft welders, because the welds are higher than the inside 
      of the lug, i.e. the bushing was not resting in the lug, either because 
      the bore was too big from the beginning and/or the lug became elongated 
      as time went by. Therefore the welding seams were mainly used to cover the 
      space between the lug and the bushing at the bottom side of the lugs and 
      thus had only a reduced load-carrying capacity compared to the original 
      as-built condition.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
    26 June 1994 a passenger observed welding work being carried out underneath 
    the open bow ramp while ESTONIA was in Stockholm. It is possible that the 
    repair weldings explained above to starboard lug of the Atlantic lock were 
    carried out then. See also Subchapter 12.5.</font></p>

      G.Lohmann in a personal discussion that the Atlantic lock had been installed

      because evidently the contact plate was bent from starboard to port when 
      the bolt was in original condition. </font></p>

    </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explanation 
    for the bent contact plate of the bolt was presented by the last chairman 
    of the JAIC and its Estonian part, Uno Laur, already at a meeting on 17.01.95 
    in his office in Tallinn when also a member of this 'Group of Experts' was 
    present. He was asked whether he had an explanation for the many fresh footprints 
    on the 2nd and 3rd stringers inside the visor and he replied as follows:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The inside of 
      the visor was not tight and filled quickly with seawater up to outboard 
      level when the vessel was on full speed at sea.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All hydraulic 
      installations, i.e. also the actuators of the Atlantic lock, the bow ramp 
      and the visor were leaking. This caused hydraulic oil to float on the water 
      surface inside the visor. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As soon as the 
      vessel reduced speed and consequently the bow wave became smaller, the water 
      streamed out of the visor and the hydraulic oil settled on the stringers, 
      bottom, etc. - as explained in Chapter 30.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the Atlantic 
      lock could no more be closed hydraulically already since some time before 
      the casualty (probably since the ice winter, March/April 1994) crew members 
      had to go down inside the visor each time before arrival and after departure 
      Tallinn and hammer the bolt open respectively closed through the deformed 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock. Thus they walked from forward to aft and back 
      over the stringers through the freshly settled oil which caused the footprints 
      as can be seen on the next pictures. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above was 
      confirmed by another participant of the meeting, Captain Arvi Myyryläinen, 
      then Hull Manager of The Pohjola Insurance Group, Helsinki. His statement 
      is attached as Enclosure 12.5.175. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The photograph 
    on the next page was made mid January 1995. It shows a view into the visor 
    with the partly oil stained 2nd stringer (arrow 1) and the completely oil 
    covered stringer 3 (arrow 2).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg908.JPG" width="349" height="232"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Also the picture 
    on the next page shows in detail that the footprints were so fresh and clear 
    that even the size of the rubber boots could have been identified. It also 
    demonstrates that there must have been quite some activities down in the visor 
    before the last arrival and after the last departure from Tallinn which cannot 
    just be explained with one or two men going down to hammer the bolt of the 
    Atlantic lock open and closed. There were certainly also other activities 
    going on as will be explained later. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    last time the hydraulic oil settled down on stringer 3 has been before arrival 
    Tallinn in the morning of 27.09.94 when the speed was reduced, the bow wave 
    became small and the water streamed out of the visor. Thereafter the crew 
    entered the visor to hammer open the Atlantic Lock and possibly to carry out 
    other activities. The crew went again inside the visor after departure to 
    hammer the bolt into the Atlantic Lock lugs and to carry out other activities. 
    Subsequently the vessel picked up speed, the bow wave was raising again and 
    the inside of the visor filled within the following hours more or less completely 
    with water, which only left with the lifting of the visor after the casualty. 
    Consequently the fresh footsteps originate from before arrival and after departure 
    on 27.09.94.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg909.JPG" width="345" height="231"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The opening movement 
    of the bolt was from starboard to port and the contact plate was bent from 
    starboard to port. Therefore it has to be assumed that the crew hammered against 
    the contact plate to open the bolt, because there is no other possibility 
    of forcing the bolt open. The hammering marks on the plate are clearly visible. 
    When closing the bolt they hammered directly against the bolt (which is not 
    possible for opening), i.e. against the 2 lugs between which the piston rod 
    of the hydraulic cylinder was fastened by a little bolt. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As can be seen 
    by the next pictures both lugs were bent to the respective outsides and the 
    piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder was also bent.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg910.JPG" width="346" height="310"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Whilst the bending 
    of the lugs is doubtless due to the powerful hammering by crew members when 
    trying to force the bolt through the deformed lugs of the Atlantic lock, it 
    is evident from the hammering marks on the contact plate, as visible on the 
    next image, that they sometimes also hammered against this plate when trying 
    to open the bolt. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following 
    image, taken from the Part-Report of the JAIC, shows these lugs to be full 
    of hammering marks, which are shining like new, without any traces of corrosion, 
    although the fracture surfaces of the broken lugs are heavily corroded. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg911.JPG" width="295" height="209"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It appears strange 
    that hammering marks, undoubtedly originating from hammering about 6 hours 
    before the casualty, appear without any corrosion as can be seen on the above 
    image, whilst fracture surfaces, which are said to originate from fracturing 
    at the time of the casualty, i.e. were exposed to seawater only about 6 hours 
    later, are severely corroded as can also be seen on the same image. This raises 
    doubt whether the lugs of the Atlantic Lock really fractured only during the 
    casualty or much earlier already. </font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- Further detailed 
    explanations: </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A further consequence 
    of the water-filled visor were repeated problems with the magnetic limit switches 
    of the Atlantic lock which had replaced the mechanical sensors sometime in 
    1985/86 - see Subchapter 3.4 - and which controlled the red/green indicator 
    lights of the control panel on the car deck (see Subchapter 2.6.4). These 
    limit switches were most probably damaged by ice hacking inside the visor 
    in winter 1994. When this was realised by those in charge and when it further 
    turned out that the Atlantic lock could no more be operated hydraulically 
    because the lugs were deformed also by ice hacking and the visor was misaligned, 
    it was decided to dismount the damaged limit switches completely and the cables 
    were cut off. The video prints below show the cut off cables and the empty 
    sensor plate.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg912.JPG" width="370" height="321"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The motivation for 
    not replacing the dismounted magnetic limit switches was primarily the rather 
    high price for new ones and the apparent fact that crew members had to go 
    down anyway after the closing respectively before the opening of the visor 
    to close respectively open the bolt manually by hammering, thus there was 
    a direct control and no remote control was required.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Neither B.V. 
    nor the E.N.M.B. were informed about this severe violation of safety rules 
    which rendered the vessel initially unseaworthy and should have caused B.V. 
    to withdraw the class in hindsight.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
    the information outlined above was brought to the attention of B.V. they invited 
    the owners, i.e. N&T, to comment on the dismounted limit switches and the 
    obviously cut-off cables. Although the images from the underwater videos demonstrate 
    quite clearly that the limit switches and cables were not torn off in the 
    course of the casualty sequence-of-events, B.V. apparently finally believed 
    the many crew witnesses stating that the installation had been complete and 
    in proper working order only a few days before the catastrophe. Also the JAIC 
    finally accepted the explanations by N&T/the crew, although earlier there 
    had been different opinions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Image<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Nos. 13/16 
    are showing the bent contact plate attached to the bolt on the piston rod 
    side, and the two bent lugs between which the piston rod was fitted to the 
    bolt by a steel pin, all of which has been commented above already. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Summary of Facts 
    presented on the Atlantic Lock:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) All three lugs 
    evidently failed in the forward/upward direction, which is only possible if 
    the visor hinges were broken before - see Subchapter 34.2 - Results of the 
    Finite Element Analysis of the Visor - because as long as the visor is attached 
    to all five respectively seven fixing points the force direction is aft/upwards 
    and the load on the Atlantic lock is only in the range of 50/60 ts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The lugs failed 
    in their thinnest sections and the upper fracture surfaces of all 3 lugs look 
    more or less the same while the fracture surfaces of the lower ones look totally 
    different, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard 
      lug lower fracture runs obliquely from the upper point of the fracture towards 
      the lower forward side of the lug and the fracture surface is severely corroded.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The centre 
      lug lower fracture looks completely different because the fracture runs 
      horizontally from the point of fracture on the inside towards the outside 
      or vice versa. Also this fracture surface is severely corroded. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- according 
      to the available videos the port lug lower fracture has apparently been 
      subject to pounding. The initial condition cannot be determined anymore 
      because the lug was destroyed for testing purposes. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The upper part 
    of the starboard lug was found to be bent to starboard, while the upper parts 
    of the centre and port lugs were straight. The lower part of the starboard 
    lug was straight while the lower parts of the centre and port lugs were bent 
    to port.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The welding 
    seams also show quite different pictures, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard 
      lug and the support bracket: <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding 
      seams between the support bracket, which was much larger than the original 
      and the support bushing as well as the welding seams at the outer side of 
      the lug between the lug and the support bushing were obviously very unprofessionally 
      made repair welds when the lug was in upright position which allows the 
      conclusion that the lugs were fixed to the forepeak deck when being repair 
      welded.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding 
      seams on the inner side between the lug and the support bushing look much 
      better but are according to the professional welders of Meyer Werft so-called 
      fill-up welds and are much thinner than the initial welds were, viz. only 
      about 3 mm whereas the initial welds were 7-8 mm - see also Subchapter 2.4.6<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the centre 
      lug has also fill-up welding seams on both sides of only about 3 mm thickness;<br>
      - the port lug could not be examined since it was destroyed for testing 
      purposes on behalf of the JAIC. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) In summary of 
    items (1) to (4) the following has to be considered established:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The visible 
      welding seams on the starboard and centre lugs and the support bracket of 
      the starboard lug were not original, thus it has to be concluded that the 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were no more the original ones installed by Meyer 
      Werft - see also Subchapter 3.3.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding 
      seams in way of the outer side of the starboard lug including support bracket/support 
      bushing were poor quality repair welds made when the lug was in upright 
      condition.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The other 
      welding seams between lugs/bushing were fill-up welds of just 3 mm instead 
      of 7-8 mm in the original condition.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In particular 
      the lower fracture surface of the starboard lug showed severe corrosion 
      even though blank metal without any corrosion could be seen on the insides 
      of the lugs and on the upper part of the bolt despite these parts should 
      have become exposed to seawater at the same time as the lower fracture surface 
      of the starboard lug. This could indicate that the fracture - at least of 
      the starboard lug - existed already before the casualty.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Due to 
      the above-explained changes compared to the original condition the load-carrying 
      capacity of the complete installation had been considerably reduced.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The locking 
      bolt showed 2 areas of contact indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully 
      extended and sometimes only partly when in locked position which indicates 
      misalignment between the lugs on the vessel and/or between the lugs on the 
      vessel and the visor lug. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The steel 
      plate attached to the bolt was hammered bent from starboard to port since 
      this is the only way to move the bolt from closed to open position by means 
      of a hammer which confirms the above. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The lugs 
      between which the piston rod was fitted to the bolt were hammered apart 
      since hammering on these lugs was the most effective way to hammer the bolt 
      from open to closed position which further confirms the above.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the 
      three lugs of the Atlantic lock were deformed and misaligned to such an 
      extent that the Atlantic lock could no more be locked/unlocked by means 
      of the hydraulic actuator remotely controlled from the control panel on 
      the car deck, it had to be locked/unlocked by crew members by means of hammering. 
      See Enclosure 12.5.175.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The sensor 
      plate was empty and there are no indications that the limit switches had 
      been fitted to it at or shortly before the casualty. The inside of the drilled 
      holes show corrosion indicating that the limit switches had been dismounted 
      some time before the casualty when also the cables were cut.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The scoring 
      marks and removed paint at the upper forward side of the sensor plate do 
      originate from hammering by crew members to bend the plate further aft, 
      i.e. away from the hammering area of the bolt which is a further confirmation 
      for the above. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the 
      bolt - after having been recovered by the divers - was thrown back into 
      the sea by a member of the JAIC and the sensor plate - although having been 
      burnt off by the diver - was thrown away and not brought to the surface, 
      these important pieces of evidence could not be examined. </font></p>

  The Car Deck</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Very little is known 
    about the inside of the car deck except for the observations made when the 
    diver went down (up) the starboard inner bulkhead, inside the ramp towards 
    the car deck. A lot of pallets and dunnage were noted to be piled up to the 
    left of his way, with other debris and what appeared to be parts of the ramp 
    rails mixed between. Behind the debris at least one, probably two big holes 
    in the bulkhead are visible which will be discussed in Chapter 32. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper 
    part of the ramp opening was considerably damaged indicating that something 
    big had smashed against it, no scoring marks are visible and the area of the 
    inner bulkhead is covered by the above-mentioned debris. It is possible that 
    this damage was caused by the visor - see Chapter 31 - during the casualty 
    sequence-of-events.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The condition of 
    the bow ramp flaps on the car deck side have already been explained in the 
    previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - and the big hole noted in the port 
    inner bulkhead below the control panel and adjacent to the port outer ramp 
    hinge will be discussed in Chapter 32. In spite of various attempts and although 
    the supervisor frequently said so, the ROV was apparently never inside the 
    car deck according to the evaluation of Disengage - see Disengage Report Subchapter 
    34.6 - and if the ROV actually should have been inside the car deck it definitely 
    did not enter it via the opening at the bow ramp but then it must have been 
    through such a big hole in the starboard shell plating that the edges were 
    not visible while the ROV moved through. This is doubtful but cannot be excluded 
    because the relevant part of the Sprint ROV video tape B40b has been cut several 
    times. - See Subchapter 34.6. in any event on the uncensored part of this 
    tape cement bags on pallets shrinked by plastic foil and other cargo parts, 
    however no truck or trailers, can bee seen which then has to be on the seabed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This immediately 
    raises the question of how they got there because it is most unlikely that 
    this cargo originates from another vessel as it looks rather new and unaffected 
    by sediments. It can also be excluded that the cargo fell out of the open 
    bow ramp when the vessel was upside down because she was then down by the 
    stern and it is physically impossible for pallets to move off some truck or 
    trailer on to the car deck and then ahead on to the bow ramp and then to fall 
    off the bow ramp. This leaves a sufficiently big hole in the shell plating 
    in way of the forward starboard side of the car deck which indeed cannot be 
    excluded and is - as a matter of fact - the only possibility. As the observations 
    described above were made by the ROV on 3 December 1994, i.e. more than 2 
    months after the casualty, there are two possibilities, viz.: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) heavy objects 
      from inside the car deck crashed against the shell plating and broke through 
      it either during the big heel, which is unlikely, and/or subsequently<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) a hole 
      was blown or flame-cut from the outside into the car deck to get access 
      after the casualty. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to be able 
    to explain further observations on the car deck by survivors also the fire-fighting 
    system installed here - a sprinkler system called Drencher system - has to 
    be explained as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck 
      there were also heat-sensors installed, which activated control lights on 
      the bridge indicating the particular area. By pushing a respective bottom 
      the watch officer started the fire pump and activated one or more quick-opening 
      valves of the sprinkler system installed underneath the car deck ceiling, 
      i.e. below the 4th deck. This sprinkler fire protection system was spraying 
      water out of nozzles under high pressure all over the area and the fire 
      pump was continuously pumping water into the system. This sprinkler pump 
      could also be activated from the ECR and from the sprinkler room (B-deck 
      level in the aft part of the centre casing). It was connected to the emergency 
      generator. This means that this pump has been running until the vessel was 
      more or less on the side. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this connection 
      the observation of passenger Juuse Veljo is of importance who testified 
      among others <i>"On my way down the port side in about the middle of the 
      ship I reached the fender bar and heard the noise of pumps. While I was 
      still sitting on the edge the light started to blink."</i> - See his statement 
      <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.245.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      20.245</a>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    emergency generator then still running was supplying power to three pumps, 
    viz.: the bilge pump, the fire pump and the sprinkler pump. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is possible that 
    the sprinkler pump was then still running together with the bilge pump, which 
    according to Margus Treu, Henrik Sillaste and Hannes Kadak was also running 
    already since or even before the big heel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Furthermore there 
    are some observations/indications which could point to a fire in the forward 
    part of the car deck. These are</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) the statement 
    of the watch engineer Margus Treu that a jet of water hit the lens of the 
    video camera transferring pictures from the partly open bow ramp to the monitor 
    in the engine control room (ECR) where he was watching - see his statement 
    dated 29.09.94 Turku - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.263.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.3.263.</a> Treu believed that this water jet came from the partly open 
    bow ramp, which however is not possible because the camera is fitted at the 
    forward part of the centre casing underneath the ceiling. The distance to 
    the bow ramp is 25 m and the height above car deck is about 5 m - see the 
    pictures below taken on board the near-sister DIANA II where the camera was 
    installed as on ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg919.JPG" width="394" height="237"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can thus be excluded 
    that water penetrating the bow ramp at that relatively early stage could have 
    reached the camera in such high position as much as the car deck between bow 
    ramp and camera was full of trucks and cars.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is much more 
    likely that the camera lens was hit by a jet of water from the sprinkler installation 
    which had been activated manually in the forward part of the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) It has been 
    explained in the previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - that the lower 
    part of the ramp in way of the two flaps in the middle was noted to be reddish/brown 
    with the flaps being bent and distorted and possible damage to car deck plating. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The passenger 
    Bengt Nilsson has testified that he saw white powder and foam inside the centre 
    casing on car deck level next to the 4th car deck door from forward on starboard 
    side. He rushed past this door on his way up when the vessel heeled abruptly 
    to starboard and he had to hold with his hands against the wall when he noted 
    the above. It was so fresh that the foam was still running down the wall. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The coded fire 
    alarm for the crew "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" was heard from the loud speakers, 
    though only after the big heel when there was already full panic. It meant 
    that Fire Group No. 1 had to assemble below the starboard bridge wing on deck 
    8 and Fire Group No. 2 had to assemble on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) There are indications 
    that the crew had been active on the car deck before the big heel. See the 
    statement of Altti Hakanpää - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.333.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.333</a> and the different statements of Margus Treu in respect of his 
    seeing Silver Linde on the car deck - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.261.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    21.2.3.261</a> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.273.htm" target="_blank">21.2.3.273</a>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It is certain 
    that the crew knows much more about what happened on the car deck, but remain 
    silent, so far. It has to be assumed that this knowledge relates to the circumstances 
    described in Chapter 32 - Unexplained Damage. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This particular area 
    of the wreck above the mudline was carefully examined by divers and ROV because 
    a surprisingly big part was accessible, much more than it could be assumed 
    with a vessel lying on her starboard side. The reason is, as demonstrated 
    by the drawings below taken from the Smit-Tak Report - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.410</a> - that the superstructure was buried into the sea bottom. Therefore 
    the wreck had a list of about 120° with the bottom up and a substantial part 
    of the starboard hull side was accessible above the bilge strake partly up 
    to car deck level.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    over the whole length of the wreck the starboard shell plating in way of the 
    0-deck is accessible which includes the heeling tank and stabiliser pocket 
    areas. The same is true for the 1st deck which is accessible in most parts 
    while the car deck can only be reached in way of section D, which is aft of 
    the bridge. The drawing on the next page - also taken from the Smit-Tak Report 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    had been a lot of water on the 1st deck already before the big starboard heel 
    which escaped from 0-deck under pressure in way of the 4th compartment and 
    probably also came up the spiral stairway and the lift casing in the 3rd compartment. 
    - See the statement of Carl-Erik Reintamm attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.1.289.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the water 
    coming up from 0-deck to deck 1 had been under pressure - see the statement 
    of Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151</a> - there must have been a connection to the outside. As the 
    port side of the shell plating is apparently undamaged according to the ROV 
    inspections on 02.10.94 and 09.10.94 it has to be assumed that there must 
    be one or more holes in the starboard side.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the starboard 
    shell plating in way of 0-deck is accessible over the whole length of the 
    wreck - see the 2 drawings on the previous pages - and has been carefully 
    examined by ROV and divers during the mudline surveys, it is certain that 
    respective video material is available. The "official" mudline video is, however, 
    censored, i.e. the relevant parts were deleted - see also the Disengage Report 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.6.434.</a> Nevertheless, careful evaluation of the available mudline video 
    does reveal very substantial damage to the starboard shell plating and bottom 
    plating above and below the bilge keel as demonstrated by the images below.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking at the 
    images presented here it is difficult to assume that this vessel had been 
    in drydock only 8 months before, because the starboard side is really in a 
    very bad condition, actually much worse as it is possible to demonstrate by 
    images. Very deep indentations between the frames and deep scoring marks, 
    partly not even corroded, are the rule, however, in some particular areas 
    the plating is even holed as e.g. can be seen from the image below. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg931b.JPG" width="276" height="214"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Enhancement by means 
    of special equipment confirmed indeed that the plating is holed - See the 
    enhancement below.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg932a.JPG" width="516" height="207"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the damage 
    appearance it has to be concluded that the plate was severely corroded, i.e. 
    the hole was neither caused by an impact of ex- or implosion but by corrosion. 
    This is easily possible if the coating and/or anode protection of a ballast 
    water tank, e.g. a heeling tank, was not in order. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following two 
    images show an area which is apparently also holed, but not by corrosion because 
    the edges are too sharp.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In any event the 
    ferry ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on her last voyage with one or more starboard 
    ballast water tanks, possibly even the heeling tank, open to the sea. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated above 
    - see Chapter 17 - revised stability calculations showed that the vessel must 
    have had about 200 ts additional weight on the starboard side which could 
    not be pumped. The theoretical possibilities of unconfirmed flooding of compartments 
    through holes to the outside was discussed as the reader may remember. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The possibility 
    now turns to a fact. The vessel had holes in her underwater shell plating. 
    The obvious effect on the seaworthiness of the ferry needs not to be discussed. 
    The fact that the JAIC, having worked on the interpretation of those videos, 
    does not mention anything in this regard, is undebatable too. </font></p>

  The Stabilisers</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In January 
    1994 the ESTONIA was fitted with stabilisers of make Brown Brothers which 
    had allegedly been in operation at the time of the casualty. According to 
    3rd engineer Margus Treu, the fins should retract automatically at speeds 
    below 4 kn, therefore he does not believe that survivors could have seen the 
    port stabiliser still out when the vessel was already almost on the side - 
    see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.271.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    21.2.3.271</a> - Protocol of Landvetter meeting on 31.03.95.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In all 
    probability Margus Treu is right because only after proper questioning of 
    the survivors Pierre Thiger, Tony Spuhl and Mats Hillerström did it turn out 
    that what they believed to have been the stabiliser was much too much forward 
    to assume it could have been the stabiliser. They saw something big, partly 
    white, partly dark, vertically bigger than transverse, which was moving in/out 
    and/or up/down, very far forward, almost at the bow. They saw it still when 
    the vessel was on the side already. The statement of Pierre Thiger taken on 
    08.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.414 and the statement of Tony Spuhl 
    taken on 10.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.415. The statement of Mats 
    Hillerström is not yet available. The actual stabiliser, however, is installed 
    in a pocket behind the heeling tank on 0-dek level, i.e. about midships. When 
    the witnesses were informed accordingly they categorically denied having seen 
    anything moving in this area. This leads to the conclusion that the survivors 
    had seen the visor, then still hanging on the bow ramp with the bottom attached 
    to the forepeak deck and ice- knife of the bulbous bow.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This leaves 
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk who has stated - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.1.251.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.1.251</a> - that the stern was down to the stabiliser fin level. But 
    he did not say that the fin was out. Therefore, it has to be assumed that 
    the survivors actually meant the visor when they mentioned the stabiliser 
    during the last stage before leaving the vessel.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event 
    the port stabiliser fin was found to be in its pocket during the ROV inspection

    curve of hull at forward of <b>stabiliser</b> 1 mtr gap from hull to M/L (mudline) 
    straight through.« </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the stated 
    depth of 80.7 m before and 81.8 m after the above entry, it has to be concluded 
    that it was the deep starboard side because above the port stabiliser there 
    is only about 50 m of water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> If the stabiliser 
    should be there in its pocket, why did the JAIC then censor the video? Probably 
    it is not there because there have been and still are continuous rumours that 
    the starboard stabiliser had not been installed properly in January 1994 - 
    see Subchapter 12.5.5 - and ever since did malfunction from time to time and 
    consequently might have broken off on the night of the casualty due to a too 
    weak construction. In this connection the statement of the passenger from 
    the 1st deck, Bengt Nilsson, recently taken in Stockholm - see Enclosure 29.6.416 
    - is of relevance, because he explains the metallic crack-ing/breaking noises 
    heard by him when still lying in his bed as having come exactly from the direction 
    where the starboard stabiliser fin had been installed. This indicates that 
    the fin could have broken off. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Alternatively the 
    stabiliser fin could have broken off by the object sliding against the vessel's 
    starboard side by which the scraping noises were caused. The noise scenario 
    for Bengt Nilsson would have been the same. Therefore the video footage showing 
    the ROV inspection of the sea bottom was analysed and the following two images 
    were found which could show parts of the stabiliser fin. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg938.jpg" width="352" height="648"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image 
    is a single frame from a cut tape which vaguely shows something long on the 
    seabed which the Finnish Commission did not want the public to see in detail.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg939.jpg" width="385" height="295"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be concluded that the <b>port stabiliser</b> in all probability moved into 
    its pocket when the speed dropped below 4 kn which had been the case already 
    before the big heel. It has further to be concluded that the object seen by 
    some of the survivors far forward on the port side, which was moving in/out 
    or up/down, was most likely the visor. These observations were still being 
    made when the vessel was already on her side, i.e. at 01.30 hours or later. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the <b>starboard 
    stabiliser</b> there are strong indications that it broke off or was broken 
    off and is resting on the sea bottom now. In both cases a substantial water 
    ingress into the engine room - at least 2 watertight compart-ments were affected 
    - would have been the result for which there are also indications, because 
    Henrik Sillaste has testified that the bilge pumps were running and Margus 
    Treu has stated they were trying to pump water out of the ship. As it is not 
    possible to pump water from the car deck they can only have pumped from 1st 
    deck and 0-deck. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">While the ferry was 
    sinking in completely upside down condition the stern area had the first contact 
    with the sea bottom. The bow was still above sea level at this time with the

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the superstructure 
    in way of the port side aft part of the 8th and 7th decks were found to be 
    indented and bulged by the divers it has to be assumed that she was somewhat 
    more heeled to port when touching the sea bottom as a result of which the 
    above indentations were caused. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ROV tape made 
    on 02.10.94 indicates that the starboard stern ramp is slightly open as can 
    be seen on the adjacent image. It shows the upper inner side. The explanation 
    for this slight opening was given already in Subchapter 21.3.3 by the statement 
    of Rolf Sörman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.335.1</a> - who, as well as his seminar colleagues, were disturbed 
    to such extent by hydraulic noises that they gave up their conference at 21.45 
    hours ET.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the 2nd main 
    hydraulic station was located at the starboard side aft on the car deck level 
    directly below the conference area this is the only installation able to produce 
    the explained disturbing noise level. It can furthermore be reasonably assumed 
    that the hydraulic pumps had been started and kept running to open the starboard 
    stern ramp slightly by means of the ice breaking cylinders and keep the ramp 
    in this position by operating the control time and again in the closing mode 
    to press the ramp against the ice breaking cylinders as it would otherwise 
    more open/close due to the very hard pitching of the ferry. The slight opening 
    of the starboard stern ramp allowed the excessive water on the car deck, continuously 
    penetrating through the unclosed bow ramp from the water filled visor, to 
    run out at the stern. This worked, of course, only as long as the ferry had 
    a stern trim and a starboard list. Both was the case until about 23.30 hours 
    when the visor was more or less full and the trim changed to down by head. 
    For further details see Chapter 31 - The Casualty Scenario. The pictures below 
    show the stern ramp arrangements in port. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg942.jpg" width="493" height="236"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed 
    that the starboard stern ramp was completely unlocked as it otherwise could 
    not be slightly open and that the reason for this slightly open condition 
    is the almost upside down condition of the wreck. It has further to be assumed 
    that the stern ramp has been much more open during casualty sequence-of-events 
    because latest after the shut-down of the auxiliary diesels the hydraulic 
    pumps stopped since not being connected to the emergency generator. This means 
    that subsequently the starboard stern ramp slowly opened completely or more 
    or less completely while the ferry heeled more and more to starboard which 
    led to massive water ingress onto the car deck and through the big lift opening 
    at the aft end of the centre casing also into the large provision area in 
    the aft of deck 1 and so on. This is most probably the explanation for the 
    ferry sinking by the stern. </font></p>

    images explained on the previous pages. The distance from the bow ramp - arrow 
    1 - to the corner of the bulkhead - arrow 2 - is about 4 m. Below the dotted

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3">33.1<br>
    The "DIANA II" Incident in January 1993</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As this relatively 
    minor incident was made into a near catastrophe by the Nordic media with the 
    visor allegedly almost lost, clarification was needed and thus the matter 
    was also investigated by this 'Group of Experts' with the following result:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">DIANA II was 
    delivered by Meyer Werft in 1979 as forerunner and near-sister of the ESTONIA. 
    The DIANA II as well as the VIKING SALLY (later ESTONIA) were trading in the 
    Viking Line service between Stockholm-Mariehamn-Turku until 1990. From the 
    chief mate Karl Ole Lindroos, who had practically been on board from the time 
    of delivery until 1990, as well as from the mate and master Thorsten Söder, 
    who served in this rank for many years, the following information has been 
    received:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was well known 
    to all navigators that the bow visor was the most sensitive part of the vessel 
    and was endangered in head-on seas at too high speed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor was the 
    responsibility of the chief mate who also opened and closed it. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were always 
    problems at the time of opening and closing the bolt of the Atlantic lock, 
    so that the bolt was finally thinned by 5 mm. After the visor had once been 
    lowered with already closed bolt of the Atlantic lock, the bolt had to be 
    renewed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before it was possible 
    to open the locking devices it was necessary to press the visor hydraulically 
    down as otherwise the bolts could not have been opened respectively closed 
    hydraulically against the pressure of the rubber packings.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the winter 
    time there were always problems with the rubber packings being frozen to the 
    visor bottom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It often occurred 
    that the visor closed with a loud "bang" as the man at the operating panel 
    could not see the respective position of the visor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> About one year 
    before changing from the Slite Line to the Trelleborg-Rostock Line (TR Line) 
    the pistons of the hydraulic cylinders were newly coated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the bankruptcy 
    of Slite Line in 1992 DIANA II was taken over by TR Line on basis of a bareboat. 
    At first the Slite crew remained partly on board. Thorsten Söder and Lennart 
    Elfors remained masters and Karl Ole Lindroos was one of the two chief mates 
    for several months.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was 
    engaged in the Rostock-Trelleborg service and made three trips daily, two 
    of which were carried out during the daylight at full speed and one during 
    the night with the speed reduced to ca. 12 kn. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the morning of<b> 
    16 January 1993</b> during the voyage from Rostock to Trelleborg - i.e. two 
    days after the hurricane in which the JAN HEWELIUSZ sank - there was again 
    a storm of Bft. 10 blowing. Captain Söder was already on board the DIANA II 
    to take-over the command from Captain Elfors after arrival in Trelleborg. 
    The vessel proceeded through the very rough sea at ca. 12 kn. The chief mates 
    Lindroos and Hartwigsson were on their handing-over round just in the forward 
    part of the car deck when they noticed water leaking through the bow ramp. 
    After the vessel had reached the shelter of the shore, both mates entered 
    the inside of the visor through the hatch on the forecastle deck and found 
    considerable damage to the hydraulic side locks (the manual side locks were 
    not engaged) as well as to the Atlantic lock. After arrival the Classification 
    Society B.V., Sjöfartsverket as well as TR Line were immediately informed 
    and the responsible TR inspector instructed the master to have the damage 
    repaired prior to the next departure.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ship's command 
    entered the following remarks into the logbook:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Upon arrival 
        Trelleborg the following damage was found to the bow visor: Locking devices

      at sea went down between the forward ramp and the visor to see if the packing 
      was leaking significantly. When they went down, the damages to the visor 
      were discovered. On arrival at Trelleborg on 16 January 1993, they had a 
      close look while the visor was opened. Thereafter the repairs were ordered 
      through TR-Line in Trelleborg. The captain said that the weather had been 
      bad for a few days, 15-25 m/s high waves, and it was dark. Thus, the damages 
      might have happened several days before the 16 January 1993. He does not 
      know when or under what circumstances the damages were suffered. The captain

    the lug hangs on the bolt of the hydraulic locking device and after opening 
    the same it falls into the water. As noticed from the letter of the B.V. lawyer 
    Johnsson, the repairs had already been commenced when the B.V. surveyor boarded

    a hard blow of the sea. Therefore the TR Line inspector Griesmaier is of the 
    opinion that the damage to the locking devices occurred over a longer period.

    Stockholm-Tallinn service in addition to the ESTONIA. First inspections were 
    carried out which included checking of the B.V. survey reports on board, thus

    of the B.V. surveyor Kirchhoff and the N&T inspector Hobro, all locking devices 
    were opened and closed with closed visor, the indicator lights were checked 
    and all found to be in order. The vessel remained in Warnemünde until 4 or 
    5 October 1994. As a consequence of the ESTONIA accident the bow visor was 
    welded closed, however, broke open again during her subsequent voyage to Turku.</font></li>

        - the bushing for the spring loaded securing bolt fitted to the bushing 
        between the port and the centre lugs was present;<br>
        - the visor lug was oval and fixed to a bar, running diagonally upwards. 
        This was not in conformity with the lug as per drawing No. 48611-373;<br>
        - at the centre and port lugs and possibly at the sensor plate there were 
        two angle bars in athwartships direction, from where a pipe was leading 
        to the cross beam of the 3rd stringer level of the visor;<br>
        - below this cross beam (round) a double T-beam was fitted, probably to 
        give the visor more transverse strength in the bow wave area (ice);<br>
        - the sensors should have been fitted to the 2nd stringer level (mode

    Tunis, for service between Tunis-Genua-Marseille by the Nobiskrug Shipyard/Rendsburg 
    in 1978. The vessel has a length of 145.73 m, a breadth of 23.51 m and a draught

    wind: West Bft. 9-10, speed 15.8 kn. From 07.00 hours onwards they were sailing

  with regard to the loads on the bow visor at the time of the accident. Moreover, 
  the report contains misinterpretations and neglects possible influence factors 
  on the visor failure such as maintenance conditions of the structures in question

    to the technical group of the JAIC - Börje Stenström - Tuomo Karppinen - Klaus 
    Rahka - to have mock-ups built and tested to destruction by an institute of 
    their choice, also by the Finnish VTT where both Karppinen and Rahka were 
    employed. This was, however, not possible as this institute did not have sufficient 
    pulling power, agreement was reached to have the break- tests carried out 
    by the Institute of Naval Architecture (Institut für Schiffbau) in Hamburg 
    and four mock-ups were built according to the suggestions of Stenström/Rahka 
    which were identical with exception of the welding seams between the bushing 
    starboard lug and the housing/centre- and port-lugs.<br>

    of the starboard and centre lugs; it has to be assumed, however, that it would 
    have broken if the pulling had been continued as it had been in practice.

    Bow Impact of Ro-Ro Vessels by Det Norske Veritas</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This paper - given 
    to the Society of Naval Architects of Japan by Det norske Veritas (DnV) - 
    concentrates on design load aspects for the bow area and presents results 
    of recent work carried out by DnV with the aim of evaluating the long term 
    bow impact loads that a Ro-Ro vessel may be subjected to during its operational 
    life. The reason why it has been incorporated into this report is the obvious 
    fact that the results are partly absolutely contrary to the findings of the 
    JAIC. The paper is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.5.433.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.5.433</a> and the conclusions are as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow impact 
      of five different Ro-Ro vessels is studied numerically and empirically. 
      Impact is considered both from an ultimate and a fatigue point of view. 
      For the ultimate load case, the loads are found to be strongly a function 
      of the wave height and the forward vessel speed. this illustrates the importance 
      of speed reductions in rough seas. The study also shows that the highest 
      waves do not necessarily induce the highest impact loads on the structure. 
      The bow impact loads from the DnV Classification Rules are intended to cover 
      all types of designs and design conditions.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A 
      fatigue investigation of the bow door support system for one typical vessel 
      has been carried out. A long term distribution of the bow forces has been 
      established based upon a gradual speed reduction when wave height exceeds 
      significant wave height = 5 meter. The results of the analysis show a fatigue 
      life exceeding 66 years when using the North Atlantic wave climate as basis 
      and <b>constant operation in head seas</b>. This corresponds to 400 years 
      fatigue life for operation in all headings and on this basis it is concluded 
      that fatigue does not represent a problem provided the vessel is operated 
      with good seamanship. These conclusions are based upon the assumption that 
      the bow doors are designed for ultimate loads according to the DnV 1994 
      Rules and that NV36 strength steel or lower is applied. The welded details 
      are according to normal ship practice and with an intact corrosion protection.«

  <i>Investigation Report of Video Tapes Featuring the<br>
  Car/Passenger Ferry "Estonia"</i> by Disengage, Axminster/UK</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All the video tapes 
    available to this 'Group of Experts' showing the ESTONIA afloat and on the 
    bottom of the sea were supplied to Disengage/UK specialised in the evaluation 
    and interpretation of video tapes and the production of video images. The 
    aim of the investigation conducted by Disengage at the beginning was to assist 
    the explosive expert Mr. B. Braidwood in identifying possible explosion damage 
    to the vessel. This has been completed and now the aim has been to identify 
    the technical nature of the videos, provide fully detailed listings of the 
    content of the cassettes, provide still images of any items of possible interest 
    to the overall investigation and identify any anomalies in the content of 
    the cassettes including missing sections of tape and unidentified activity 
    of wreck site. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thirteen cassettes 
    have been submitted to Disengage for analysis. Of these 13 cassettes 4 stem 
    from diver activity and 9 were filmed by remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs). 
    This includes 3 tapes that are duplicates. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are two 
    main differences between videos made by ROVs and videos made by divers.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ROV videos 
    show data on screen during recording, including date, time, course, depth 
    and camera pitch angle. The ROVs are also generally well lit due to them carrying 
    more than one light to conduct filming.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The diver videos 
    carry no data on screen resulting in dates and times being estimated from 
    brief official documentation and on screen encounters with ROVs from which 
    information is available. The picture quality of the divers videos is also 
    hampered because of the poor lighting used on the head mounted cameras. The 
    single very bright light tends to bleach out the images which effect has been 
    worsened during the duplication process.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation 
    into the cause for the excessive brightness and unclear, foggy pictures revealed 
    that the contractor Rockwater made the original master recordings of the underwater 
    survey on VHS cassettes in a PAL format, however, tests have shown that the 
    copies supplied have been played back and duplicated on PAL/SECAM machines 
    without the necessary converters in place. This has created the breakdown 
    in colour definition, excessive brightness and tracking problems making accurate 
    work with the video tapes very difficult and sometimes impossible. The contractor 
    Rockwater was further requested to explain why so many, and partly long, video 
    pauses had been made respectively long parts of the tapes were just flickering. 
    Their reply was that it is normal practice for cameras to continue recording, 
    for safety and continuity, throughout a survey whether it is conducted by 
    ROVs or divers which is especially relevant when an ROV such as the Sprint 
    unit is used, because it is only image platform with no other capacity than 
    the collection of stills and video. As out of 13 cassettes reviewed only 4 
    have no cuts (because they were most probably made for demonstration purposes) 
    it is quite obvious that these cuts do not fall into the responsibility of 
    the contractor Rockwater, but were made elsewhere. It has also become apparent 
    that the breaks basically occur in the same areas of the vessel, for example 
    the starboard shell plating in way of the 0-deck below the bridge and funnel. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another concern 
    regarding the cuts in the footage is the relationship between the on screen 
    timing and the VHS time code. Most of the occasions when a tape cut takes 
    place the elapsed time on the ROV 'on screen clock' is greater than that on 
    the VHS cassettes when most of the cuts in the footage were made at the time 
    of duplication and not when the survey was taking place.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary Disengage 
    has made the following main findings:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there is evidence that 
    between these dates there has been movement of what would be expected to be 
    stationary items such as ropes and debris. This is most clear on the hawsers 
    to the port side of the bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there are occasions 
    when other activity is taking place on the wreck, visible by other ROV and 
    diver lights on footage. This activity is not covered in the available cassettes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There are areas 
    on the vessel that have not been surveyed enough to be documented properly. 
    These areas are either missing from the footage due to cuts in the footage 
    or because of a lack of detailed investigation when the ROV or divers are 
    in the area.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This refers in 
    particular to the starboard mudline, bow ramp hydraulic actuators and ramp 
    locking hooks, seabed debris and the car deck in general. On the occasions 
    when the ROV got to the starboard mudline the tape is cut between the funnel 
    and bridge or until the ROV arrives at the starboard rudder or moves to another 
    area on the hull away from the mudline.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bow ramp actuators 
    have both been bent and damaged, however the diver does not attempt to conduct 
    any kind of detailed investigation. Apart from a brief comment about the eye 
    on the end of the starboard actuator on tape B40c/number 19 there is no other 
    comment or video documentation of these important items.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is possible 
    to access the car deck and on tape B40c/number 19 the diver enters it to inspect 
    the ramp securing bolts and mating pockets. On the respective video there 
    is remarkable damage briefly visible which is totally ignored by both the 
    diver and his supervisor and all the many others in the control room on board 
    of SEMI I who were watching what the diver was doing and frequently interfered 
    with instructions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For example, the 
    diver briefly looked onto a big damage to the port longitudinal car deck bulkhead 
    when he was climbing up the bottom flaps of the bow ramp from starboard to 
    port. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On cassette B40b/number 
    20 the ROV attempts on several occasions to enter the car deck and fails. 
    On several of these occasions the operator believes he has entered the car 
    deck, but then discovers he's wrong and on the seabed. On the final occasion 
    they are sure they have entered and this is very difficult to confirm due 
    to several cuts in the tape, but on the later diver cassette B40e/number 10 
    from the same date and time the diver sees the ROV on the seabed at the same 
    time as this footage. Due to the large number of cuts on this ROV tape B40b/number 
    20, including one cut of nearly one hour, no conclusions can be made. There 
    is however some confusion in this ROVs activities as during the hour long 
    cut in the ROVs footage the diver sees the ROV active and inside the bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the limited 
    footage available from the seabed near the starboard bow of the vessel at 
    a depth of 91 m it is difficult to identify many of the pieces visible, however, 
    some wooden pallets with cement bags on can be seen as well as other debris. 
    This is made worse by the very regular cuts in the footage throughout the 
    time the ROVs are viewing the seabed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On cassette B40a/number 
    6 dated 4/12/94 the opening dialogue on both the screen and audio commentary 
    states that this is cassette two. Starting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and 
    featuring footage shot by the SPRINT ROV, no cassette has been received labelled 
    as number one or any timed recording before this time on this date.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a large 
    amount of repeat coverage of certain areas of the vessel without any new information, 
    procedure, agenda or evidence being discovered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On two of the cassettes 
    that have been supplied, the official tape logs that have been supplied as 
    documentation generated at the time of filming do not correspond with the 
    content of the video cassette.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has been confirmed 
    by the contractor used for the diver survey, Rockwater, that it is common 
    practice for divers to be equipped with two different earpieces to allow both 
    the dive supervisor and technical personnel to communicate with the diver. 
    It is apparent on the diver video B40c/ number 19 that the diver is receiving 
    instructions in another earpiece. It is unfortunate that these instructions 
    have apparently resulted in the missing of potentially important areas of 
    the vessel survey. There are no transcripts at all of any of these communications.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is evidence 
    indicating that there has been movement of the bow ramp at some point before 
    it came to rest in its current position. The evidence visible on the tapes 
    is the two hawsers trapped inside the car deck on the port side near the manual 
    side lock. The other evidence is on the starboard side where the visor actuator 
    has caused considerable damage on the front bulkhead, there is a large flap 
    of this metal caught between the ramp and the bulkhead and there is further 
    evidence on the starboard bulkhead recess in way of the blown up fastening 
    of the bow ramp actuator that the ramp had been opened/closed which it had 
    already been resting on the starboard bulkhead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40c/number 
    19 the divers have cut some items from the bow and are taking them to the 
    crane for lifting, one diver is at the upper port side of the ramp and the 
    other is at the bottom starboard side of the ramp. The diver who is standing 
    on the starboard side bottom of the bow ramp near the hinge turns his head 
    twice towards the seabed. On both occasions another diver is visible on the 
    starboard side of the ramp below him, this diver is wearing different equipment 
    from the two divers already detailed and is not explained in any of the other 
    footage.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the divers 
    are in the area of the port bridge there is a large amount of damage on the 
    under side of the port wing of the bridge which was - at least to some extent 
    - already visible on the ROV video from 02.10.94 and the sheeting appears 
    to be torn off the underside of the bridge wing with heavy scoring marks on 
    the inner side of the vertical stanchion supporting the wing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The lower outer 
    wire strengthened glass window of the backside of the port bridge wing was 
    also found to be broken trapping what appears to be a victim in the strengthening 
    wire still attached to the window. The diver first pulled the mash wire away 
    and then pulled the body out of the window and let it float away.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40d/number 
    9 the diver says that he is going to the seabed, but there is no tape showing 
    this part of the survey. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the time and 
    date order of the cassettes, tape B40e/number 10 chronologically comes before 
    tape B40d/number 9.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the ROV survey 
    conducted in 1996/number 11 the tape is dated from the official source as 
    19/06/96 but it is cut so badly that it goes back in time by whole days to 
    the 09/06/96, 26/04/96, 17/06/96, 11/06/96 and contains still images from 
    a video pause during duplication.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Disengage reached 
    the following conclusions: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a disturbing 
    lack of continuity in the cassettes due to the large number of tape cuts. 
    These tape cuts appear to have been made at different times and with different 
    levels of competence. The cuts vary between very clean, single frame cuts 
    with no interference on screen, to long pieces of interference and on several 
    occasions the contents not only change location but go back in time and date. 
    The worst example of this type of cut occurs on the most recent cassette from 
    1996 that jumps back in time nearly two months. Very few of the tape cuts 
    that have been documented in this report occur in locations where victims 
    could be or are located and they are not due to technical issues, leaving 
    no apparent reason for their existence. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The fact that the 
    tape cuts repeatedly occur in the same areas of the vessel on different cassettes 
    from different times and dates does not allow us to generate full documentation 
    of a very serious casualty. This is a particular concern as the areas that 
    lack documentation are very important to the investigation and include the 
    starboard mudline and car deck. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is wide range 
    of diver and ROV activity on and around the wreck site that is not detailed 
    in the available footage. The time comparisons detailed in this report illustrate 
    that the activity of some of the ROVs and divers visible on the tapes is not 
    documented in its own right due to lack of tapes or tape cuts. On several 
    occasions this undocumented activity is in areas where there is a lack of 
    overall documentation, including the car deck and bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Format problems 
    resulting in poor duplication and footage quality hamper independent investigation 
    of the official cassettes. The lack of format conversion during duplication 
    has resulted in a large drop in quality, combined with the tape cuts it has 
    meant that reaching conclusions from the tapes and still images has been far 
    more difficult, sometimes impossible. </font></li>

  <i>Investigation Report on Possible Explosion Damage on the Ferry "Estonia"</i><br>
  by Brian H.L. Braidwood, MBIM, MIExpE, Weymouth/UK</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">At the beginning 
    of this subchapter the Estonian managing director of Estline,</font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    Johannes Juhanson, shall be quoted when he told the Estonian media on 29.09.94:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»"Estonia" 
      was sunk by an abnormal factor, an explosion or an underwater collision.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In February 1999 
    Brian Braidwood was requested by this 'Group of Experts' to look into certain 
    aspects of the casualty in his capacity as diving and underwater explosives 
    expert, in particular to investigate whether explosive devices were present 
    on board the ESTONIA and had caused damage when they exploded before the sinking 
    of the ferry.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a very 
    careful investigation Brian Braidwood concentrated his attention on three 
    aspects, viz.:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a. The suspect 
      package found during underwater surveys by the port side of the bow ramp.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b. Damage 
      near the visor starboard side locks. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c. Damage 
      on the car deck at the port side forward.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After dealing with 
    each item in turn, he has drawn certain conclusions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These are:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a.<b> The suspect 
    package</b><br>
    It has been considered whether this suspect package could have been an explosive 
    device even if the sides of the cube were no longer than 100 mm - the smallest 
    estimate. A block of this size would indeed have enough space to hold all 
    the essential components of a small explosive charge of one to two kilograms.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finding such 
    a device near the side locks suggests an attempt to damage the ship at a particularly 
    vulnerable position. However, in later video surveys of the same area, the 
    package has disappeared. When or how the device got there must remain a matter 
    of conjecture. It can only be emphasised that the act of placing and arming 
    such a charge takes only a few seconds as the firing time will have been set 
    beforehand. A determined saboteur might well decide to increase his possibility 
    of success by placing more charges, at similar vulnerable points elsewhere 
    on the ship. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood 
    concludes that on a balance of probabilities the suspect package could have 
    been an explosive device containing between one and three kilograms of plastic 
    explosive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>b. Damage near 
    the visor starboard side locks</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Photos of the 
    visor tank on land, show that on the starboard side, the two metal plates 
    forming the hook for the manual side lock were severely distorted and folded 
    onto an overlapping position. The lug for the hydraulic side lock has been 
    ripped off the visor tearing away a flap of metal. The photos also show distinct 
    darkening of the white paint surface above the badly distorted hook for the 
    manual side lock. This marking looks like burn or scorch marks.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the port 
    side, however, the ends of the two metal plates forming the hook for the manual 
    side lock had only been pressed together. Also, the lug of the hydraulic side 
    lock had been ripped off where its welding has given way, but there was no 
    sign of burn marks anywhere on the port side. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are several 
    black and white photos and one composite picture made up of overlapping video 
    stills. This composite picture gives a dramatically clear impression of the 
    damage to the ship's bulkhead in the area of the side locks. This view of 
    the damaged area was taken from the forward side of the bulkhead looking aft. 
    The bottom half of the picture shows the opening for the manual side-lock 
    hooks. Above that is the hydraulic side-lock lug which was torn off the visor. 
    Above that again is a fresh hole in the metal. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Dealing with 
    the details from the bottom, the picture shows that the extreme lower end 
    of the manual side-lock opening is still in the shape of a smooth curve and 
    so is undamaged. However, within a very short distance, the metal has been 
    splayed out towards the camera. This is easier to see in the actual video.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the top 
    of the opening for the manual side lock, photos show damage to the bulkhead 
    in the immediate vicinity of the visor damage just described. In a colour 
    photo, the opening designed to receive the hook of the manual side lock, has 
    been enlarged by damage at its upper end and some pieces of metal may have 
    been completely displaced from the area. The manual side-lock securing mechanism 
    can been still inside the hole as it was never secured for the final voyage. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic 
    side-lock lug, which was ripped away from the visor, was lodged in its recess 
    on the starboard front bulkhead where it would normally be located when locked. 
    At the edges of the hole the metal seems to have split in all directions away 
    from the centre. this is all characteristic of the sea of an explosion.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Just above 
    this area there is a fresh hole which is made by a flap having been pushed 
    back in an S-shaped fold. It is a fairly round hole about 250 mm across. Some 
    of the metal has been pushed in, (away from the camera position). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A comparison with 
    the port side bulkhead showed no damage at all that might have been compatible 
    with an explosion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The circumstances 
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, 
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor 
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well 
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through 
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the 
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the 
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from 
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this 
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The marking 
    and damage suggests that if an explosive device was used it would have been 
    placed on the after side of the bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock 
    slot. This means that a device like the one described earlier would have remained 
    in place despite water flowing through the slot just below it. When it exploded, 
    it was probably completely surrounded by water, with the other side of the 
    bulkhead also flooded. This would have resulted in a strong shock wave through 
    the water reaching the nearby visor. However, the presence of water on both 
    sides of the bulkhead would have reduced the area of damage. The chock might 
    well have fractured the welds of the hydraulic side-lock lug, which was retained 
    in the bulkhead by its pin. The welds apparently tore out the triangular strip 
    of metal seen on the photo of the visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To sum it up, the 
    following damage has been described and illustrated in the area of the starboard 
    side lock: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and torn 
      metal damaged around the top part of the manual side-lock opening front 
      bulkhead. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of 
      this damaged metal has been pushed forward towards the visor.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Darkening 
      of the visor paintwork at exactly the same level as the damaged metal described.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The hydraulic 
      side-lock hooks just below the burn marks were pushed down and severely 
      distorted in a manner unlikely to have resulted from any mechanical impact.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On a balance of 
    probabilities Brian Braidwood has concluded that: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The damage near 
      the starboard visor side locks was caused by an explosion.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge 
      weight was between one and two kilograms of TNT equivalent.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explosive 
      device was placed on the forward bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock 
      recess.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the 
      crewman responsible for operating the manual side lock.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>c. Damage to 
    the car deck port side forward<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood 
    investigates damage in the port forward corner of the car deck, to establish 
    if it might have been caused by an explosion. The damage can been seen in 
    a short part of Video B40c which was taken by a diver. From the video it seems 
    that the diver may not even have been aware of this particular damage, or 
    else was told to look away and concentrate on other areas. The damage is only 
    visible when the camera and light, which the diver is wearing on his head, 
    are turned briefly to one side. There is no reference to the hole by either 
    the diver or his supervisor. Nevertheless, the relevant section of the video 
    has been studied in great detail to establish the possible cause of damage. 
    The image is seen most clearly when the video is played in very slow motion, 
    or even frame by frame, using specialist viewing equipment.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The videos 
    and still photos from around the port forward corner of the car deck show 
    a widespread presence of some sort of red or pink material. Some of it is 
    very shiny and reflects the diver's light. The material may be bedding. In 
    an case it seems to have been used to reduce the flow of water from the flooded 
    visor space past the edge of the raised bow ramp and into the car deck. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on estimates 
    from studying the video and still photos, the lower edge of the damage is 
    about 300 mm above the deck level and there is no apparent damage to the deck 
    itself. This suggest that the device may have been lying on something, perhaps 
    bedding, when it exploded. It could, therefore, have been placed in a higher 
    position and become dislodged by some physical impact in the immediate vicinity. 
    The forward edge of the damage is about 300 mm away from the forward edge 
    of the bulkhead.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Inside and 
    around the hole can be seen the red and pink colouring of the bedding. It 
    looks as if some of it was inside the adjacent compartment and can be seen 
    through the damage hole. The damage hole itself is fairly round and about 
    300 mm across.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hole is 
    bordered by petals of split metal which have split in all directions away 
    from the centre of the hole. The photos are taken looking at the bulkhead 
    from inside the car deck space and it can be seen how the petals cast strong 
    shadows onto the bulkhead. This clearly shows that the metal has been pushed 
    away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The circumstances 
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, 
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor 
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well 
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through 
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the 
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the 
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from 
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this 
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the device 
    exploded in the manual side-lock access compartment the space would have been 
    flooded. This means the device would have been surrounded by water with air 
    on the car deck side of the damaged bulkhead. However, from the comparatively 
    small extent of damage, it is unlikely that any device exploded in contact 
    with the bulkhead, and there is no way of knowing how far from the bulkhead 
    it might have been.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the following 
    circumstances were established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - A fairly round 
      damage hole in the port bulkhead of the car deck adjacent to the bow ramp.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and 
      torn metal petals around the edge of the hole.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of 
      the damaged metal pushed away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- That any 
      explosive device used could have been dislodged from a higher position and 
      fallen on some bedding in the compartment next to the car deck.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Any device 
      used would have been surrounded by water when it exploded. These points, 
      taken together, suggest that a small explosion occurred on the far side 
      of the bulkhead with the seat of the explosion being in the centre of the 
      damage hole.<br>
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On a balance of probabilities, 
    Brian Braidwood has concluded that:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The damage in 
      the car deck port side forward was caused by an explosion.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge 
      weight was between one and two kilograms of TNT equivalent. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explosive 
      device was placed inside the space used to give access to the visor side 
      locks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the 
      crewman responsible for securing the manual side locks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The seat 
      of the explosion was just above deck level as if the device had been resting 
      on something, perhaps a pile of blankets, before it went off.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      may be have been placed on the forward bulkhead like the one on the starboard 
      side, and been knocked off to fall onto some bedding before it exploded.</font></p>

    on the balance of probabilities:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1. The condition

      bulkhead on tearing away from its base plate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2. The lack of 
      damage to the starboard actuator means that the adjacent hole in the forward

      its base plate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3. The hole in

    <i>Defect and Failure Analysis of the Bow Visor Structure of the M. V. "Estonia"</i><br>
    by the Laboratory for Materials Technology and Welding<br>
    Techniques of the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a further consequence 
    of the finding that the Atlantic lock would only be exposed to excessive loads 
    if the visor hinges had partly or completely failed, the Laboratory for Materials 
    Technology and Welding Techniques of the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg 
    was instructed to examine the hinge remains which had meanwhile been cut off 
    the visor at Hangö and transported to the Royal Technical Institute (KTH), 
    Stockholm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The investigation 
    was subsequently extended to the connecting and supporting structural elements 
    between the visor and hull, i.e. in addition to the visor hinges also the 
    visor actuator mountings on D-deck, the side lock locations between visor 
    and hull, the Atlantic lock location between visor and hull and the visor 
    stempost area were examined. The investigations also included a visual examination 
    of the parts cut off the MARE BALTICUM ex DIANA II. The results of the difficult 
    and long lasting examinations, partly carried out at KTH, Stockholm, shall 
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(1) The visor 
    stempost </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welds between 
    stempost and shell plating of the visor had failed already during normal service 
    by a spectrum of cyclic loading providing tensile stress at the crack initiation 
    points together with long term corrosive action of seawater after opening 
    of the welds. As a consequence the stempost had not only been separated from 
    the shell plating during normal service but the stempost being a vital part 
    in its load-carrying function was in itself found to be split up into four 
    parts by crack development well before the casualty. The drawing on the next 
    page shows the cracks F1 - F4 of which F1 had penetrated the thickness of 
    the stempost to about 40% and blue paint was found inside the crack. It could 
    be verified that these traces of blue paint originated from penetration of 
    the outside paint into the crack opening at the time the crack had penetrated 
    the stempost already to the extent of about 40% of its thickness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Reference 
    is made to Section 12.5 where the application of ice paint INERTA is explained 
    in January 1994, when the ESTONIA had been in the shipyard for the last time, 
    thus at that time the stempost was already cracked by ca. 40%.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1189.jpg" width="517" height="352"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation 
    of fracture F1 - F4 ascertained that all the transverse fracture had started 
    and penetrated from the outside by corrosion assisted fatigue cracking. In 
    addition, fractures F2 and F3 reveal major bending displacements of their 
    flanks, in particular fracture F3 reveals a specific bending angle of about 
    70° combined with severe bending deformation following the original crack 
    development. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) The Atlantic 
    lock</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inspection 
    of the original lug remains recovered from the wreck of the ESTONIA at KTH, 
    Stockholm revealed that the failure of the Atlantic lock took place by rupture 
    of the 3 lugs welded to the forepeak deck of the ferry, viz. at first to their 
    circular welds to the housing/bushing, subsequently in the remaining cross 
    sections by overload shear at about 40° to the mounting plane on forepeak 
    deck, whereby also bending distortion prior to final cracking of the assembly 
    was found.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor mating 
    lug was found to be deformed by bending of about 15°-20° to starboard whereby 
    apparently a crack had opened in the weld between the visor bottom plating 
    and a vertical support stiffener.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bore of 
    this mating lug had an original diameter of 85 mm, however, which was measured 
    to be 91 x 105 mm with an oval deformation towards forward indicating the 
    main force direction to have been aft.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is a confirmation of the structural analysis of the visor by the FE method 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.2.430.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.2.430</a> - according to which the force direction at the Atlantic lock 
    was found to be <b>aft as long as the visor hinges were intact.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another downward 
    bending movement of about 8°-10° was found which indicated forward tilting 
    of the visor bottom prior to the failure of the lock.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is only possible if the hinges had failed already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further found 
    that the position and shape of the visor's mating lug did not fully comply 
    with the available drawings, thus changes had been made during the life of 
    the vessel. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Further examinations 
    revealed that about 90% of the length of welds between the lugs on the forepeak 
    deck and the bushing/housing had been pre-cracked by fatigue. The crack propagation 
    together with the corrosion showed a similar picture as found on the visor 
    stempost.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary 
    of the above it can be concluded that the welding seams between the lugs on 
    the forepeak deck and the bushing/housing as well as the welding seams between 
    when the visor lug and the visor bottom have been considerable pre-cracked 
    by fatigue.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Deformation 
    indicate a sideways and downwards movement of the visor during final failure 
    of the Atlantic lock.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(3) The side 
    locks</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    lug has been torn off the visor bulkhead in such a way that the crack started 
    at the upper edge of the weld between the lug and the visor plating, then 
    propagation in a downward direction, being inclined to starboard by about 
    20° against the vertical, leaving a steel tongue at an angle of more than 
    90° to the bulkhead surface before final separation of the lug from the visor 
    plating.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The port lug 
    location indicates a more vertical down tearing movement during crack propagation 
    without leaving a steel tongue before failure. No detailed investigation of 
    the character of the fractures have been performed nor were the welding seam 
    remains examined.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Actuator 
    mountings on B-deck</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    actuator was torn off from the supporting B-deck structure, whereby the welds 
    failed first and the vertical stiffeners below the B-deck plating subsequently, 
    leaving strongly deformed steel tongues behind. Inspection of the dismounted 
    port actuator revealed a repair weld in way of the vertical stiffener at a 
    location with possible high stress during the opening procedure. Investigation 
    revealed the fatigue cracked area to cover 50-70% of the total load-carrying 
    area of this weld.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(5) Actuator 
    hinges at the visor arms</b><br>
    At a distance of 1300 mm forward of the visor's main hinges the actuator hinges 
    (fastening) were fitted underneath the visor arms and permitted the actuators' 
    sideways movements up to an angle of 15°. No specific structural failures 
    could be found by visual inspection. Severe scratch marks were found with 
    complete removal of the paint at an angle of 8-10° against the horizontal. 
    At the linear forward edges of the lug plates deeper surface damage had been 
    caused as compared to the curved aft edges. It can be concluded that these 
    scratch marks are a result of the cutting process of the lug plates through 
    the forecastle deck plating. The scratch mark inclination of 8°-10° against 
    the visor arm would coincide with a forward rotation of the visor around the 
    Atlantic lock while the lug plates were cutting through the deck structure 
    and the side locks had failed already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(6) The visor 
    hinges</b><br>
    The visor's hinge system design consisted of the starboard and port side hinge 
    arms fabricated from structural platings, with two attached lug plates on 
    each side, carrying support bushings with bronze liners in the respective 
    bore holes. The support bushings were welded to the lug plates with circular 
    fillet welds. The visor hinge lugs were mated by deck hinge fittings, represented 
    by lugs welded to the forecastle deck. The mechanical connection was one bolt 
    on each side. The video image below shows the starboard hinge arm shortly 
    be- fore the accident.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following picture 
    shows the broken port visor lug plates with the frac-tures A1, A2, A5 and 
    A6. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The outer port side 
    shows a vertical to slightly horizontal bending to port side at the fracture 
    at the lower part of the remaining bore. The inner port side lug and both 
    starboard lugs - see picture below - did not exhibit significant bending deformations. 
    The picture below shows the broken starboard visor lug plates with fractures 
    A3, A4, A7, A8:</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1194.jpg" width="277" height="424"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The failure of the 
    visor hinges occurred by fractures A1-A8 of the visor lug plates together 
    with the fillet welds to the support bushings. The bolts had been ripped out 
    of the hinges, together with the bushings.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The four visor 
    lug plates revealed various amounts of macroscopic deformation and necking 
    at the fracture locations.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures 
    A1-A4 of the upper locations of the remaining bores were indicating considerable 
    less necking as compared to the lower fractures A5-A8. In particular, the 
    upper fractures A3,A4 of the starboard lugs exhibited only very small fracture 
    edge contractions, yielding substantially identical cross sections of the 
    fractures and the plates as taken from the design drawing. Fracture A4, shows 
    delaminations originating from longitudinally to rolling direction orientated 
    inclusions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The respective 
    upper fractures of the port side lugs A1, A2 showed visible necking with some 
    reduction of local cross sections. the lower fracture of the outer port side 
    lug A5, was considerable necked representing a typical shear failure.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lower fractures 
    A6 of both the inner port side and the outer starboard lug A8 were heavily 
    deformed by bending and hammering. As a particular feature, the inner starboard 
    upper fracture A3, was accompanied by numerous secondary cracks. Some of them 
    even penetrated the lug plate in radial direction without significant macroscopic 
    deformation.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visual 
    investigation of the failed fillet welds between the hinge lugs and the support 
    bushings revealed different cracking modes at the upper and lower fractures 
    of the hinge plates. Close to the upper hinge lug plate fractures, A1-A4, 
    the fillet welds had failed mostly by cracks parallel to either the hinge 
    or the bushing surface.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cracks 
    propagated also very often below the respective base material surfaces. At 
    the lower fracture areas of the hinge plates A5-A8, the fillet welds seemed 
    to have failed more by a shear fracture of the weld metal, revealing thicknesses 
    between 5 and 7 mm. However, there were also hammering effects on the weld 
    crack surfaces in this area which was more subjected to compression than to 
    tensile stress. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One bushing 
    had been recovered from the wreck while the remaining visor hinge lug plates 
    had been removed from the visor for investigation at the Institut för H&aring;llfasthetslära 
    of KTH, Stockholm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures 
    and cracks of the upper locations A1-A4 of both the starboard and port side 
    hinge lug plates exhibit ratchet marks and fatigue bench marks which demonstrate 
    the start of fatigue cracking from flame cutting marks in the inner bore of 
    the lugs. This applies also to the lower fracture of the inner starboard lug, 
    A8. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For further 
    identification of the cracking mechanism, a section was removed from the inner 
    starboard upper fracture A3 area containing the above mentioned secondary 
    cracks. As from the metallographic investigation, fig. 46, the cracks developed 
    stepwise and showed side branching with corrosion products being typical for 
    corrosion supported cracking.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The investigation 
    of one of the secondary cracks (A3) revealed numerous smaller secondary cracks 
    also starting from the inner asymmetrically applied deep flame cuts. The formation 
    of respective ratchet marks can be clearly demonstrated at the crack initiation 
    points, which show successive striation marks at various locations of the 
    secondary cracks being created by stepwise crack propagation in radial direction 
    of the visor hinges.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fatigue 
    cracks of the visor hinge plates did however also initiate from the outer 
    surface of the hinge plates. The inner bore holes of the hinge plates were 
    originally drilled by machining, however, the surfaces visible outside of 
    these areas were noted as having been destroyed by inadequate application 
    of flame cutting.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fracture 
    of the recovered hinge bushing was fitting to the fracture of the inner starboard 
    hinge lug. It exhibits a gap of about 4-6 mm between lug bore and support 
    bushing. This gap is almost entirely filled with corrosion products, presumably 
    magnetite, which is also found in thick layers at a location where both hinge 
    late and fillet weld failure are represented together with some excess weld 
    metal, see arrow on the picture below which may have provided a local notch 
    effect.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1197.jpg" width="308" height="244"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In another cross 
    section, also severe corrosion inside the gap is identified and the surface 
    of the hinge bore and the bushing exhibit a considerable misalignment, which, 
    during welding of the left fillet weld, was overcome by a buffering layer. 
    The misalignment corresponds to asymmetric burning marks, for example of the 
    inner starboard hinge.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For closer 
    investigation only a small part of an adhering fillet weld of the support 
    bushing was available. It included both a full crack of the hinge plate material 
    and a secondary crack close to the weld metal and showed also the flame cut 
    surface of the hinge plate bore hole. While the full crack revealed plastic 
    shear at its flanks, the secondary crack had started from the heat affected 
    flame cut surface and propagated close to the heat affected zone of the weld 
    in radial direction. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the 
    evidence provided by the above investigation, the following conclusions can 
    be drawn:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The fillet welds 
      between the hinge plates and the bushings seem to have partially failed 
      a considerable time before the casualty due to corrosion supported fatigue.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The partial 
      failure of these fillet welds provided access of seawater to the gap between 
      the hinge plates and the bushings and caused reduction of load carrying 
      capacity of the hinges. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Both effects 
      facilitated the start and propagation of extensive corrosion fatigue cracking 
      of the hinge plates at another location which occurred also a considerable 
      time before the casualty as demonstrated by the corroded appearance of the 
      fracture of the inner starboard hinge.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It has 
      to be assumed that the inner starboard hinge may have failed first with 
      only a small macroscopic plastic deformation at the edges of the fracture 
      and without leaving bending of the rest of the hinge plate.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As the 
      port inner hinge plate was found to be bent to port and plastic necking 
      at the fracture was noted, it has to be assumed that the port hinges failed 
      after the starboard hinges. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above explained 
    investigation of the various parts of the ESTONIA visor system has provided 
    sufficient evidence that the visor hinges, in particular, the starboard hinge 
    lugs, were severely precracked, before the casualty. There is also evidence 
    that the fillet welds between the visor hinge lugs and the support bushings 
    failed due to corrosion assisted fatigue.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to 
    determine the required strength assessments, a Finite Element Calculation 
    of the stresses in the above welds was carried out which considered four different 
    directions of loads on the hinge lugs and established the location of the 
    maximum fracture inducing radial stresses in the fillet welds for each direction 
    and for various applied loads. The thickness of the fillet welds were taken 
    as 7 mm.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For example, 
    the normal visor opening procedure created a vertical down force of maximum 
    375 kN on each hinge lug based on nominal visor weight and respective leverages 
    and resulted in maximum radial stress in the fillet weld found at the location 
    as marked by the circle in the drawing below together with the stress distribution 
    in radial direction. Accordingly the opening procedure would thus create a 
    local radial weld joint stress of 75 N/mm². </font></p>

    </font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is thus obvious 
    that, during opening of the visor, the location of maximum radial fillet weld 
    stress is found in the same region where fatigue cracking of those fillet 
    welds initiated. However, also the other assumed directions of loads on the 
    visor hinges would provide maximum radial stress locations. In particular, 
    a similar stress range as for the opening procedure would result from an assumed 
    aftwards force on the hinges. Such an aftwards load could have created the 
    conditions for crack initiation and failure of the hinge plates, following 
    the failure of the fillet.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the present 
    investigation the following conclusions are drawn: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The ESTONIA bow 
      visor system contained considerable amounts of fatigue cracking which was 
      created by dynamic loads during normal service. The visor hinges showed 
      the largest amount of pre-damage, together with the mountings of the hydraulic 
      actuators.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure 
      of the bow visor hinges was initiated by failure of the fillet welds which 
      were vital supporting joints between the visor hinge plates and the supporting 
      bushings.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure 
      of the hinge fillet welds at locations of high stress was initiated by corrosion 
      fatigue a considerable time before the casualty.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The dynamically 
      loaded hinge plates failed by fatigue cracking and subsequent plastic overloading 
      of the remaining weakened cross sections. The fatigue crack initiation at 
      the hinge plates was favourised by corrosion, reduced load-carrying capacity 
      and burning marks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In addition 
      to the visor hinges and the actuator mountings, there were various other 
      pre-damaged locations, in particular, the stempost and the bottom lock area, 
      which may have contributed to overloading of the hinge locations. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the evening of 
    17.09.94, i.e. 10 days before ESTONIA's last departure from Tallinn, a Swedish 
    passenger was standing on the forward open part of deck 7 and filmed the closing 
    of the visor, the handling of the mooring lines by the deck crew and, finally, 
    he zoomed in on the starboard visor hinges. The first copy of the original 
    film was made available to this 'Group of Experts' and a first internal analysis 
    revealed that the starboard visor hinge was in an absolutely disastrous condition 
    as can be seen on the image below. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The results are 
    summarised in the<i> Report on the Loss of the Ro-Ro Ferry "Estonia"</i> - 
    attached as Enclosure 12.5.180 and shall be briefly commented as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The object of the 
    report was to detect and identify any structural rupture or damage which could 
    have contributed to the loss of the Ro-Ro ferry ESTONIA. For identification 
    of components bracketed numbers, for example (5) in the text refer to annotations 
    on the drawings, on the previous page. A detailed examination of the video 
    tape showed the only damage to be identified limited to the starboard visor 
    hinge.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inner visor 
    hinge plate (2) is correct and straight on its fore and aft axis other than 
    a section of approximately 150 mm between the vertical centre line of bolt 
    (10) and the aft end of the visor arm (1). This section has a clockwise twist 
    which gives a downward inclination to the visor bolt (10) and the inner steel 
    bushing surrounding it (7). This inclination of the bolt assembly (10) and 
    the steel bushing extends from its inner end to the outer face of the vessel 
    hinge plate (5). The video image does not allow a precise calculation of this 
    angle, but the average of a series of measurements show it to be approximately 
    4 degrees which gives a downward misalignment of the axis at bolt(10) of approximately 
    25 mm at the starboard face of the vessel's outer hinge plate (5). In addition 
    there are two unexplained dark marks on each side of the inner hinge plate 
    (2) opposite each other at the point it joins the bolt assembly (10). These 
    two marks appear to be joined by a thin line extending across this section 
    of the inner Visor Hinge Plate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An aft section of 
    approximately 400 mm of the outer visor hinge plate (3) together with the 
    outer steel bushing it carries has a significant rotation in an anti clockwise 
    direction on its fore and aft axis. The whole assembly is visibly rotated 
    to such an extent that both its inner and outer ends can be seen on the video 
    image as an ellipse. This is in marked contrast to the inner bushing assembly 
    (7) which is symmetrical to the axis of the bolt (10) as seen in Makers drawings 
    590/1106. There is another disruption to the bolt assembly, i.e. the outer 
    steel bushing (8) is shown on the hinge plate (3) while the video print shows 
    it to be misplaced outwards by approximately 80 mm. The steel bushing (8) 
    extends further than the portion on the inner side of the outer visor arm 
    although it should be identical as seen on Drawing 590/1106. Taking account 
    of all these situations it is apparent that considerable disturbances have 
    taken place in this area. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the video 
    image a significant linear difference is apparent along the axis of bolt (10) 
    at its interfaces with outer steel and bronze bushing at the outer side of 
    the vessel hinge plate (5). In this area the video image shows a significant 
    fact. The base of the outer visor arm casing (1) can be clearly seen at deck 
    level and can also be seen in a gap of approximately 25 mm between the vessel's 
    outer hinge plate (5) and the outer steel bushing (8). According to Makers 
    Drawing this should not be possible, as the bushing (8) should obstruct this 
    view. In addition to this nothing can be seen of the fixed bushing (6) beyond 
    the face of the outer vessel hinge plate (5) from which it should protrude 
    by 5 mm nor can the 5 mm distance ring which should be between the outer hinge 
    plate and the outer steel bushing. There is a further significant fact, approximately 
    150/160 degrees for the bronze and steel bushing (8) is missing from the lower 
    section of the Bolt Assembly (10). From the video image it is clearly visible 
    that the securing plate (9) is totally missing and that the bolt (8) is not 
    in place where it should be, and that only 2 of the 4 securing plate bolts 
    (11) are in position and are sticking out of the outer steel bushing (8). 
    These are either studs from which the nuts have been forced off or bolts nuts 
    with the heads broken off.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary the following 
    has to be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This Report is based 
    on Video Tape Images showing disruption to the structure of the Ferry "Estonia", 
    especially in the area of the Starboard Hinge Plates (2) and (3), and on the 
    Bolt Axis (10). This damage is very significant, especially so when the components 
    involved form part of a load bearing assembly liable to operate in heavy sea 
    conditions. </font></p>

    Structure Analysis of the Bow Ramp Hinges<br>
    by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has stated 
    on page 175 of their Final Report:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»After the 
      ramp had been forced open by the visor, waves may have caused the ramp to 
      move between fully open and partly closed position, but generally a significant 
      opening was available for waves to enter the car deck as further described 
      in 13.5 below. The large amounts of water flooding onto the car deck caused 
      the vessel to heel over and after a few rolling movements a significant 
      list developed to starboard. This happened within the first minutes after 
      the visor had separated from the ship. It is, however, the opinion of the 
      Commission that full service speed setting was maintained right up to the 
      time when the list developed.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    according to the JAIC the bow ramp had been fully open for some time when 
    the vessel was still on full service speed at a significant wave height of 
    between 3.5 - 4.5 m, which included the 7 m wave, from about 30° on the port 
    bow. <br>
    Therefore the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg was requested to calculate 
    the water column necessary to break all four intact hinges of the bow ramp. 
    The result was that <b>a static load corresponding to 6 m water </b>- but 
    without the influence of about 14 kn speed - would break all four sound hinges<b>. 
    As the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle already at around midnight, 
    it can be excluded that the bow ramp would have remained connected to the 
    vessel by the hinges</b> in particular if the vessel was making a speed of 
    about 14 kn against bow seas.<br>
    As explained in the previous Subchapters 6.5, 12.4 and 12.5, however, the 
    severely pre-damaged <b>port outer hinge </b>of the bow ramp<b> had collapsed 
    </b>presumably already in March 1994 and the ramp became detached from the 
    vessel and most probably subsequently <b>also the port inner hinge</b> broke, 
    leaving the <b>starboard inner and outer hinges.<br>
    </b>Calculations of the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg have revealed 
    that in case the ramp was just connected to the vessel by the port inner, 
    the starboard inner and the starboard outer hinges a <b>static load of 4 m 
    water</b> would have been sufficient to break off the ramp not taking into 
    account <b>the additional effect of a speed of 14 kn,</b> and if the ramp 
    <b>had been connected just by the starboard inner and outer hinges</b> - which 
    was the most likely scenario - a static load of only 2.5 m is required to 
    break off the ramp, again, not considering the effect of the speed.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As it has been 
    proved with certainty - Subchapter 12.4 - that the port outer bow ramp hinge 
    was broken and the ramp detached from the vessel many months before the casualty, 
    which was confirmed by the damage picture of the ramp after the casualty, 
    it can be concluded that the bow ramp would have broken off completely had 
    it been fully open shipping water with a significant wave height of between 
    3.5 - 4.5 m (7 m) on the port bow and with the vessel making a speed of about 
    14 kn. <br>

    that it has theoretically been possible for the lugs underneath the visor 
    arms to break through the deckbeam at frame 159. It has not been the subject 
    of this investigation to determine whether breaking through the deckbeam is 
    reflected in the damage picture of the lugs underneath the visor arms. The

        The commission has finalized the taking of statements from the survivors. 
        On Friday they concentrated on collecting all thinkable information which 
        might have a relation to the casualty. There is eyewitness evidence drawing 
        the investigators' attention to the bow door. However Lethola does not 
        exclude completely the possibility that the cargo might have shifted. 
        "The many reports about banging noises from the car deck could indicate 
        that the cargo did move", Lethola replied. <br>
        The Swedish and Estonian parts of the commission have gone home and the 
        commission shall first collect everything concrete to work with. <br>
        "Now our work aims at filming the wreck. With the help of the video films 
        we hope to be able to analyse and draw conclusions about the casualty", 
        said Olof Forssberg. "Further investigations are required before we take 
        position concerning possible diving." A preliminary report might come 
        within a week after the JAIC has studied the video films .... . "<br>

        most likely that also he lost his life. The commission has a special interest

        The vessel may have deviated from her normal course and may have had problems

        so much mistrust against the Estonian crew and the Estonian JAIC members

        Sonar images of the wreck of the 'Estonia' last night suggested the ferry 
        may have sustained catastrophic damage to her bow doors. Pictures transmitted 
        to the Finnish government vessel "HALLI" from an unmanned submersible 
        suggested the visor bow door was lying 15 m from the hull. The underwater 
        survey tended to confirm fears that the failure of the outer visor may 
        have caused the casualty. There was still no indication as to whether 
        there had also been a devastating failure of the inner watertight doors."

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Turku on 
      this and the following day and viewed the video material produced by the 
      ROVs from the "HALLI". It has to be assumed that it was then decided that 
      the visor had to be considered "not yet found", although somebody must have 
      told Lloyd's List before that the visor had been found. The reasons for 
      such a tactical manoeuvre are obvious: The visor next to the wreck implies 
      a longer sequence of events and rules out a rapid development undetected 
      by the crew until it was too late. The visor close to the wreck also rules 
      out the possibility that the visor might have pulled open the bow ramp when 
      the vessel was still at full speed or, at least, making headway. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Film Pictures 
        Show the Visor to Have Been Torn Off </b><br>
        Video pictures show that the whole visor was torn off 'Estonia' ... and 
        that the watertight ramp at its inside was about 1 m open. Therefore the 
        car deck became quickly water-filled and the vessel capsized. .... The 
        experts cannot say whether a heavy wave or fatigue of the material have 
        caused the catastrophe. The video pictures demon-strate without doubt 
        that is possible on a modern ferry that the whole visor weighing many 
        tons can simply be torn off. This could be the explanation for the 2 bangs 
        many survivors have heard. ...<br>
        The visor was pushed upwards with such force that it broke loose from 
        its hydraulic locking devices and left big holes in the steel plates. 
        ... <br>
        The visor has still not been found although ROVs have been used in addition. 
        The reason for this is certainly that the visor fell off more than on 
        hour before the vessel sank. The bow ramp is in position but its locking 
        devices are also damaged. The bow ramp has to ascertain/maintain watertightness 
        even if the visor is damaged, however, it is about 1 m open. The JAIC 
        draws the conclusion that the water quantities which ingressed through 
        the open ramp were sufficient for the vessel to loose the stability and 
        to capsize. <br>
        Why the visor was torn off and why also the locking devices of the bow 
        ramp are damaged the JAIC cannot say for the time being. "We need time 
        for us to find the answers why the visor became loose", said Olof Forssberg. 
        According to Forssberg this could be for example a heavy wave, too high 
        speed under the prevailing conditions and too high load.<br>
        The JAIC members warned not to draw conclusions with regard to other car/passenger 
        ferries. They would now investigate whether the 'Estonia's' construction 
        would deviate from the construction of other comparable ferries. According 
        to naval architect Börje Stenström, JAIC member, it is already clear that 
        the ferry traffic shall have to face serious consequences even if the 
        answer to the question what caused the casualty should not be found. <br>
        "It has to be emphasized that the Atlantic lock of the 'Estonia', which 
        is an additional locking device for heavy weather, had been engaged," 
        said Stenström. <br>
        Failure of Material Far-fetched <br>
        Stenström does not want to speculate completely about the causes why the 
        lock mechanism failed, however, he stated that failure of the material 
        seemed to be far-fetched. "Then you may rather imagine overload." <br>
        Technology Doctor T. Karppinen ... stated that the sea state had influenced 
        the tearing off of the visor. According to Karppinen the pictures of the 
        open bow ramp did support the reports of two engineers that water ingressed 
        through the bow ramp. That they had seen on a monitor."</i></font></p>

        Supports Video Film </b><br>
        Six days after the catastrophe the only surviving officer having been 
        on duty spoke at a press conference in Tallinn. The 3rd engineer and watch-keeper 
        Margus Treu was in the engine room of the vessel at the time of the casualty. 
        In the case that his evidence is true it is once and forever established 
        that "Estonia's" sinking was caused by the tearing loose of the bow visor. 
        <br>
        In spite of Treu being an experienced sailor it was difficult for him 
        to explain what actually happened. <br>
        - "At 01.00 hrs. I saw on my monitor in the engine room that an AB sailor 
        went his control round and that he was just forward at the bow ramp." 
        <br>
        This information, however, does not conform with the statement that AB 
        sailor Silver Linde made during earlier interrogation by the Commission. 
        Linde testified there that he had completed his round already at 00.30 
        hrs. by turning a control key behind the bow ramp. <br>
        <b>Heard Hard Bangs</b> <br>
        Between 01.12 and 01.15 Margus Treu heard 2 to 3 strong bangs in the vessel. 
        <br>
        "These were not the waves. They did not sound like from waves even if 
        the waves are very strong. I thought that trucks had started to move and 
        crashed against the shell plating." <br>
        He switched his monitor to the effect that he could see the truck. Thereafter 
        he changed the camera and had a look at the bow area. "There I saw that 
        water rushed onto the car deck. Then the vessel had already taken a list. 
        Simultaneously the mate called from the bridge asking: "Can we restore 
        the balance of the vessel again?" Treu tried to pump water over to the 
        other side which failed. The mate asked again: <br>
        "Is it possible to pump out freshwater to regain the balance?" Treu replied: 
        <br>
        "This is not possible, this is technically impossible." <br>
        <b>The Engines Were Running </b><br>
        He also denied information that the engines had stopped long before the 
        vessel sank. No water entered the engine room as long as he was there.<br>
        "At 01.25 hrs. I tried to start the port one but it failed. The starboard 
        engines kept running for some minutes more. Then they also stopped." <br>
        <b>Washed into the Sea</b><br>
        Thereafter he crept up to the 8th deck and pulled himself to the aft just 
        when the sinking was interrupted.<br>
        - "Then I was washed into the sea by a giant wave. I succeeded in pulling 
        myself up into a lifeboat."<br>
        From there he saw that the bow visor had disappeared when "Estonia" disappeared 
        into the deep. <br>
        <b>After the press conference Margus Treu criticised the interrogations

        problem with the bow visor already before departure from Tallinn harbour. 
        Such a theory can be found in the investigation material of the Tallinn 
        police according to the experience of SvD made in Tallinn.</i></b><i> 
        However according to mate Einar Kukk, who was trainee onboard the 'Estonia', 
        those in command on the bridge did not receive any information that this 
        should have been the case. Kukk was on the bridge between 20.20 hrs. and 
        00.40 hrs. local time. "During this time a possible failure of the visor 
        was not discussed", said Einar Kukk to SvD. The Tallinn police have interrogated 
        58 survivors, of whom 33 are crew members. Many of them state that they 
        heard a distinct metallic noise before 'Estonia' got the list. "But none 
        of them took the view that this resulted from a collision", said the investigator 
        Väino Karmi. The investigation by the police, which runs parallel with 
        the investigations by the International Commission and the Swedish police, 
        indicates that the theory about sabotage can be probably written off. 
        "No such information did come up", said V. Karmi. He is upset about accusations 
        that the Estonian security police did try to hide important witnesses. 
        "When the survivors of the catastrophe arrived at Tallinn Airport we guided 
        them away from the intensive shadowing by the media. Even you journalists 
        have to understand that people having just escaped a tragedy should not 
        be exposed to questions." <br>
        <b>Fraud with Cargo Weights </b><br>
        Väino Karmi is well acquainted with MV 'Estonia' since the Tallinn police 
        initiated an investigation into fraud with cargo weights earlier this 
        year. The trigger off factor was the smuggling of 64 Kurds who were hidden 
        in a Swedish truck. Karmi is of the opinion that many freight forwarders 
        systematically stated lower values to avoid high customs fees. "Each time 
        the Estonian customs made spot checks they found wrong declarations." 
        SvD did scrutinise the "Estonia's" cargo manifest. The 39 trucks contained 
        everything from furniture and timber to frozen fish and fashion clothes. 
        Two trucks were declared empty, but the Tallinn police has no confirmation 
        of some rumours that refugees should have been onboard. <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There were actually 40 trucks onboard. <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">See 
        Chapter 17</a>. <br>
        <b>Trainee Mate </b><br>
        Mate Einar Kukk was onboard the 'Estonia' to gain practical experience 
        before taking up his normal duty as 2nd mate on "Estonia's" sister vessel 
        'Vironia,' the previous 'Diana II'. 'Vironia' shall take up the traffic 
        at the beginning of November. Kukk reports about the last hours onboard: 
        <br>
        - "I left the bridge at 00.40 hrs. Then everything was under control. 
        I went to bed just before 01.00 hrs. After ca. 5 minutes I heard a strange 
        noise which I had never heard before at sea." <br>
        Kukk went up to see what happened. When he was still in his cabin the 
        vessel started to heel over seriously. Kukk's statements also indicates 
        that 'Estonia' took a list already 30-35 minutes before the casualty.

        Criticised by the JAIC "</i></b><i><br>
        After the visor broke off the 'Estonia' was doomed if the vessel was not 
        turned rather quickly which was not done." That's the way Tuomo Karppinen 
        expressed himself. The JAIC came out with a preliminary report about what 
        caused the casualty after their meeting in Turku on Tuesday. <br>
        According to the JAIC the casualty one week ago had been caused by water 
        on the car deck which ingressed via the forward ramp. Why the visor broke 
        loose is not explained. The JAIC declared that it could have been caused 
        by fatigue as well as by one single overload of the locking devices. Thereafter 
        the visor broke off and the inner bow ramp was exposed to such wave loads 
        that the locking devices gradually gave way and the ramp opened some meters. 
        <br>
        This had been sufficient to take in so much water on to the car deck that 
        the vessel became unstable, heeled to starboard and capsized. How fast 
        this developed after the visor broke off the JAIC is unable to say.<br>
        <b>One A4 Page</b><br>
        It is also unknown "which information about the immediate danger did exist 
        on the bridge", as they expressed themselves. One A4 page with short factual 
        comments is all that the JAIC has achieved so far in the investigation 
        of the human tragedy without comparison in Europe after the war. <br>
        Many of the experts and members of the JAIC to whom DN spoke did agree 
        in one matter: It is considered to be more or less impossible that ferry 
        proceeded on against the prevailing sea conditions with the 15000 ts heavy 
        ferry without noting that the visor and also parts of the foreship were 
        torn/broken off. <br>
        "They should have seen from the bridge that the visor had disappeared", 
        said T. Karppinen. <br>
        "It is for me not understandable that one can proceed against 8-10 m high 
        waves without noting that the visor has disappeared", said Sten Anderson 
        who has sailed as master for 17 years and is now observer for Sjöfartsverket 
        to the JAIC. <br>
        "It is very difficult to understand that they proceeded on without visor 
        for another hour", said Börje Stenström. <br>
        All these comments mean subliminally that those in charge on the bridge 
        after midnight were not competent. Another possibility is that the visor 
        was torn off and the inner ramp damaged by one single wave which did not 
        give the watch officer time to react. <br>
        <b>Different Versions</b><br>
        The statements from the surviving crew members, however, do not confirm 
        the above version of a development within seconds after which the vessel 
        was doomed to capsize. The JAIC's hearing of the crew did clearly reveal 
        that the watch A.B. Silver Linde made his last watch round at 23.30 hours 
        Swedish time. At this time he had turned a key which confirms that he 
        did make his round. Then he heard a loud bang from the ramp and had to 
        hold himself fast not to be knocked off his feet on the car deck. He did 
        nevertheless not draw the conclusion that something dangerous had occurred 
        as the vessel continued to pitch in the heavy seas. Exactly this indicates 
        that what Linde heard was a part of the casualty scenario: He was used 
        from many times before to holding himself against the vessel's move-ments 
        and would not have paid attention unless something special occurred. <br>
        <b>"Everything normal". </b><br>
        When he came to the bridge half an hour later there were the 2nd and the 
        4th mate. At the same time also Captain Arvo Andresson appeared. According 
        to Linde everything was normal on the bridge. Thereafter the phone rang 
        and somebody advised that there was something wrong down in the vessel. 
        Apparently now large quantities of water were penetrating. <br>
        Only 24 minutes after Linde and the master came up to the bridge the emergency 
        call "Mayday" was sent. About 20 minutes later the vessel disappeared 
        from the radar screen of "Mariella". If the heavy bang heard by Silver 
        Linde on the car deck at 23.30 hrs. had been caused by the breaking off 
        of the visor, the vessel must have proceeded on for at least half an hour 
        without bow visor and also without those on the bridge noting what had 
        happened. Ab-solutely clear is that the master really tried to save his 
        vessel after he understood what had happened, it is however unclear when 
        this was. <br>
        - The pictures from the wreck show that the rudders are almost on hard 
        astarboard and the propellers are in a position indicating that the speed 
        had been reduced, said Tuomo Karppinen. It is, however, unclear when this 
        manoeuvre was made and how long the speed had been reduced. Sten Andersson 
        pointed to the fact that the reducing of speed in the prevailing wind 
        and sea conditions was the only professional way to handle the vessel. 
        <br>
        - However none of the surviving crew members from the engine room talk 
        about speed reduction for any longer period of time. It is extremely important 
        to adjust the speed, this is of particular importance for a vessel with 
        bow visor. According to Sten Andersson the crew "did not judge the circum-stances 
        properly" during that night. Karl-Johan Hagman drew attention to the fact 
        that Estonian vessels with 'Estonia's' engine power are unusual.<br>
        - The crew probably did not realize how dangerous it is to proceed with 
        full output of 24000 hp against the heavy waves, an output that was needed 
        to break half meter thick ice. <br>
        If the visor should be found near the wreck everything points to a very 
        quick development. The visor then broke loose shortly before the vessel 
        took such a list that all 4 main engines stopped due to lack of oil pressure. 
        <br>
        If, however, the visor should be found a longer distance away from the 
        wreck, this would indicate that the vessel proceeded for some time against 
        the heavy waves without visor. The competence of the crew has to be questioned. 
        Then the JAIC's chairman, the <b>Estonian Andi Meister</b>, does not believe 
        anything of this at all:<br>
        <b>- According to my opinion the catastrophe was caused by a material 
        failure. "I cannot blame the crew".</b><br>
        </i><b>Note:</b> When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe on 01.05.97 Andi 
        Meister stated among other things that "the JAIC had decided to use this 
        casualty to set an example by teach-ing the shipbuilding industry a lesson." 
        This required a casualty scenario permitting a cause consideration pointing 
        to the shipbuilder, i.e. the building yard - Meyer Werft in Papenburg.

        the forward ramp. <br>
        3. It was established that the bow visor was lost at a certain time. The 
        bottom lock has been identified by ROV. The lock turned out to be broken. 
        It could not be established however whether the failure had been caused 
        by fatigue or overload.<br>
        4. After the visor had fallen off, the inner ramp was exposed to the pressure 
        devices of the ramp to fail in steps and the ramp did open to some extent. 
        Thereby water could penetrate the car deck. It could not be verified whether 
        the locks of the ramp were out of function, i.e. were damaged or whether 
        the ramp moved forward out of a locked position. It has not been possible 
        to clarify whether the damages to the hull in consequence of the tearing 
        off of the visor did cause further leakages. <br>

        The highest police management is disappointed that no better assistance 
        is provided by the Swedish police and other autho-rities. Finland, however, 
        has supported the Estonians on different occasions already without the 
        Estonians having to beg for it. <br>

        office of the KGB had been. <br>
        <b>Difficult to get Information </b><br>
        - It has been difficult to obtain information from Sweden and the Swedish 
        police did not get in contact with us up till now. The Finnish police, 
        however, have been much more active, said Priit Männik. The information 
        he is lacking deals among other things with the passengers who had been 
        on board and who were delivered into Swedish hospitals, with 'Estonia's' 
        technical equipment and with information from the Swedish Shipping Inspection 
        (Sjöfartsverket). <br>
        - We have no access to the Swedish inspection made before the last departure 
        here in Tallinn on 27 September in connection with the training of Estonian 
        inspectors, he said. Transport Minister Andi Meister, chairman of the 
        JAIC, criticised for not having allowed the first hearing of survivors 
        to be performed the way required, said on Wednesday that the Estonians 
        had still not been informed who is in Swedish hospitals although many 
        days have passed since the 'Estonia' casualty. <br>
        <b>Invitation to the Swedish Police</b><br>
        Police chief Männik would like the Swedish police to come to Tallinn and 
        participate in the investigation. He and his investigators have now taken 
        the statements of all 61 Estonian survivors. On Wednes-day they commenced 
        analysing the statements. They are working in accordance with 3 main theories 
        why 'Estonia' could have sank, but Priit Männik is like a clam if he is 
        asked questions in this regard.<br>
        - I have agreed with the JAIC not to go public before their preliminary 
        results are clear. The technical aspects have to be carefully considered 
        in our investigation. Estonia has so far not put forward any suspicion 
        for a criminal offence. <br>
        - According to Männik the witness statements from the surviving Estonians 
        are very contradictory. One of the problems is to find the time when what 
        happened.<br>
        - He sighs about the confusion which continues to exist about who had 
        really been onboard of the 'Estonia' and refuses to state any number:

      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Damage to Visor 
        Locks is the Main Question </b><br>
        The JAIC is now focusing on the question whether the locking device systems 
        holding visor and bow ramp in place were faulty or damaged.<br>
        "This is one of the main questions we are concentrating upon", said Uno 
        Laur. As soon as the weather permits the 'Suunta' shall send the ROV's 
        down again, this time for a special documentation of the locking devices. 
        The combination of the broken off visor and the open ramp confuse the 
        experts, simultaneously it does point to the locking systems being a weak 
        point in the sequence-of-events. <br>
        "The visor broke off completely or in parts which could have been caused 
        by damaged locks. Thereafter huge water quantities were smashing against 
        the bow ramp, the inner door. This has to be watertight and has strong 
        hydraulic locks.<br>
        According to Johannes Palmgren, expert in Shipinspec., the ramp should 
        withstand the waves, even if the visor should be gone - at least for the 
        time it takes the crew to realize that the visor has disappeared.<br>
        The videos from the sea bottom show that the ramp is about 1 m wide open 
        at the upper side. The gap continues at both sides and narrows continuously. 
        <br>
        "Nowhere do you find an answer to the question why different locking systems 
        failed almost simultaneously", said Uno Laur. On Thursday the experts 
        of the Estonian part of the JAIC com-menced looking at the 16 hours of 
        video film available. SvD received permission to join the marine experts 
        while viewing the videos. <br>
        <b>Sharp pictures.</b><br>
        Remarkably sharp pictures from 'Estonia's' propeller triggered off an 
        intensive discussion. The question what speed was she making on her way 
        to disaster is most relevant. The 15 kn which were the rule in heavy weather 
        could have been too much. Nevertheless, what happened after the crew discovered 
        free floating water on the car deck? <br>
        Was the speed reduced to minimize the water ingress or did it come too 
        late? <br>
        "There are relations between the angles of the propeller blades which 
        indicate the speed of 'Estonia' just before she sank. On the film a rather 
        small angle is visible which indicates rather low speed", said Uno Laur. 
        <br>
        However the picture of the propellers do not say anything about the earlier 
        speed. <b>Most important: Did they lower the speed after 3rd engineer 
        Margus Treu had reported to the bridge that there was water on the car 
        deck just after midnight (Swedish time), i.e. 35-40 minutes before 'Estonia' 
        sank? <br>
        The Angle Controls the Speed.</b> <br>
        - Those in charge on the bridge can reduce the speed directly by changing 
        the angles of the propellers (blades). The engineer has nothing to do. 
        The four main engines can continue with unchanged revolutions, Laur pointed 
        out. It is nowhere documented that those in charge on the bridge actually 
        did reduce the speed after Treu's alarming them, said Laur. The combination 
        of the damaged or torn off visor, open ramp and excessive speed might 
        have been the death sentence for 'Estonia'. <br>
        <b>No Questions from the Owners </b><br>
        The Estonian part of the JAIC, of which Uno Laur is the member directly 
        representing the President has difficulties receiving the required information 
        quickly which is probably due to the politicians trying to influence the 
        investigation heavily. Already on the 29th September they requested drawings, 
        sketches and calculations for different parts of the 'Estonia'. <br>
        After six days, yesterday was Thursday, there was still no reaction. From 
        B.V. the JAIC received a letter on Thursday with the offer to help. The 
        letter was sent by normal mail and was thus only received after 6 days.<br>
        Finally fax contact has been established with Paris and the Estonians 
        have requested all relevant information from the classification society 
        B.V., which surveyed 'Estonia' in the beginning of 1993, which included 
        also the visor and the bow ramp. <br>
        "They are frustrated that nobody has access to the drawings of visor and 
        locking devices", said the marine engineer Heimo Jaakula, one of the Estonian 
        experts and advisors. ..." </i></font></p>

      to Turku was the arrival of 'DIANA II' at the Turku Repair Yard where she 
      was prepared for flag change from Swedish to Estonian flag and name change 
      to 'VIRONIA', which was subsequently changed to 'MARE BALTICUM'. Onboard 
      of 'DIANA II' were some of the ESTONIA survivors and a number of members 
      from ESTONIA's 2nd crew. Moreover 'DIANA II' was a near sister to ESTONIA 
      with more or less identical visor and bow ramp constructions including the 
      locking systems. All this was to be closely inspected by the Swedish and 
      Finnish JAIC members and the Sjöfartsverket observer Sten Andersson. The 
      detailed photo documentation existing in the files of the Swedish JAIC was 
      made during those days. <br>

        following information to you. <br>
        <b>Note</b>: Forssberg knew of course that Andi Meister being the chairman 
        was the point of entry but politeness is not known to be one of his virtues. 
        <br>
        1. A few technicians of the Swedish and the Finnish parts of the investigation 
        board are visiting the shipyard at Nådendal in Finland on 11 October to 
        study the Diana II, sister ship to Estonia. The visit is primarily for 
        general familiarization, including study of ramp detail. The bow visor 
        is unfortunately welded shut so the visir and ramp function cannot be 
        examined in detail." <br>
        Forssberg then continued with other matters: "<br>
        2. We understand from newspaper articles from Tallinn that you are disturbed 
        by Nordström & Thulin not providing you with desired technical information.

        Sept, were rescued. We would appreciate if you can confirm if that is 
        the case and give details for our general information.<br>
        4. We would appreciate if you could send reports of the hearing of Estonian 
        witnesses. We will make the translation." </i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In response Pedak advised 
      by phone that two professors from the Tallinn University would also attend 
      on the 'DIANA II' and that they had been promised by B.V., Paris that they 
      would supply them with the required documentation. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In summary of the information 
      submitted so far on the previous pages, it can be concluded that the Finns 
      and Swedes co-operated quite closely in matters concerning the wreck, the 
      visor and whatever else might have been on the bottom of the sea in this 
      area, however without informing the Estonians at all. On the other hand, 
      the Estonians did withhold information, at least as long as possible, in 
      all matters throwing a bad light on the ferry, the crew and/or the E.N.M.B. 
      and the ESCO/Estline organisations including possible explosions onboard. 
      Thus already from the very beginning the JAIC was split into two groups 
      of interest, i.e. the Finns and Swedes on the one side and the Estonians 
      on the other, and it is quite obvious that it would be most advantageous 
      for both sides if a casualty scenario and a cause consideration could be 
      found which was simple to understand, close to reality and which did not 
      affect the interest spheres of any of the three countries represented in 
      the JAIC, but could be used <i>"to set an example by teaching the shipbuilding 
      industry a lesson"</i> (Andi Meister). </font></p>

        1. Attached I am sending you the previously mentioned summary of the Kikuts 
        interrogation.<br>
        2. As Börje certainly did report the crew of "Vironia" (previously "Diana 
        II") is now here in Nådendal. There are dozens of persons having for one 
        year or so worked onboard of "Estonia". They know a lot about the vessel's 
        matters. Among others there is also mate Kukk, who shall possibly be heard 
        by us in Tallinn. "Vironia" shall stay at Nådendal for 2 weeks. Is it 
        useful to hear these men by the Commission, e.g. by the end of next week? 
        Will you be sending a representative from your side to here? Part of the 
        men only speak Estonian. We could arrange for a proper tape recording 
        at Nådendal. (Handwritten note on the left side: To be taken up in Tallinn 
        17.10.) <br>
        3. I have asked an expert at PCIMA, a teacher at the Institute of Technology 
        Kotka, Seppo Rajamäki, to help us analyse the radio communication which 
        took place here in Finland. He is teaching radio communication to ship 
        officers. It is the intention that to begin with he will correct the original 
        transcripts of the tape recordings which were typewritten and to attach 
        a time table to the text. <br>
        4. PCIMA's expert in navigation electronic, Asser Koivisto, has met some 
        Russians. They reported that a NAVISAILOR 2000 ECDIS chart system of Russian 
        make had been installed on "Estonia" which registers the covered route, 
        speed and the like. It is possible to take out data from the installation 
        even after it has been in sea water for sometime. In case Sweden should 
        decide for reasons of ship-technical investigations or for other reasons 
        to have the wreck examined by divers, the above-mentioned installation 
        should be brought up, according to Koivisto, the matter should be given 
        a relatively high priority and should be speeded up. The Swedish pilot 
        Benny Pettersson, who frequently piloted "Estonia" knows the exact location 
        of the installation on the bridge. <br>
        5. We hope to make video images of the key areas on the new video films. 
        It is our intention to send a series of colour copies to each country 
        before Tallinn. In addition we are preparing several copies for an eventual 
        press information. I assume that a similar number of journalists will 
        be coming to Tallinn as were at our last meeting in Turku. The really 
        international press will hardly come at all. Yesterday when we published 
        the Mayday tape there was only one journalist present who did not understand 
        Swedish and Finnish. <br>
        6. Finland's police have collected in Hangö Freeport the liferafts from 
        "Estonia" that floated ashore and delivered by various vessels. There 
        shall subsequently be an inspection report on each raft. FBN inspector 
        Jan Jansson, who is also expert to PCIMA, had a look at them. There are 
        also rafts in Estonia (some of them have already been stolen)." </i></font></p>

      3rd meeting of the JAIC, this time in Tallinn. At the meeting the questioning 
      of the key witnesses from the crew was continued respectively started again 
      from the beginning. According to the notes of Tuomo Karppinen the 3rd engineer 
      Margus Treu, the watch A.B. Silver Linde and the trainee mate Einar Kukk 
      were heard. As usual with this commission it was not an organised taking 
      of statements, but the witnesses were questioned in the presence of the 
      whole JAIC and everybody asked what he wanted to ask. <br>
      This time Treu's evidence had changed because he did not mention water on 
      the car deck at 01.00 hours again which he previously said to have reported 
      to the bridge, but now saw Linde at 01.00 hours on the car deck "coming 
      from the pumping station for visor and ramp", although according to his 
      own statement Linde was at 01.00 hours on the bridge and according to Kukk 
      the vessel abruptly heeled to starboard at this time. It is unknown whether 
      this remained unnoted by the audience or whether attempts were made to clarify 
      these differences. The 2nd Interim Report of the JAIC reads as follows:</font></p>

        Tallinn on 17 October 1994 the Joint Accident Investigation Commission 
        (Sten Andersson did not attend) reviewed new information available to 
        it as a result of additional video films taken from the sunken ship and 
        confirmed the following conclusions of the First Interim Report:" </i><br>
        <b>Note: </b>The visor was still not found "officially". <br>
        <i>"I The bow visor was lost underway."</i> <br>
        <b>Note</b>: The JAIC believed that the visor was lost when the vessel 
        was proceeding at full power against 4.5 m significant wave height which 
        includes 8-9 m seas. This position was maintained all the time and is 
        part of the scenario of the Final Report. <br>
        <i>"II Water entered the car deck at the forward ramp." </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: This is true because it was observed by Treu, Kadak and Sillaste 
        on the monitor and the ramp was found to be open at the wreck. <br>
        <i>"The Commission also assumed the following positions regarding the 
        details and one of the most probable causes of the accident: <br>
        1. The bow door (visor) has separated from the ship as a result of failure 
        of all three locking mechanisms. According to the observations made by 
        members of the crew this happened at about 01.15 when water was simultaneously 
        observed on the TV-monitor, entering the car deck from openings along 
        the vertical sides of the forward ramp. The failures have taken place, 
        in case of the two side locks in the welding of the locking eye plates 
        to the bow visor and in case of the centre lock (as previously shown) 
        by failure of the lugs carrying the locking plunger unit." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Already on the ROV videos from 02. and 09.10.94 the extremely 
        thick welding seams of the side lock lugs are visible, which were created 
        by cutting off/rewelding of the lugs several times as it was observed 
        by many truck drivers - <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">see Subchapter 
        12.5 </a>- however this is not mentioned by the JAIC.<br>
        <i>2. "Following the failure of the locking arrangements the bow visor 
        has opened up under the wave loads. The deck mounted hinge points have 
        eventually failed as a result of the uncontrolled movement of the 55 tons 
        visor, leaving it attached only by the hydraulic actuating cylinders. 
        <br>
        3. During the subsequent unrestrained movement of the bow visor it hit 
        the bow ramp in several modes, including hits from the rear to the upper 
        protrusion of the ramp, causing it to become dislodged from its locking 
        arrangements and to move to a partly open position. The bow visor has 
        ultimately separated from the ship and disappeared overboard." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Apparently at this time JAIC had not yet realised the interlock 
        between visor and bow ramp, i.e. that the upper part of the ramp was extending 
        into the ramp house being part of the visor, which means that if the visor 
        would move forward the ramp would get in contact with the aft part of 
        the ramp house. As long as the visor was empty however and the ramp properly 
        locked and secured, nothing could have happened because the empty visor 
        was unable to break the locks and hooks of the ramp as long as they were 
        intact. Unfortunately neither was the case. See <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a>. <br>
        <i>4. "Partial opening of the ramp had allowed water to enter the car 
        deck due to the heavy sea. Collection of water on the car deck eventually 
        led to loss of stability and capsizing of the vessel." </i><br>
        <b>Note: </b>The JAIC does not yet say that the ramp was fully open but 
        just states "partial opening". Nevertheless, the JAIC seems to believe 
        that the opening was big enough to allow the penetration of a sufficient 
        quantity of water within a very short time 01.15-01.30 hours, i.e. 15 
        minutes from visor off to vessel on the side. <br>
        <i>5. "After the vessel had turned over to almost 90 degrees starboard 
        list, which is estimated to have taken place in less than twenty minutes 
        after the damage to the forward ramp, it started to sink with the stern 
        first. The ship disappeared from the radar screen of a Finnish surveillance 
        station at 01.48. <br>
        6. The vessel turned during the phase of losing stability and landed on 
        the sea bed with an almost easterly heading. It is assumed at this stage 
        this movement was partly the result of an attempt by the officers on the 
        bridge to turn the ship around and partly by the wave action after the 
        ship had lost propulsion power."</i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: They did not yet say whether the vessel turned to port to 
        starboard.<br>
        <i>7. "The locations of the EPIRB-s have not been found during the video 
        documentation and their status is therefore not known at the present time." 
        </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: At that time both EPIRB-s had been found in switched off 
        condition already 15 days before, but this as well as the location of 
        the visor were kept secret. <br>
        <i>8. "Emergency MAYDAY signals were sent by ESTONIA at 01.24 and were 
        received by ships in the area and the MRCC at Turku." </i></font></p>

        Accident Commission convinced what cause the Estonia shipwreck. Estonia's 
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together 
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull made water flow 
        on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the ship 
        completely changed. <br>
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces 
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, 
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the Accident Commission, who was not present 
        at the Monday session in Tallinn. Also from other very informed sources 
        DN has received the same information, that holes in the hull contributed 
        to water getting into the ship so quickly (...) <br>
        According to Sten Andersson the three visor locks, two on the sides and 
        one at the bottom, was ripped off. This can be seen from the new underwater 
        pictures taken. <br>
        DN's source, with very good insight in the ship's construction, has difficulties 
        to believe that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic lock - could 
        have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. I rather believe that 
        the visor attachments on the deck has broken and that the 54.5 ton visor 
        fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock." "According to the source of 
        DN this scenario gives "violent mechani-cal damages and big holes in the 
        hull". Those holes will then be situated under the water line in the heavy 
        sea." </i></font></p>

        ESTONIA Accident <br>
        Further to our exchange of information yesterday, you have probably noticed 
        that the bow door has now been found and identified. It is located on 
        the seabed about 1 nautical mile west of the wreck itself. This seems 
        to indicate that the captain has attempted to turn the ship around at 
        an early stage of the development of the accident, however without success

      for example item 12 referring to the stabilizer fins: <br>
      <b>Draft Version 24.10.94:</b></font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"12. The stabilizer

        gravity after failure of the hydraulic system."</i></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The draft version states 
      that "both fins seem to be in retracted position" while the final version 
      states that only "the port side one seems to be in retracted position". 
      This implies that Stenström knew that the starboard fin was not in retracted 
      position, but apparently also not in extended position which should be the 
      case created by gravity if the fin would have been intact. Since the starboard 
      fin was apparently neither retracted nor extended, it has to be assumed 
      that it was missing. <br>

      of the 'NORD ESTONIA' Per Ringhagen and Sten Levander, and further with 
      the Stockholm pilots having piloted the ESTONIA frequently,<br>
      - the employees of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm Shipinspec office,<br>
      - the management of N&T and Estline. From 9 to 18 November the visor was 
      searched and finally lifted by the Finnish multipurpose ice breaker 'NORDICA' 
      assisted by the Swedish mine hunter 'FURUSUND'. <a href="chapter26.htm" target="_blank">See 
      Chapter 26. </a>During the lifting operation Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka 
      from the Finnish JAIC were present on board of the 'NORDICA'. <br>
      The visor was landed ashore in Hangö and put on blocks in upside down condition 
      at the premises of Messrs. Levator Oy where it stayed in the open air until 
      it was shipped to Sweden by the Swedish Navy in December 1999. The visor 
      was closely examined by members and experts of the JAIC from all three countries 
      and it was subsequently decided to have the bulkhead parts in way of the 
      torn off lugs of the hydraulic side locks cut out and transported to the 
      Royal Technical High School (KTH), Stockholm. This was carried out after 
      the 23 November because when representatives of Meyer Werft inspected the 
      visor for the first time on that day these parts were still in position 
      and are thus visible on the photos then made. <br>
      Andi Meister writes in his book "<i>The Unfinished Logbook"</i> about the 
      visor inspection as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"On 2 December the 
        inspection of the visor in Hangö took place. In addition to the other 
        acknowledged experts also the scientists of the Estonian Shipping Company 
        (ESCO) and of the Technical University of Tallinn, August Ingerma and 
        Jaan Metsaveer, participated. It was now also established by means of 
        squeezed steel parts that the visor had pulled open the ramp and that 
        the ramp had been completely open until becoming partly closed again when 
        the vessel turned upside down.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Swedish Government 
      had instructed Sjöfartsverket already on 3 October to develop possibilities 
      to recover the bodies out of the wreck and it was thus decided to have the 
      wreck examined by divers. A description of the work required was drawn up 
      in the form of tender conditions which were sent to 14 contractors - see 
      also Chapter 27 - and the job was finally awarded to Smit-Tak/Rockwater, 
      i.e. Smit, Rotterdam, the world's leading salvage company. The contract 
      was signed on 29 November and the work began on 1 December, however, was 
      delayed due to the wrong wreck position stated in the tender conditions 
      - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27.</a> <br>
      Also the JAIC was given the opportunity of having parts of the wreck examined 
      and taken up. In order to make the necessary decisions Börje Stenström (and 
      most probably Tuomo Karppinen) attended on board the diving support vessel 
      'SEMI I' while the Estonian side was represented by Aarne Valgma, the head 
      of the Sea Safety Division of the E.N.M.B. and the man who could have prevented 
      the last sailing of the ESTONIA (and consequently her sinking). <br>
      As the JAIC had made up their mind already what had caused the sinking of 
      the ferry, their interest remained restricted to the bow area and to some 
      limited extent to the bridge where allegedly three bodies had been found 
      (although there were at least 5), which were allegedly not identified although 
      some of them were wearing uniforms. The cabins of master, chief engineer, 
      radio officer and the owners' cabin all located directly below the bridge 
      were allegedly not examined. At least nothing is mentioned in the official 
      reports. There was however another "unofficial" diving investigation going 
      on at the same time - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
      27</a>, <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 34.6 </a>and the Disengage 
      Report in <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      34.6.434.</a> - the result of which regrettably has never been made public. 
      It is certain however that the work of this "unofficial" diving team was 
      executed with the consent - if not on instruction - of a certain Swedish 
      government authority. A number of objects from the wreck were recovered 
      by divers and brought to the surface, among others the lugs of the Atlantic 
      locks burnt off in a rather unprofessional way, i.e. each lug was burnt 
      off instead of burning off the whole deck part to which the lugs were welded. 
      Due to this way of burning, the bottom parts of the lugs - say the lower 
      20-30% were missing - which made the lugs look rather small. Also the sensor 
      plate fitted next to the lugs was burnt off but thrown to the sea bottom 
      by the diver and thus disappeared forever. <br>
      <b>Note</b>: The examination of this sensor plate ashore would doubtless 
      have proven that the holes for the screws having previously held the sensors 
      were corroded to such an extent that it would have been obvious that the 
      sensors had been removed already several months before the casualty, a violation 
      of the class requirements which would have forced B.V. to withdraw the class 
      of the ferry in hindsight with substantial consequences for the owners.

      In addition to the sensor plate also the sensor cables were clipped off 
      and thrown to the sea bottom by the diver obviously for the same reason, 
      because on the video footage it is clearly visible that these cables were 
      cut and not broken by being torn off, of which N&T tried to persuade B.V. 
      and the JAIC in endless argumentation and writings. Obviously with success 
      because B.V. did not withdraw the class nor did B.V. ever criticise N&T/ESCO 
      and the JAIC just noted on page 128, Subchapter 8.6.6 of their Final Report:

        position sensors for the bottom lock were not in position on their mounting 
        bracket according to pictures taken during the ROV and diving investigations. 
        The electric cabling that had been part of the sensor installation and 
        the ends of the cables were visible in the area. The mounting bracket 
        for the sensors appeared to be intact or possibly bent slightly aft. No 
        other signs of any mechanical action could be seen on the bracket. The 
        12-millimetre-diameter bolt holes for the originally installed mechanical 
        switches were empty. It is not fully clear how the magnetic sensors had 
        been installed on the bracket. The magnet which was part of the bottom 
        lock position indicator was after the accident visible on its mounting 
        bracket in the locking bolt. According to information obtained from the 
        electrical engineer who installed the magnetic sensors and the magnet 
        in the mid-1980s they were of the Siemens 3SE6-type." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> According to a member of the 2nd crew the sensors had been 
        dismounted and the cables were cut at the end of the ice winter in April 
        1994. The sensors were not reinstalled as the crew members had to go down 
        anyway and open respectively close the bolt of the Atlantic lock by hammering, 
        as this was no more possible hydraulically due to the severe misalignment 
        and distortions of the lugs. Therefore a remote control was no more required.

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Atlantic lock bolt, 
      however, a most important piece of evidence in the JAIC's chain of argumentation, 
      was brought to the surface but, much to the surprise of the outside world, 
      thrown back into the sea by Stenström, allegedly after having measured its 
      thickness and found it to be undamaged and straight, a statement, which 
      is apparently false, as must be concluded from the rather good video footage 
      available - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2.</a><br>
      It has to be assumed that Stenström very well realised from the explanations 
      and pictures of the diver that the lugs of the hydraulic side locks could 
      do substantial damage to the JAIC scenario when brought up to the surface 
      and subsequently being examined ashore. The extremely thick welding seams 
      would have proven that they consisted of several welds on top of each other, 
      i.e. frequent cutting off/rewelding had taken place. Furthermore it would 
      have become known that the missing bulkhead parts to cover the holes in 
      both aft bulkheads of the visor (where the lugs had been sitting) were not 
      attached to the lugs (apart from a tiny piece). This meant that the lugs 
      had no more been welded to the bulkheads as original but had just been stuck 
      through pre-cut holes and then welded on to the remnants of previous welding 
      seams. Al this was naturally combined with a substantial reduction of the 
      initial load carrying capacity of the locks. Stenström decided to leave 
      the locks in the wreck. <br>
      The recovery of the visor hinge bolts which had already been ordered to 
      the divers was stopped also. A close examination of these bolts would have 
      brought results - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2 
      </a>- for the JAIC casualty scenario. <br>
      By fax of 06.12.1994 to Andi Meister, Stenström briefly reports on the diving 
      inspection (see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27</a>)

        Number 4, starboard side. No damage, same play at pin." </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not state that the port outer hinge was found 
        to be bent and misaligned, with the bolt moved to starboard, both securing 
        plates missing and the port "outer eye" (lug) slipped off the bolt. He 
        also failed to mention the mattresses, bed-clothing, blankets and rags 
        squeezed between ramp and bulkhead at the port outer ramp hinge, although 
        this had become public knowledge (see DN of 07.10., page 59 above). <br>

        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention that the ramp is bent longitudinally, 
        is resting on the starboard bulkhead with a gap existing between the port 
        bulkhead and the ramp, i.e. that the ramp has been exposed to pressure 
        from port to starboard, which had led to very severe deformations of all 
        the transverse beams, except for the lower ones and to deformation of 
        the longitudinal beams in the lower area which he interpreted to have 
        been caused by contact with the forepeak deck. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2.</a><br>

        Some damage at top." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> He means apparently the damage to the port outer beam which 
        was bent and distorted at the upper side, but the severe damage to the 
        inner ramp plating in the upper third with burnt and distorted plates 
        and also the distorted flaps in way of the centre line at the top and 
        the bottom of the ramp are not mentioned. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2.

        in <b>retracted</b> condition inside the bulkhead opening with the piston 
        rod broken at the lug fitted to the lugs at the ramp side. These lugs 
        at the ramp side were missing. The videos also show that the starboard 
        ramp actuator was also broken, once at the lug, same as the port one, 
        but again at the piston rod because this part was found by the diver to 
        be jammed in between ramp and bulkhead recess. The remains of the piston 
        rod and the actuator were noted inside the bulkhead in retracted condition. 
        The lugs at the ramp side are missing, the fastening of these lugs was 
        found to be blown open and distorted. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>

        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention the diver's report that there 
        was a misalignment of 21/2 inches = 10 cm at port side between the plungers 
        (bolts) and the mating boxes which also existed between the ramp hook 
        and the mating lug. He also did not mention that both port mating boxes 
        as well as the mating lug and the ramp hook were found to be intact which 
        means that the entire port side of the bow ramp had not been secured at 
        all upon departure from Tallinn (and numerous voyages before already).

        <b>Note: </b>The examination of the bridge - under the aspect of acci-dent

        Summary of Technical Findings and Technical Evaluation of the Probable 
        Sequence of Events and Cause of the Accident.<br>
        </i></b><i>The investigation of technical facts related to the accident 
        has continued with high priority. <b>The findings and conclusions reported 
        and agreed on during the meeting on 17th October in Tallinn are essentially 
        still valid</b> but various additional findings have been made and the 
        related probable development of the accident has been further clarified 
        and modified. .... <br>
        The summary below describes the technical findings and also the effect 
        these may have had on the development of the accident. <br>
        1. All evidence found so far confirm the hypothesis that the mechanical 
        failure started with failure of the lower locks of the visor. Most probably 
        the bottom lock failed first. The mounting lugs for this lock have been 
        recovered from the wreck. <b>They indicate that the failure in the lugs 
        has been caused by overload and also that the actual welding of the locking 
        plunger housing to the lugs has been less extensive than presumed in the 
        engineering calculations. The total load carrying capacity of the mounting 
        of the bottom lock has therefore been less than intended. </b>The internal 
        work routines of the shipyard relevant for this condition are being discussed 
        with the yard."</i><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Note:</b> <b>1. Failure 
        in the lugs has been caused by overload: </b><br>
        The subsequent investigation by Prof. Hoffmeister - see <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        34.8</a> - Enclosure 34.8.436 - proved that the welding seams between 
        "locking plunger housing" and lugs were up to 90% penetrated by fatigue 
        cracks. <br>
        <b>2. Welding of the "locking plunger housing" to the lugs has been less 
        extensive than presumed in the engineering calculations:</b><br>
        The welding seams found were about 3 mm thick while according to the Meyer 
        yard welders having done the job, they were 7-8 mm thick originally which 
        was also in conformity with the yard's standard welding rules when welding 
        a 15 mm thick component to a structure. In such case each weld had to 
        correspond to 50% of the thickness of the component to be welded. Thus 
        it has to assumed that the welds and probably also the lugs were not original 
        and definitely the rather poor repair welds of the starboard lug did not 
        originate from the yard. - See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        12.5</a>. - The JAIC was not interested and arranged for a paint analysis 
        of the starboard lug only in December 1996. <br>
        3. The total load carrying capacity (lcc) of the bottom lock has therefore 
        been less than intended.<br>
        According to Stenström's own calculation the lcc of the Atlantic lock 
        had been only 70-80 ts. while actually a subsequent break test with 3 
        m welds revealed a break load of 220 ts. See <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter

          the recovered bushing with the part of the broken visor arm still attached.

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>38.5 Further<br>
    Investigations and Meetings </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">At the beginning of September 
    6 Finnish statements of the key witnesses of the crew and the statement taken 
    in Hangö from the nautical student Rain Oolmets were received from the Finnish 
    JAIC. Almost one year after the casualty had passed before the first statements 
    could be studied and evaluated by this 'Group of Experts'! <br>
    In the meantime Stenström continued to give interviews in support of the JAIC 
    scenario and cause consideration and, in particular, drew the attention of 
    the media to the poor condition of part of the visor hinges and the locking 
    devices for which, in his view, the building yard was to be blamed with the 
    naïve argument that the JAIC was unable to find anybody who would admit to 
    have done repairs as sloppy as described during the lifetime of the vessel, 
    or that they could not find any recording on them.<br>
    Nevertheless the communication between Stenström and this 'Group of Experts' 
    was continued. <br>
    At a further meeting in Stockholm on 2 October Stenström reported that the 
    next JAIC meeting would be on 17/18 October in Tallinn. At the subsequent 
    meeting in Stockholm on 5 December, the technical part written by him - see 
    the Part-Report - would be finally agreed upon. The JAIC's scenario and cause 
    considerations would not be changed. Nevertheless, he agreed to have a look 
    at the facts considered by this 'Group of Experts' not to be in dispute and, 
    further, to another meeting to be held in Stockholm during the first week 
    in November. Stenström also reported that the tank tests with a model of the 
    ESTONIA had shown that at a speed of 10 kn the same loads on the visor occurred 
    as at a speed of 14.5 kn, however not as often. <br>
    Stenström furthermore admitted that up to 30 ts. water could have been in 
    the visor. <br>
    Note: This was not surprising because this is the quantity indicated by the 
    highest water mark visible inside the visor. <br>
    This means that the lower part of the bow ramp including the hinges had been 
    under water. Stenström further stated that the heavy damage to the port outer 
    ramp hinge - as visible on the videos - had existed already since some time 
    before the casualty. As a result - in his opinion - the bow ramp could not 
    be closed properly at the port lower edge, thus was open to the visor up to 
    about 20 mm. This - so he said - was also the reason why the port lower securing 
    bolt of the ramp was unable to engage its mating pocket at the ramp side. 
    He then stated that the Estonian crew had put this severe damage repeatedly 
    on the repair list since some time already, however without N&T doing anything. 
    He said that he had copies of these repair lists. Stenström argued further 
    that because the bow ramp had been partly open for some time already, there 
    must have always been water on the car deck if the theory of the German 'Group 
    of Experts' would be correct. However, as there had obviously not always been 
    water on the car deck the visor could not have been filled to the outside 
    water level. Unfortunately the observations of previous passengers and, in 
    particular, the statement of Pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a> and <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.4.4</a> 
    - were at that time not yet known to this 'Group of Experts'. They prove beyond 
    reasonable doubt that there had indeed been water on the car deck already 
    in 1993 and the worse the weather got the more water had been on the car deck.<br>
    In any event, Stenström had stated that the bow ramp could no more be properly 
    closed for some time before the casualty, that the crew had demanded repairs 
    which were rejected by N&T. It follows already from this fact that the ferry 
    had been initially unseaworthy with the knowledge of the technical managers 
    and owners since some time before the casualty already. No mention of this 
    serious deficiency is made in the Final Report with the exception of the following 
    remark on page 42 - <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.3.6</a> 
    - "It was known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point 
    where corrective action would be needed". <br>
    By letter of 27 October the "the undisputed facts" were submitted by this 
    'Group of Experts' to the JAIC and a copy of the letter is attached as Enclosure 
    38.5. <br>
    Note: The letter was registered on 2 November 1995 under B125 in the logbook 
    of the Swedish JAIC and was declared classified until 9 March 1998. <br>
    This 'Group of Experts' expressed once again its regret that it was not possible 
    for the JAIC to travel to Hamburg and/or Papenburg:<br>
    <i>"Once again we have to express our regret that is has not been possible 
    for you to visit us here in Hamburg and/or in Papenburg. Many things would 
    have been much easier to transfer to you respectively prove to you, if you 
    would have spoken to the individuals personally and asked your own questions, 
    be that now the von Tell representative Todsen, the BV surveyor Lohmann or 
    the welders, locksmiths, foreman, etc. of Meyer Werft having been engaged 
    respectively responsible, e.g. for the welding of bushings into the lugs of 
    the Atlantic lugs or the lugs to A-deck or the steel bushings into the bores 
    of the visor arms etc., all of whom have been identified. Anyway this can 
    still be arranged if you should wish so."" </i><br>
    As there was no response, it was decided to take one of the welders to Stockholm 
    to the next meeting. This was welder Koenen who had welded, among other things, 
    the locking devices in the foreship area of ESTONIA during its construction. 
    <br>
    The next meeting with the JAIC took place in Stockholm on 9/10 November and 
    before the meeting this 'Group of Experts', together with the Meyer Werft 
    welder Koenen, had about two hours time to look - undisturbed and in detail 
    - at the recovered objects stored in the basement of the KTH. The comments 
    of welder Koenen after this close inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs can 
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "(a) Starboard lug with 
      bracket (Nr. 3)<br>
      - the welding seams at the outer side were made from the upper side to the 
      lower side, when the lug was in erected condition, i.e. welded to A-Deck, 
      be means of a very thin electrode; <br>
      - although if the lug was erected the welding seam should have commenced 
      at the lower side and then gone upwards, which it did not;<br>
      - when the initial welding seam between the lug and the bushing was laid 
      in the workshop the lug was lying flat which creates a totally different 
      welding structure from the one visible at the lug remains; - the bracket 
      is not original for many reasons,</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> i.e. it is longer than 
      the bushing was because both welding seams end already ca. 15 mm before 
      the end of the bracket: </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">the end is cut very roughly 
      - as would never have been done by the yard</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the welding seams were 
      not made by the yard for the above-mentioned reasons. They are laid very 
      unprofes-sionally and the ends of both welds are not connected at the top 
      of the bracket, i.e. seawater could and obviously had penetrated the welds 
      and seeped underneath the bushing with corrosion following therefrom." </font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This means that the Atlantic 
    lock found was not the original and this was presented in detail to the JAIC 
    at the meeting commencing at 11.00 hours with welder Koenen also in attendance. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC was represented 
    by the following persons: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström : for Sweden 
      <br>
      Mikael Huss : <br>
      Tuomo Karppinen : for Finland <br>
      Klaus Rahka :<br>
      Prof. Jaan Metsaveer : for Estonia </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">To begin with the findings 
    and conclusion of the inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs were submitted 
    in detail and in summary. It was concluded that the lugs of the Atlantic lock 
    welded to the forepeak deck were no more original. Due to the red paint below 
    the blue it had to be assumed, however, that the lugs had been exchanged already 
    when the vessel was still "VIKING SALLY" which was noted by the JAIC in silence 
    and without further comments.<br>
    Subsequently the participants of the JAIC were invited to ask questions to 
    welder Koenen about the yard practice, welding standards or whatever else, 
    but in particular about their view expressed as in the Part-Report conclusions, 
    namely:<br>
    "<i>- The visor locking devices were constructed with less strength than required 
    according to calculations. It is believed that this discrepancy developed 
    due to lack of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions 
    for certain parts of the devices."</i> Not a single question was, however, 
    put to welder Koenen who left with the impression that none of the experts 
    of the JAIC was the least interested in his testimony. His impression was 
    correct, because the JAIC reiterated in their Final Report what they had assumed 
    to be the facts already in November 1994. <br>
    <i>"The attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic 
    calculations required. It is believed that this discrepancy was due to lack 
    of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions for certain 
    parts of the devices." </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The meeting went on and as 
    this was the last meeting in Sweden and also the last one with Börje Stenström 
    attending, the subjects of discussions shall be outlined in some detail:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> JAIC: The vessel was assigned 
    the highest B.V. class symbol, it could consequently operate in worldwide 
    trade.<br>
    German 'Group of Experts': This is true, however, the trading area of a passenger 
    vessel is defined in the PSSC, which is issued only after the class certificate 
    has been submitted to F.B.N. The PSSC restricted the trade of the vessel to 
    "kustfaart mellan Finland och Sverige", i.e. coastal trade between Finland 
    and Sweden. <br>
    JAIC: This restriction referred to the radio operator only. In case AB Sally 
    would have put a radio operator onboard the ferry could have traded "Short 
    international voyages", i.e. 600 nm between 2 ports and no more than 200 nm 
    from the next port, i.e. the ferry could have sailed between Helsinki and 
    Gothenburg. <br>
    German 'Group of Experts': It had been agreed in the building contract that 
    the vessel had to be built for an "intended trade", i.e. for the Viking Line 
    service Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm. <br>
    JAIC: This referred only to the "partial collision door" while the contract 
    is otherwise open. <br>
    German 'Group of Experts': The well known fact that the "partial collision 
    door" was not installed is indeed proof that the vessel was built for a particular 
    trade, for which according to the opinion of the responsible maritime administration 
    - F.B.N. - such a "partial collision door" at the location required by SOLAS 
    was not necessary.<br>
    JAIC: It was also in 1979/80 a well known fact that the Finnish and Swedish 
    owners sold their ferries after 8-10 years in service to owners operating 
    in entirely different areas of the world. Thus it would only be logical to 
    build the ferries for worldwide trade.<br>
    German 'Group of Experts': This is the shipowners' concern. The yard builds 
    the vessel according to the contractual agreements, class rules and requirements 
    of the maritime administration.<br>
    Subsequently the development of the ferries built for AB Slite and AB Sally 
    from 1969 to 1980 beginning with "APOLLO" and "DIANA" and ending with "VIKING 
    SALLY" was explained, the discussion between Sjöfartsverket/Wahnes on basis 
    of his logbook concerning "bow ramp = collision bulkhead" for "DIANA II" the 
    attitude of the F.B.N. as to "VIKING SALLY", etc. were outlined. Further the 
    "Copenhagen Convention" was handed over as well as this 'Group of Experts' 
    report about "The description of the process of conversion from design to 
    production of the locking devices" which can be found as part of Subchapter 
    2.4.6. This 'Group of Experts' explained also the background of the "partial 
    collision door" clause in the "VIKING SALLY" specification ("EARL OF GRANVILLE" 
    conversion) and the initial offer of the yard to install this partial collision 
    door for DM 45.000,-- which was rejected by the owners. It would, however, 
    have been possible at any time to have these doors installed for less than 
    DM 100.000,-- in case the trading area would be changed to outside of "sheltered 
    waters" as it occurred when the ferry's route was changed to Tallinn-Stockholm. 
    <br>
    JAIC: Probably a yard has to argue differently than a Government commission, 
    who will definitely and sharply draw attention to the faulty practice followed 
    by the maritime administrations of the Nordic countries for decades by accepting 
    the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead on car/passenger 
    ferries. The JAIC is of the considered opinion that according to SOLAS the 
    maritime administra-tions may not grant exemptions in this respect, even not 
    if the ferry trades regularly within 20 nm from the nearest land. Stenström 
    said that it is a fact that in the Baltic about 70 ferries have been trading 
    on which the bow ramp was the collision bulkhead. Of these 70 ferries 35 had 
    the interlock between ramp and visor. The first vessel with such a construction 
    was built in Finland. Meyer Werft is not responsible for it, Stenström said. 
    It is considered a fact that the way "VIKING SALLY's" visor/bow ramp were 
    built corresponded in those years absolutely to the state of the art and technique. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 November Klaus Rahka 
    from the Finnish JAIC phoned a member of this 'Group of Experts' and reported 
    the following:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had carried out 
      a break test with the mock-up of a side lock. It broke at 134 ts. load.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They further carried 
      out a bending test with the mock-up of the visor lug being part of the Atlantic 
      lock. The load required to cause a deformation as found was found to be 
      200 ts., i.e. the Atlantik lock had held at least 200 ts according to Klaus 
      Rahka.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström was present 
      during the tests and his comment at the end was: "We are not changing the 
      report. Why should we be that friendly to the yard?" </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This attitude was also reflected 
    in the next telephone conversation on 12 December when Börje Stenström stated 
    the following:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The publication of the 
    Final Report had been postponed.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had a full commission 
    meeting last Monday/Tuesday (04./ 05.12) with Andi Meister, Enn Neidre, Uno 
    Laur and two professors attending from Estonia. </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Purpose of the meeting was 
    to establish what else had to be done.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> As far as the technical 
    side was concerned (his job) they believed that the factual side was well 
    covered by the Part-Report already, which would not be changed very much, 
    although some analysis will still be carried out.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On the operational side 
    they would have a long distance to go because the Estonians practically had 
    not delivered anything, although Andi Meister - being no more a Minister - 
    was said to be writing every day. Enn Neidre and Uno Laur have neither commented 
    in writing nor verbally, they are absolutely passive. T</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">he Swedish and Finnish side 
    developed the opinion they have to investigate the operational/educational 
    side themselves, but do not know how, because the information is more or less 
    exclusively in Estonia. They had hoped that something would come from their 
    Minister, but so far in vain.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Next meeting will only 
    be mid February 1996. </font> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This means that the date 
      for the publication of the Final JAIC Report, announced with so much enthusiasm 
      only a couple of months before had been postponed to some unknown time in 
      the future. <br>
      In this connection a fax has to be mentioned which was sent by Kari Lethola 
      already on 12 November to Olof Forssberg only, which reads - office translation 
      - as follows:<br>
      <i>"Representatives of the F.B.N., Chief Director Muttilainen (No. 2 in 
      the organisation), Valkonen, the legal man Makkonen and the engineer Fabricius 
      - met at the beginning of last week in Hamburg Holtappels, Hummel and possibly 
      some other representatives of Jos. L. Meyer Werft. The yard had invited 
      them to come to Hamburg. Simo Aarnio interviewed Makkonen subsequently. 
      Makkonen repor-ted that the yard's representatives had first asked whether 
      the F.B.N. had anything "against the yard". The answer was no. Possibly 
      the yard wanted to check whether there could be a conflict of interests 
      between F.B.N. and the yard in case of possible legal proceedings in the 
      future. Thereafter they presented the results of their investigation. I 
      hope that we shall have the same information after the Friday meeting in 
      Stockholm. In any event, they do further maintain their theory that the 
      hinges broke first and not the Atlantic Sicherung. Fabricius took the same 
      view during subsequent discussions. He had inspected the visor in Hangö 
      before the trip to Hamburg. Tuomo and Klaus shall come and interview Fabricius 
      pretty soon. <br>
      The Papenburgers have also pointed out that "Estonia" had traded with a 
      water-filled visor for quite a long time already (almost all the time). 
      There are clear indications for that inside the visor.<br>
      Holtappels did further indicate that in case of possible legal proceedings 
      against the yard they would right from the beginning disregard the JAIC 
      investigation results to the effect that no one could use it as evidence 
      against the yard. This would be done on the grounds of bias (partiality) 
      of all three Estonian members. Holtappels did not give any reason for this, 
      but possibly he means that </i></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The contents of this fax 
      allows the following rather astonishing conclusions:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) Even after almost 
      14 months of "joint" investigations the Estonians - although being in the 
      chair - were not informed and thus did not take part in crucial decisions 
      concerning the reliability and credibility of JAIC. <br>
      (b) The chairmen of the Finnish and Swedish JAICs were pretty much aware 
      of the background of all three Estonian members and as Olof Forssberg reported 
      to Inez Uzman, the Swedish Minister for Communication and Transport, and 
      Kari Lethola reported to the Minister for Justice in Helsinki, it has to 
      be assumed with certainty that the problems were well known at least inside 
      these administrations as parts of the respective Governments. Nevertheless 
      nothing was done from their side until Dr. Holtappels raised the point. 
      It finally led to the resignation of Enn Neidre in April 1996 as member 
      of the JAIC. He remained, however, an expert of the Estonian JAIC and as 
      such participated undisturbed in the work, had access to the complete documentation, 
      attended the meetings as before and even participated in the drafting of 
      the Final Report. Whether this nominal change in the position of Enn Neidre 
      did improve the reliability and credibility of the JAIC is a question for 
      the reader to decide. <br>
      (c) Remarkable is finally how experts with differing opinions - like Mr. 
      Fabricius - were being treated: Tuomo and Klaus had "to talk" to him. <br>
      Note: As a matter of fact engineer Fabricius never showed up again in this 
      case. <br>
      (d) The meeting between the F.B.N. and this 'Group of Experts' was already 
      the second one and confidentiality had been agreed. The validity of agreements 
      with the management of F.B.N. seems to be rather short. In this case it 
      was broken by F.B.N. immediately after their return to Helsinki. <br>
      At a subsequent meeting in Helsinki on 23 November between Kari Lethola/ 
      Klaus Rahka and a member of this 'Group of Experts' the following information 
      was received:<br>
      - Andi Meister, the head of the International Commission (IHK), was no more 
      the Estonian Minister of Transport but was sitting at his home writing the 
      Estonian version of the report; they had so far however received nothing. 
      <br>
      - Uno Laur as the personal representative of the President of Estonia in 
      the "Estonia" matter came together with the President, Andi Meister, Enn 
      Neidre and the then Prime Minister by military plane to Turku on 28 or 29.09.94 
      - probably 28.09.94. The Prime Minister was at first also a member of the 
      Estonian intermediate commission but was subsequently fired, when it turned 
      out that he was a weapons smuggler. Tuomo Karppinen was also in Turku on 
      that day, the first one in the early morning hours had been Kari Lethola.<br>
      Note: According to the notes made by prosecutor Birgitta Cronier, then in 
      charge of the ESTONIA case, on the morning of 28 September 1994 "Kari Lethola 
      is already on site in Utö". See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.463.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      38.5.463.</a></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The co-operation between 
      the part commissions could be better. Each national part of the JAIC was 
      working internally on its subject, the exchange of information/documentation 
      was basically restricted to the meetings. This refers in particular to the 
      Estonians who have produced very little, so far, but also to the Swedes. 
      Börje Stenström is an acknowledged expert in naval architecture, but it 
      seems almost impossible to persuade him of other alternatives once he has 
      made up is mind. He is not a good casualty investigator. They are expecting 
      a lot of problems before the Final Report is agreed upon.<br>
      - They know nothing about the working lists where the twisted port hinge 
      of the bow ramp was mentioned repeatedly for repairs.<br>
      - This 'Group of Experts' explained to them the connection water in visor 
      / gap in ramp / water on car deck / clothing around the port hinge of the 
      ramp. They were themselves puzzled about the many clothings hanging around 
      that area which could only be explained as the crew plugging the gap in 
      the ramp from time to time when the ramp and visor were closed.<br>
      - They will continue to investigate the above circumstances. The probability 
      that the scuppers on the car deck were open was also discussed, that one 
      or several non-return valves were blocked, that pipes leading from scuppers 
      on car deck towards outboard through the 1st deck (deck below car deck) 
      were corroded/leaking and in connection with open non-return valves water 
      penetrated the starboard side of the 1st deck (vessel had a permanent starboard 
      list of 4-5° around which she was rolling probably up to 10° to starboard).<br>
      - In the further discussion it became very obvious that they would like 
      to do a much more technical investigation with the fantastic possibilities 
      they have in VTT, however, however this was rejected by the Swedes respectively 
      allowed to a rather limited scope only. <br>
      - They were also informed about the repeated invitations of this 'Group 
      of Experts' to the JAIC to come to Hamburg and Papenburg, to talk to the 
      von Tell representative and relevant yard workers, which they did not know 
      at all. Obviously the channel of information between the JAIC and this 'Group 
      of Experts' ended on the private desk of Börje Stenström. The invitation 
      was repeated to them and they promised to consider. <br>
      - Kari Lethola promised to try to find the passenger of "SILJA FESTIVAL" 
      who has told the newspaper HELSINGIN SANOMAT (published 29.09.94) that ESTONIA 
      left Tallinn with open visor.<br>
      Note: At that time the statement of this passenger had been in the file 
      of Lethola for sometime already. He denied during the following 2 years 
      frequently to know the name, however, when some of his files were finally 
      inspected by members of this 'Group of Experts' in December 1998 the statement 
      was found and copied. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/19.236.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      19.236.</a><br>
      - It was agreed to send them everything in copy which was sent to the Swedish 
      Commission and further on to send them blind covers. <br>
      This was the first time for this 'Group of Experts' to get the chance to 
      look at the other side of the coin and make the amazing experience that 
      the relationship between the Finnish and the Swedish parts of the JAIC was 
      not as good as demonstrated to the outside and, in particular, that this 
      was basically due to the behaviour of Börje Stenström. Moreover, that Stenström 
      basically dictated the scope of the technical investigations exclusively 
      in accordance with the hypothetical casualty scenario and the cause considerations 
      developed by him. <br>
      Already in December everything which had been submitted in writing to Stenström 
      was sent in copy to the Finnish part of the JAIC and further on they received 
      blind copies of all correspondence. <br>
      It was also considered to be remarkable that Stenström had not informed 
      the Finns about the damaged port outer hinge of the bow ramp and the consequentially 
      open part of the bow ramp to the water-filled visor, which, in fact, rendered 
      the ferry initially unseaworthy with the privity of her owners/ tech-nical 
      managers. The Estonian part of the JAIC knowing these circumstances, of 
      course, from their questioning of the relief crew remained silent. It is 
      unknown what the Finns did after having been informed by this 'Group of 
      Experts' about such grave deficiency as the partly open bow ramp being plugged 
      with mattresses, blankets and similar material to avoid the worst - water 
      in large quantities on the car deck - from the always at sea water-filled 
      visor. No official reaction was noted until Karpinnen made himself the laughing 
      stock of the shipping community when he invented the "floating mattresses" 
      during the press conference in which the Final Report was presented. <br>
      The total disregard of Börje Stenström for orderly investigation is further 
      demonstrated by the way in which he chose to file documentation he received 
      in his capacity as JAIC member. Instead of having the documents registered 
      in the logbook as provided for by law he kept them unregistered at home. 
      Only after his death in February 1997 were these documents found in his 
      house, and subsequently registered with the small notation "Inh. fr. BS 
      971006 or 970326" meaning "Arrived from Börje Stenström on 06.10.97 or 26.03.97". 
      This should of course also have been done with the repair lists of ESTONIA 
      on which the repair request for the damaged port outer hinge of the bow 
      ramp was made, however these lists were never registered.<br>
      Note: The alleged "List of maintenance and repair works on M.V. 'Estonia': 
      April 1993 - August 1994" - attached as Supplement 230 - just contains the 
      engine and electrical part - deck is not mentioned. Moreover this "List" 
      was received by the Swedish JAIC from N&T only on 31.10.97 - five weeks 
      before the publication of the Final Report. - See Enclosure<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.465.htm" target="_blank"> 
      38.5.465.</a> <br>
      The year 1995 ended with a letter from Börje Stenström dated 22 December 
      by which he asked in total 11 questions with regard to the contents of the 
      memo this 'Group of Experts' had handed over at the November meeting - the 
      letter is attached as Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.464.htm" target="_blank">38.5.464 
      </a>and shall be commented on in connection with the reply dated 22 January

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>39.4<br>
    The Survivors' Statements </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">As stated before, the non-classified 
    statements were copied from the files of the Swedish JAIC in January/February 
    and sent in bundles to Hamburg. All statements were in the Swedish language, 
    i.e. the original Finnish and Estonian statements were already translated 
    into Swedish. See also Subchapter 36.5.<br>
    It took almost 3 months to analyse and evaluate the statements. The result 
    was astonishing as the hypothetical sequence-of-events of the JAIC did not 
    at all match with the statements of the survivors. It follows that the JAIC 
    had disregarded the passengers' statements and just relied on the testimonies 
    of the crew members, in particular, of Silver Linde and Margus Treu. <br>
    Note: Chapter 21.2 demonstrates the "reliability" of these statements. <br>
    The summary and evaluation of all statements, the changed sequence-of-events 
    and cause consideration as well as the conclusions resulting therefrom were 
    submitted - together with a summary of the technical findings in a 87-page 
    letter dated 22 July 1996 to Börje Stenström with copy to the Finnish part 
    of the JAIC. <br>
    Stenström wrote a few comments by the letter of 30 September, however, the 
    Finnish part of JAIC never did reply to this letter. The letter is attached 
    as Enclosure 39.4.471. It was classified by the Swedish part of the JAIC on 
    02.08.96 and declassified again on 06.03.98 - 14 months after the publication 
    of the Final JAIC Report. </font></p>

    Communication and Investigation as from April 1996 </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: Since the beginning 
    of 1996 the Finnish Environment Agency was preparing the removal of the fuel 
    oil from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA. This should be carried out by sophisticated 
    ROVs, able to cut holes into the vessel's side. The heavy fuel should then 
    be heated and sucked out by means of equipment which could, however, only 
    be used up to wind force 3-4 Bft. As this meant that there would be quite 
    some idle time at sea for the vessel "HALLI" from board of which the ROV was 
    operated, Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish part of the JAIC 
    took the chance to stay onboard at those idle times and used the ROV for examinations 
    of interesting parts of the wreck. See Chapter 28. This 'Group of Experts' 
    was kept closely informed and even asked what they wanted to have examined. 
    Thus a fax with various points of interest was sent to Tuomo Karppinen on 
    18 April - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.472.htm" target="_blank">39.5.472</a>. 
    Tuomo Karppinen also wrote down in a memo which items the Finnish part of 
    the JAIC would like to have examined and as it is revealed from the memo that 
    their requirements went much farther than those of this 'Group of Experts'. 
    Also Börje Stenström wanted more and better pictures from the wreck when he 
    wrote by fax of 15 April to Tuomo Karppinen: <br>
    "re: Pictures from 'Estonia'. <br>
    After some consideration I can still see the necessity for us to try to get 
    better pictures from the damage to the deck and the front bulkheads, inclusive 
    of pictures through the holes in the vessel. Furthermore, close-ups of the 
    electric cables to the sensors of the bottom lock, in particular the free 
    ends and the backside of the plate to which the sensors had been mounted."" 
    <br>
    See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.474.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.474. </a></font></p>
  <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">He should have remembered 
    that the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables had been cut off in 
    his presence by the divers in December 1994 - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    27</a> - and thrown away. <br>
    Since it was one of the really urgent requirements of this 'Group of Experts' 
    to have an own look at the wreck the Finnish part of the JAIC was requested 
    to permit a member of this 'Group of Experts' to attend one of the planned 
    ROV surveys. This was however at once and categorically rejected. Nevertheless 
    Karppinen and Rahka kept reporting on these ROV inspections, for example Karppinen 
    on 29 April: <br>
    "The water was so dirty that the ROV operators refused to put their equipment 
    into the water in order not to endanger it. All the time the Norwegian M.V. 
    "TERTNES" was dropping sand and rocks into the water only 100 m away from 
    the wreck, therefore the visibility was zero. "TERTNES" left on Sunday and 
    will return only in June. They will make another attempt by ROV next weekend. 
    So far they have searched the whole wreck except for the extreme aft and found 
    nothing - no hole cut into the side."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Börje Stenström, whose 
    health was continuously deteriorating, complained bitterly about the Estonians 
    who still had not delivered anything, thus the Swedes had practically taken 
    over everything from them. Enn Neidre was replaced by Pritt Mänik. He stated, 
    that they had accepted our letter of 22.01.96, also the plugging of the bow 
    ramp by the crew and it will be included into their report. He was aware of 
    the fact that the Estonian witnesses were lying to them and did not tell the 
    full story, however, "What can we do?" <br>
    Note: They should have listened to the surviving passengers. <br>
    He did not read the Hellberg book, but others in the Commission have and feel 
    that the yard is "treated quite well". When the gap in the bow ramp was further 
    discussed, it turned out that the gap was now apparently an admitted fact. 
    Stenström also spoke about the interlock between visor and bow ramp and it 
    turned out that he believed that the visor could only be closed if the bow 
    ramp was properly closed and locked. He was informed that the visor could 
    be almost closed (for painting purposes) if the bow ramp was fully open. Also 
    the water in the visor and on car deck was discussed and the passenger video. 
    Stenström was informed in detail about the missing material at the starboard 
    hinge compared to the port hinge. Stenström further informed that their report 
    was still not ready and that they would send the draft to N&T, ESCO, B.V. 
    and the yard before it would be finalized so that all parties involved would 
    have a last chance to comment on their respective parts. Stenström further 
    advised that they believed to have enough evidence to evaluate their case, 
    but if any diving on the wreck would be done they would certainly want to 
    examine certain things. Compared to the Part-Report they had "softened" the 
    Final Report not to put more or too much blame on the yard. They did not get 
    the information about the officers from the Estonians which they need. They 
    cannot even blame them for the speed. He will send the draft report next week. 
    Margus Treu has said that the watertight doors were open. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">June: During a telephone 
    conversation on the 5th Klaus Rahka advised that he would go out by tug to 
    M.V. "HALLI" tonight, to attend another ROV inspection of the wreck. They 
    had a meeting of the technical group, i.e. B. Stenström, T. Karppinen, Metsaveer 
    and Ingerma, M. Huss and himself. The atmosphere was quite relaxed and it 
    seems that they do accept a break load of 175 ts for the side locks now. <br>
    Subsequently Rahka wrote as follows:<br>
    "With respect to doing a test including weaker than actual weldments we seem 
    to share an interest toward a test, because that would be the only practical 
    way to find the magnitude of an extreme minimum strength of a lock of this 
    general configuration. As it is now - estimates of minimum strength have only 
    been made analytically, and we see a strong chance that these estimates inevitably 
    produce low values for the strength estimates. The forepeak structure is high 
    quality FE 37-type steel, which thanks to its high ductility could work to 
    even out loads between the three lugs, thus raising the result above that 
    obtainable by calculation only. Technically it would thus be valuable to determine 
    the behaviour of such a structure, because the assumptions underlying the 
    analytical calculations most likely underestimate load sharing between the 
    three lugs. An experiment would be the only reliable way to find how much 
    this technical minimum is larger than the analytical estimate." <br>
    Such a test was subsequently also carried out and for details see Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.3</a> and 39.2. The complete fax is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.475.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.475</a>. <br>
    On 8 June SVENSKA DAGBLADET published an interview with Olof Forssberg of 
    which some parts are quoted below: <br>
    "There is no guarantee that the Commission's report will be completed by the 
    2nd anniversary of the casualty. This was said by Olof Forssberg, chairman 
    of the Swedish part of the International Commission.<br>
    The delay of the report is a disappointment for many relatives. On the 2nd 
    anniversary the liability of the owners for the casualty becomes time barred 
    and the relatives had stated that they need the report of the Commission to 
    sue the owners. <br>
    It cannot wait </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">F: As there is a time-bar 
    period of 2 years the relatives cannot sit and wait for our report. They have 
    to commence legal proceedings on basis of own material, said Olof Forssberg. 
    <br>
    SvD: Why is the report so much delayed? From the beginning it ha been said 
    that it should come out 1 year after the catastrophe. Now it is uncertain 
    whether it will be ready on the 2nd anniversary.<br>
    F: It has to be borne in mind that we here in Sweden cannot do everything 
    in the commission. This is actually an International Commission with an Estonian 
    chairmanship. <br>
    F: There are always difficulties if one is working in a commission with leaders 
    from 3 different nations and if one is an own national commission. There is 
    hardly a subject which due to the language does not lead to delays and complications. 
    <br>
    Discussions about selection of words<br>
    F: The text is read and everybody has to agree, and that takes time. Always 
    discussions remain about the selection of particular words, in particular 
    in the judgement of people and people's behaviour, i.e. that the words have 
    to be chosen very carefully.<br>
    SvD: It has been said that the delay is due to disagreement within the commission? 
    <br>
    F: This I deny categorically. <br>
    SvD: Is there agreement between the delegates of Estonia, Sweden and Finland? 
    <br>
    F: In case we do not agree, we are writing our different opinions. Because 
    majority decisions are not allowed, we have to reserve our rights. <br>
    SvD: About a year ago the commission submitted a part-report concerning the 
    technical aspects of the casualty only. The behaviour of the crew shall be 
    dealt with only in the final report.<br>
    Olof Forssberg is today neither confirming nor denying information concerning 
    missing initiative of the Estonian crew.<br>
    SvD: What is your opinion about the picture of the master as outlined by the 
    journalists Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle in their book about the catastrophe? 
    The master is said to have been authoritarian and incompetent. <br>
    F: Talks with pilots show a different picture. There is much different information 
    about the master.<br>
    SvD: When 'Estonia' got the list, however, the master choose to turn to port 
    which increased the list?<br>
    F: Theoretically, it would have been better to turn to the other side. It 
    is, however, not so easy just to say that the master turned to the wrong side. 
    It is often so that in case of a list this side is turned into the sea, exactly 
    as the master did.<br>
    Bad Repairs<br>
    SvD: The yard which built the 'Estonia' is alleging that N&T neglected the 
    condition of the vessel and postponed necessary repairs. Can you reject this 
    allegations?<br>
    F: We shall comment on this in our final report, said O. Forssberg and added 
    that the German yard has "a number of theories at the present time". He pointed 
    out that the yard e.g. was interested in a Russian report which alleges that 
    the casualty was a result of the ferry having been used as a smuggle ship. 
    <br>
    SvD: Do you mean that the yard is looking for any straw to find an explanation 
    which would release her from liability?<br>
    F: We get the impression that they are trying to do that. <br>
    SvD: How was it to investigate the largest civil casualty in Europe in modern 
    times? <br>
    F: - Many times people are of the opinion that because so many have lost their 
    lives there must be a rather complicated cause for the casualty. There can, 
    however, be a rather banal accident even if the consequences are disastrous.<br>
    - It is easy to conclude that a lot of people must also have made a lot of 
    mistakes. Sometimes however life is quite simple such as that an accident 
    occurs. <br>
    SvD: Will the theories and speculations come to an end once your final report 
    is submitted?<br>
    F: No, because we have no access to the wreck the rumours will continue to 
    live. This was the same with the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg, Dag Hammarsköld's 
    air plane casualty and the murder of Olof Palme - theories are coming and 
    emerging in uniform distances." <br>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 13 June Klaus Rahka informed 
    that the ROV inspection of the wreck had brought nothing. It might be repeated 
    but Kari Lethola wants a diving investi-gation. Finnish divers had made an 
    offer already and one diver can work on site for about 20 minutes. One job 
    will be to closely film the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables of 
    the Atlantic lock sensors, however the wish list of this 'Group of Experts' 
    would also be favourably considered. Rahka was informed that his proposal 
    to make a further break test with tack-welds had been accepted and the test 
    was already being prepared. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">July: In early July the evaluation 
    of the many statements of the survivors was completed and based on the noise 
    and time scenarios revealed from these statements, a new casualty scenario 
    was developed which differed considerably from that of the JAIC. The present 
    stage of the technical investigation by this 'Group of Experts' including 
    the interpretation of the passenger video, the summaries and evaluations of 
    all survivor statements and the consequently newly developed casualty scenario 
    and cause consideration were - as stated before - submitted to Stenström with 
    copies to the Finnish JAIC. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.4.471.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.4.471.</a> <br>
    While in the Swedish and Estonian media a squabble was carried out between 
    Andi Meister/Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg and other Swedish JAIC members and 
    experts, the rumours that Andi Meister would resign from the JAIC were growing 
    and, indeed, on 30 July he resigned. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström commented 
    this as follows: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi Meister was already 
    very tired at the last meeting and had indicated that he was considering to 
    retire. They believe that the Estonian complaints about the Swedes withholding 
    evidence was just an excuse to create a break in the commission which, however, 
    would not be permitted by the politicians on both sides. The Estonians were 
    apparently under growing internal pressure to avoid what becomes more and 
    more obvious viz. that the main blame lies with the management and crew and 
    that the evidence given by the Estonian crew members is wrong. Stenström further 
    said, that he had a lot of material at home which was not even registered. 
    See also <a href="chapter35.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 35.7</a>. He declared 
    not to have the repair list for the bow ramp damage. He was told by chief 
    engineer H. Moosaar (of the 2nd crew), Hobro and Rasmusson that the copy remained 
    onboard. That was clear, however, where was the original? No reply. </font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">August: The diver videos 
    and three amateur videos were received, viewed and evaluated which took time 
    and the further development and discussion of the new casualty scenario took 
    even more time. Sweden and Finland were on vacation. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">September: On 5 September 
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' met with the Finnish part of the JAIC 
    in Helsinki when a copy of the passenger video was handed over - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    39.3 </a>- and all subjects were discussed. It turned out that the JAIC trusted 
    the model test results of SSPA more than the reports of the survivors and, 
    further, maintained their initial findings and casualty scenario in spite 
    of all the contradictory evidence submitted to them by this 'Group of Experts' 
    and others. The results of the meeting are summarized in a memo and because 
    this was the last meeting with the JAIC the conclusions shall be quoted a 
    follows: <br>
    <i>"Tuomo Karppinen, who is obviously in overall charge of the evaluation 
    of statements, is very uncertain and unsure. He was apparently following instructions 
    when submitting the scenario explained under 1.8. without creating the impression 
    of being entirely convinced himself. In addition, he obviously has not yet 
    carried out a detailed evaluation of the statements, which is really necessary 
    to understand the full background. The obvious fact that his nautical experience 
    is limited to some yachting does not make it easier. Consequently, it again 
    has to be concluded that the Commission is still not doing the required work 
    as it has to be and can be expected with a case of this dimension. It is not 
    enough to explain all indications of an early starboard list with "but the 
    seas continued to strike from port side until the visor fell off."</i><br>
    It has to be decided now whether we shall spend some more time in explaining 
    to them in more detail why the starboard list must have occurred much earlier, 
    etc. The next Commission meeting is at the end of September. They will under 
    all circumstances complete their report before Christmas, even if it should 
    not contain the latest stage of the investigation. The pressure from government 
    side is said to be very severe." <br>
    By letter of 30 September Börje Stenström commented on some of the issues 
    raised in the letter of this 'Group of Experts' but no word abut the survivors' 
    statements and the resulting new casualty scenario. <br>
    Since 24 September Uno Laur was the chairman of the JAIC. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">October: The exchange of 
    information by fax and telephone between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' 
    continued and some time was spent with the discussion of the statements of 
    ex-boatswain Luttunen, who testified that the three lugs of the Atlantic lock 
    on the forepeak deck had been renewed in 1982/83, most probably by von Tell 
    AB, Gothenburg. The JAIC did not accept the statement of Luttunen, because 
    it was not confirmed by other crew members having been onboard with him. It 
    led, however, to an analysis of the paint layers of the starboard lug and 
    the visor lug which revealed that the basic primer of the starboard lug was 
    grey and of the visor lug was yellow. As the basic primer of the foreship 
    at the newbuilding stage had been yellow, this analysis result confirms the 
    Luttunen statement, but even despite such improved knowledge the statement 
    was still disregarded by the JAIC.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> November: The JAIC had a 
    commission meeting for three days in Stockholm from 19-21 November at which 
    24 persons attended, among them Enn Neidre - who as the reader will recall 
    - had officially resigned from the JAIC. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.477.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.477</a> - List of Attendants. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">December: Following the above-mentioned 
    meeting various JAIC members and experts made different statements to the 
    media, and the yard was again attacked. Soon thereafter Börje Stenström wrote 
    an apologetic fax to Dr. Holtappels, which is quoted as follows: <br>
    "You will no doubt learn through your press monitoring about what was going 
    on in Stockholm during the past days. A radio channel reporter had talked 
    to an outside expert, getting the impression that there were additional facts 
    about the locking mechanisms beyond what is mentioned in the Part-Report. 
    This led to activities in several other media including two TV channels by 
    which I have been interviewed. I stated repeatedly in the interviews that 
    we do not point out who installed the lock attachments of their current dimensions. 
    Unfortunately this was now picked up in only one of the broadcasts, but rather 
    an impression that it was now more clear than before that the yard had installed 
    undersized lockings. <br>
    Lawyer Witte was also interviewed and claimed quickly that chances to sue 
    the yard will now increase. I will call Witte Tuesday morning to explain to 
    him that his conclusions are not based on facts of our report, on the contrary 
    we will remain silent on the issue of who may have installed the weak parts."

    <br>
    Changes in the JAIC</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Estonian chairman Andi 
    Meister resigned on 30.07.96. The chairmanship had been offered to Kari Lethola 
    and to Olof Forssberg, however, was rejected by both of them as the Prime 
    Ministers of Estonia, Finland and Sweden had decided on 28 September 1994 
    that the chairman should be Estonian. Only in the course of September did 
    Uno Laur accept the appointment and took over the chair on 24 September. Already 
    on 30.07.96, the day of Andi Meister's resignation, Heino Jaakula - from the 
    Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.) - was appointed as member. <br>
    In April Enn Neidre had already resigned from the JAIC upon pressure from 
    Sweden and Finland caused by the remarks of Dr. Holtappels (see Chapter 38.4). 
    As stated above Neidre was replaced by Pritt Männik, but remained an expert 
    to the Estonian JAIC and participated in this capacity full scale in the JAIC 
    work including the drafting of the Final Report. The initial judgement that 
    the JAIC was biased due to its Estonian members remains upheld. <br>
    The Finnish expert Simo Aarnio passed away on 22.01.96 and was replaced by 
    Kari Larjo on 27.02.96. <br>
    There were considerably more changes to come which will be explained in the 
    following chapter 40.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.3<br>
    The Development from July to December</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>July: </b>In the meantime 
    the "WASA KING" specification dated 25.09.92 which had been received at the 
    exhibition from the Turku Repair Yard - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.96</a> - had been translated and evaluated. See <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    3.4</a> - when Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 1 July and reported the following:<br>
    - He would finish the Report in two weeks, then everything would be in the 
    printing house and the printing would start.<br>
    - The result would be the 1st draft which would then be sent to all members 
    and experts for comments to be delivered by mid August. The enclosures would 
    be in a separate supplement of about 500 pages.<br>
    - After printing of the final version the Report would be published circa 
    mid to end September.<br>
    - A new Swedish Commission would be formed to investigate everything the Swedish 
    Government did or did not in connection with the ESTONIA; <br>
    - Karppinen was then asked whether he knew about the repair specification 
    dated 25.09.92 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.96</a> - which he confirmed and further advised that he had spoken with 
    Tuomo Mäkki about it, who had made an offer for the bow ramp hinges but not 
    for the visor locking devices.<br>
    Note: This is true. Behind the respective item is a handwritten note: "Price 
    to be quoted after visual inspection." Apparently Mäkki never inspected the 
    locking devices visually because in the meantime it had been decided to sell 
    the vessel and only those items were repaired by the sellers which had to 
    be rectified according to the sales contract. <br>
    Karppinen further explained that he had also spoken to the last Finnish inspector, 
    Charles Richardson from Wasa Line, who had told him that at the time the specification 
    was made up by the crew they did not know that the vessel would be sold.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Next the possibility that 
    the Atlantic lock had been changed after newbuilding was discussed and Karppinen 
    said that there was a small chance because the basic primer of the visor lug 
    was found to be yellow but on the starboard lug grey. <br>
    Note: Actually the basic primer of all lugs had been yellow at newbuilding 
    - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 2.4.6</a> and<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.6.63.</a> <br>
    - Finally Karppinen advised that it had been decided that this 'Group of Experts' 
    would receive no parts whatsoever from the JAIC Report before the publication.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>August:</b> On 13 August 
    Tuomo Karppinen advised on the following:<br>
    - The draft version of their Report had now been distributed to the members 
    and experts except for three chapters which are still missing. <br>
    - He expects amendments, because after all delegations have read through the 
    draft he is certain that not everybody will agree. - Amendments are sent to 
    him and he incorporates them into the existing text. <br>
    - They still hope to publish around the 3rd anniversary. <br>
    On 15 August the Swedish JAIC had a working meeting in Stockholm. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>September:</b> From 3 
    to 5 September the Swedish JAIC went again through the text of the Report 
    and apparently concluded the matter. During this meeting it came to a clash 
    of different opinions which led to the resignation of the psychological expert 
    Bengt Schager three days later on 8 September. In a subsequent interview by 
    Jutta Rabe, Bengt Schager did explain the situation as follows:<br>
    <i>"BS: It was a meeting where we should look at the text. I was prepared 
    for that meeting because as I figured out, it was the last chance to alter 
    some of the details in a favourable way as I regard it is the truth. I was 
    very well prepared and got the message that this meeting would only deal with 
    the language problems and such things and that the report should be printed 
    even though not all the chapters were ready, I didn't think that this was 
    a proper way of working with it and then I told them that I would resign and, 
    also I might mention, before that, when Olof Forssberg was the Swedish chairman, 
    he was in favour for the opportunity for me of having a special opinion also 
    printed into the report and then, later on, I understood that Mr. Laur would 
    never allow a special opinion from me printed in the report. This, together 
    with the rush in timing was the basis for my decision, and the long frustration 
    also. <br>
    Q: But you emphasize just at this moment that their truth and your truth, 
    so there is a difference between your truth and their truth? <br>
    A: There is a discrepancy and, of course, I believe that I am right, but I 
    don't know and that's why I would like to be revealed my thinking when the 
    report is there, so that everyone who is reading the report and listening 
    to me, or, perhaps is reading what I am writing at that time and can see for 
    themselves and judge, because when you are one against 20 you have some difficulties 
    with, you have consequences with your relations, with the rest of them, and 
    arguing for something, when you have 20 against you, of which 10 are silent 
    but hostile and 10 are arguing against you, you have a friend at your side 
    frequently saying: "Bengt, stop, for heaven's sake, stop," then you may come 
    to a point, where you are really questioning yourself. Then, after a while, 
    you have to continue because you are believing in a certain thing and the 
    rest of them could not really give me good arguments. So, then you have to 
    continue, in a way. Even though, of course, it makes you sometimes a little 
    bit uncertain whether you really have right or not." </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 18 September Tuomo Karppinen 
    started during a telephone conversation: <br>
    - He received the comments/corrections from members and experts on Monday, 
    8 September, and has given the corrections to the printing house this Monday, 
    15 September.<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - He will receive 
    three printed copies in about two weeks which will then be read through again 
    by the English language expert and himself at least twice.<br>
    - Then the final version goes to the printing house and then it takes 4-5 
    weeks, i.e. publication mid to end November. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 22 September during a 
    further telephone conversation Tuomo Karppinen said that they will have another 
    full commission meeting in Tallinn due to unexpected difficulties with the 
    text and only thereafter the final corrections can be made and printing started, 
    i.e. publication early December. <br>
    On the same day "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published an ariticle which contained 
    the first interview with Bengt Schager after his resignation and which reads 
    - office translated - as follows:<br>
    <i>"'Estonia' Report is Protecting the Crew. <br>
    The 'Estonia' Report is incomplete. The Estonian chairman tries to avoid criticizing 
    the crew and this has disturbed the work of the commission, alleges an expert, 
    who resigned from the investigation. <br>
    Turbulent Investigation. <br>
    The investigation of the International Commission was accompanied by numerous 
    delays, censorship, accusations, criticism by the Judicial Ombudsman and change 
    of chairmen. <br>
    July 1996: The Estonian Chairman Andi Meister resigned after having severely 
    criticized the Swedish part of the Commission. <br>
    May 1997: Olof Forssberg, chairman of the Swedish part of the Commission, 
    was forced to resign after having lied to a radio reporter. <br>
    "I don't trust the Commission any longer", said Bengt Schager, psychological 
    expert of the 'Estonia' Commission, who resigned from the investigation under 
    protest. Now the 'Estonia' Report, which will be submitted to the printing 
    house shortly, risks loosing much of its credibility. <br>
    Bengt Schager is of the opinion that the commission did not properly investigate 
    the safety culture onboard of 'Estonia'. The question was much too sensitive. 
    "There has been a preparedness to talk matters and circumstances unfavourable 
    for the crew to their advantage." </i><br>
    <i><b>Bad Quality. </b></i><br>
    The 'Estonia' Commission is a three-nation commission with experts and members 
    from Estonia, Finland and Sweden. B. Schager means that the work was very 
    much disturbed by the obligation to reach agreement. The Swedes and Finns 
    had frequently considered giving up. <br>
    <i>"It has been so important to keep the Commission together to avoid that 
    somebody acts on his own initiative"</i>, he said.<br>
    <i>"I do not believe that the quality of the report is good. You find more 
    lessons to learn from this casualty than is mentioned in the report, there 
    had actually been lots of defects onboard"</i>, said Bengt Schager after almost 
    3 years work.<br>
    <i><b>Ferry Sentenced to Death.</b></i><br>
    Bengt Schager stressed that there is no disagreement inside the Commission 
    about the main cause of the casualty: These were technical defects which sank 
    'Estonia' down into the depth. The large ferry was sentenced to death. This 
    conclusion has never been in dispute. <br>
    The question about the acting of the Estonian crew in the very situation has, 
    however, been in dispute the more, Bengt Schager is of the opinion that there 
    are lots of question marks. <br>
    <i>"There are lots of things which belong into the report but which you cannot 
    find there",</i> he said. B. Schager is critical about the way the report 
    deals with the acting of the crew:<i> "Safety culture was with certainty not 
    at the standard which could be expected". </i><br>
    But he means that also other parts are defect. <i>"Certain analysis work was 
    more or less just average work. We should have gone much more into detail 
    and investigated much deeper",</i> he said pointing at the fact that they 
    were practically investigating Europe's largest ferry casualty in modern times. 
    <br>
    <i><b>Stressed Commission. </b></i><br>
    B. Schager sees two reasons why the investigation, according to him, shall 
    remain faulty (imperfect): Certain questions have been sensitive whilst the 
    commission has simultaneously been permanently under stress.<br>
    The investigation requirements could not withstand the requirements of the 
    media for a quick completion and, therefore, an incomplete report shall be 
    submitted.<br>
    B. Schager means that the Estonia Commission should have permitted herself 
    to investigate the matter properly." <br>

    40.3.481</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The interview is self-explanatory. 
    It confirms the bad atmosphere inside the JAIC which existed practically from 
    the very beginning, at first due to the dominant behaviour of Börje Stenström, 
    followed by the discrepancies which led to the resignation of Andi Meister 
    and finally due to the attempt of Uno Laur to protect Estonian interests.<br>
    On the 3rd anniversary of the catastrophe "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published a 
    small article under the heading "Investigation of the 'Estonia' Catastrophe" 
    which reads - office translated - as follows: <br>
    <i><b>"Criminal Violation of the Maritime Law and/or Causing Other Persons' 
    Death" </b></i>is the heading under which the Criminal Police is investigating 
    the 'Estonia' catastrophe going on parallel with the investigation of the 
    International Commission. In addition to survivors' statements the police 
    and the chief prosecutor have among other things interrogated representatives 
    of N&T, who had the technical responsibility for the vessel and of the classification 
    society B.V. who approved vessel's construction and condition. "Some further 
    interro-gations are pending", said chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, who 
    is leading the inquiry. The purpose of the inquiry is to find out it somebody 
    will have to be prosecuted for the 'Estonia' catastrophe." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>October:</b> On 17 October 
    Tuomo Karppinen reported as follows: <br>
    - The report was changed at the recent meeting and, as a matter of fact, they 
    are still discussing details.<br>
    - Next week the English language expert will come again for two days and check 
    the report whereafter it will go to the printing house.<br>
    - He estimates that it will take several weeks before the final version is 
    printed and they would be happy if the publication could take place before 
    the end of the year because this is what the politicians are demanding from 
    them. <br>
    - He said further that they were aware that "REGINA BALTICA" is either "VIKING 
    SAGA" or "VIKING SONG", but they did not look into the "NORD ESTONIA" matter 
    and they also had not realised that Ulf Hobro had been employed with Sjöfartsverket 
    as safety inspector before he joined N&T.<br>
    On 20 October Tuomo Karppinen reported more details:<br>
    - They have had a meeting in Helsinki with Ann-Louise Eksborg and Uno Laur 
    attending when the report and some minor changes were finally discussed. Casualty 
    scenario and cause considerations remained unchanged. The report is now finalised.<br>
    - Commencing tomorrow he will go through the changes together with their English 
    language expert Bing Crossfield from London, which might take two or three 
    days.<br>
    - Thereafter the changes will be worked into the existing manuscript by the 
    printers and a further manuscript will be printed, which he hopes to receive 
    around 26/27 October.<br>
    - He will then go through the complete manuscript once again and hopes to 
    be able to submit the final version by the beginning of November, i.e. week 
    45, to the printers who will then commence printing 5000 copies, which will 
    hopefully be completed in week 49.<br>
    - This means that the report will be published either in week 49 or 50. The 
    exact date will be fixed as soon as printing has started. <br>
    - Since the summer, i.e. after the exhibition of this 'Group of Experts', 
    they have included a new chapter into their report which concerns the "upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck" and have 
    tried to find an explanation for the attitudes of Sjöfartsverket and Finska 
    Sjöfartstyrelse.<br>
    Thereafter it was decided to have an up-date exhibition in Stockholm during 
    the time of publication of the JAIC Report and the preparations commenced 
    straight away. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>November:</b> In the early 
    days the Swedish TV 2 program "STRIPTEASE" showed the second part of their 
    "Estonia" investigation. It was apparent that the "STRIPTEASE" journalists 
    had a copy of the Final JAIC Report or one of the drafts of it, which they 
    had submitted to Prof. Vassalous of the West Clyde University, Glasgow, one 
    of the leading naval architects in the UK. Vassalous was asked to give an 
    opinion on the technical part and the conclusions, which he did.<br>
    The JAIC had concluded: <br>
    "The casualty sequence may have started around 00.55 hours when an A.B. seaman 
    heard a metallic bang behind bow ramp. Locks and hinges broke completely through 
    one or two heavy waves just after 01.00 hours. Consequence: The locks were 
    too weak. 'Estonia' had met similar wave conditions only once or twice earlier 
    between Tallinn and Stockholm. The accident occurred under conditions that 
    were probably the worst she had ever encountered. The casualty has no pre-history, 
    everything happened in one sequence and very quickly."<br>
    " Vassalous commented: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"To reach ultimate loads 
      at sea so that the components could fail in one or two loads is highly unlikely 
      . Most components that fail at sea do so because of fatigue, there must 
      have been a pre-history. Therefore the cause for the failures has to be 
      found in the condition of the ship, and especially of the visor."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>" The professor did not 
    accept that the visor was really completely o.k. on the casualty night nor 
    did he accept that the conditions were unique. He stated that cyclic loading 
    is the nature of any structure, failure caused by fatigue loading is "a fact 
    of marine life". </i><br>
    Failure to use common sense by the JAIC was his conclusion. <br>
    More uncertainty came up when the General Director of the E.N.M.B. and Estonian 
    observer in the JAIC, Kalle Pedak, and the head of the Maritime Division (Department) 
    of the E.N.M.B., Aarne Valgma, went public by giving an interview to the Baltic 
    News Service about the circumstances surrounding the diving investigation 
    of the ESTONIA in December 1994 when only Aarne Valgma had represented the 
    Estonian side. <br>
    The following is quoted from BNS message: <br>
    "The divers' mission, which lasted for 64 hours, was filmed and the video 
    picture was continuously forwarded to the support vessel. The Swedish Maritime 
    Administration, which had commissioned the mission, supervised it from aboard 
    the same ship, and also the Swedish criminal police observed the course of 
    the mission there.<br>
    Valgma said that during the 64-hour mission there were moments when there 
    was no video picture on his monitor. <br>
    "All I can presume is that the diving work was not filmed during those breaks." 
    Valgma told BNS on Thursday. Maritime Department general director Kalle Pedak 
    said it was not very likely there were breaks in the video recording during 
    the divers' mission. <br>
    <i>"Valgma had admitted that at intervals he saw no video picture in his monitor 
    room and had no access to the ship's main monitor"</i>, Pedak told BNS.<i> 
    "I believe there was a video picture on the main monitor all the time, because 
    the divers were constantly watched".</i><br>
    Pedak and Valgma didn't want to comment on why the video picture was interrupted 
    on the Estonian observer's monitor."" <br>
    The complete wording of the message is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.3.482.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    40.3.482</a>.<br>
    On 17 November the following message was received from the JAIC:<br>
    "Re: Press conference concerning the presentation of the Final Report of MV 
    'Estonia' <br>
    The Joint Estonian, Finnish and Swedish Commission to investigate the 'Estonia' 
    catastrophe presents its Final Report on 3rd December. The Commission meets 
    in Tallinn to present the Report jointly at 12.00 hours. Simultaneously the 
    Report is submitted to the Swedish and Finnish Governments. A press conference 
    shall be held in Estonia as follows:<br>
    Date : Wednesday, 3rd December 1997<br>
    Time : 13.00 hours <br>
    Place : Sakala Centre, 12 Rävala Avenne, Tallinn <br>
    The Report, which is in English, can be simultaneously picked up, i.e. at 
    the BoA/Stockholm at 11.00 hours and at the BoA/Helsinki at 12.00 hours." 
    T<br>
    his was the end of the communication between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' 
    because the JAIC ceased to exist after the publication of their Final Report.

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The decision to have another

    Report of the International Commission was based on </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">(a) the growing certainty 
    that the International Commission would conclude in their final report that 
    the casualty was mainly caused by the too weak locking devices of the visor 
    due to faulty design, etc.;<br>
    (b) the fact that such an Exhibition was the only possibility of proving quickly 
    and convincingly to the national and international media as well as to the 
    Swedish public that the above-mentioned conclusions were wrong;<br>
    (c) the frequently stated wish of many visitors to the 1st Exhibition to come 
    back and give them the chance of comparing the findings of the JAIC with the 
    findings of the German 'Group of Experts' after the Final Report had been 
    published. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Preparations</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Based on the experience with 
    the 1st Exhibition it was decided to organise everything in close cooperation 
    with the two relative organisations SEA and DIS and moreover to invite them 
    to perform the exhibition jointly with this 'Group of Experts' and participate 
    actively in the day-to-day preparations. This was welcomed by both organisations. 
    Whilst SEA offered the assistance of their vice chairman Odd Lundkvist, who 
    had been a conference/exhibition manager before his retirement, DIS offered 
    the services of their technical expert Alve Wendt as exhibition guide in order 
    to help this 'Group of Experts' with the many visitors to be expected. In 
    addition, SEA would show their own little exhibition simultaneously. The SEA 
    exhibition would draw attention to the crucial mistakes made by the Swedish 
    government in the handling of the ESTONIA affair. DIS wanted to put up some 
    screens whereupon they would outline what they thought were the real causes 
    for the disaster and who had done what wrong.<br>
    When it was definite that the Final Report would be published on 3 December, 
    1997 in Tallinn and copies could be picked up simultaneously in the JAIC offices 
    in Helsinki and Stockholm the following arrangements were made: <br>
    - advertisements should appear on 29/30 November, on 1 and 2 December, and 
    again on 8 December<br>

    This time no one was invited to the opening nor was there a press conference 
    on the occasion of the opening, nevertheless visitors started streaming in 
    right from the beginning and it can be said that the average number per day 
    was in the range of 200, however, there were days with twice this figure. 
    <br>
    The visitors spent a lot of time with reading, had less questions and thus 
    the stress for the Exhibition guides was much less than previously. <br>
    Also the atmosphere this time was different right from the beginning, it was 
    much more relaxed and free of tension, which was certainly to a considerable 
    extent due to the presence of the representatives of the relative organisations, 
    mainly the SEA Exhibition represented by Odd Lundkvist.</font></p>

    Visitors started to stream in even before the Exhibition was opened at 11.00 
    hours. The day was full of pre-arranged interviews with German Finnish, Swedish 
    and English TV and radio teams. Nobody from the writing press was spotted.

    Whilst the chair lady of the Swedish Commission together with the administrator 
    Gunnel Göransson were in Tallinn to attend the ceremony on the next day Lennart 
    Berglund and Odd Lundkvist managed to obtain substantial parts of manuscript 
    of the Final Report and members of this 'Group of Experts' started immediately 
    to analyse the contents. <br>
    The chairman of the Association of Swedish Marine Underwriters, Sten Gathenborg, 
    paid a visit to the Exhibition and everything was explained to him. He asked 
    thereafter whether it would be possible to have a private show for the Swedish 
    Marine Underwriters without the public and this was agreed for 9 December, 
    from 08.30 to 11.00 hours. <br>
    In the afternoon the Hamburg office phoned and informed that two complete 
    sets of the Final Report of the Commission including supplements had just 
    arrived by courier from Kari Lethola, the chairman of the Finnish JAIC, which 
    meant that almost 24 hours before the official publication the JAIC Report 
    was available to this 'Group of Experts'. The main parts were sent by fax 
    and the analysis commenced at once in order to have some comments already 
    on the following day. <br>
    During the evening and parts of the night the Report was analysed as well 
    as possible and already then it became quite obvious that </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC's scenario was 
    based on the possibility that the vessel could have encountered 1 or 2 heavy 
    waves which could have been able to break to locks of the visor, etc. and 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">the JAIC had completely 
    ignored the passengers' statements as to time of heel, water on 1st deck and 
    on car deck and</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC had completely 
    ignored the disastrous maintenance condition of visor and bow ramp; but had, 
    to the contrary, found that the vessel had left Tallinn in a completely seaworthy 
    condition, well maintained, manned and loaded. </font> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The conclusions were - 
      as already in the Part-Report from April 1995 - that "the visor attachments 
      were not designed according to realistic design assumptions ..." and "the 
      attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic calculations 
      required", etc. <br>
      So not very much had changed during the past 3 years, almost nothing of 
      what this 'Group of Experts' had submitted to the JAIC had been taken into 
      account, it was thus still the Yard and only the Yard on which blame was 
      put. <br>
      The defence was prepared straight away by so-called "First Remarks on the 
      Report of the International Commission" of which 400 copies were distributed 
      to visitors until the closing of the Exhibition. One copy is attached as 
      <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.4.483a.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures

      1997 </b><br>
      As of 11.00 hours the Report plus Supplements could be picked up by anybody 
      at the office of the Swedish JAIC. <br>
      An article appeared in "DAGENS NYHETER" wherein the previous psychology 
      expert Bengt Schager, who had resigned from the JAIC in September, stated 
      that ESTONIA had left Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition referring to the 
      evidence of the Sjöfartsverket inspector Åke Sjöblom, who had left the vessel 
      only shortly before her departure. This led to additional questions from 
      many visitors. <br>
      Next, Gerhard Klahn phoned from Ystad in Southern Sweden and stated to have 
      seen a TV interview with the above-mentioned Åke Sjöblom shortly after the 
      casualty during which he had said that they had found the bow ramp in a 
      totally unsatisfactory condition and had strongly recommended to their Estonian 
      colleagues not to permit the ferry to sail in this condition, which, however, 
      was ignored. He was then asked by the journalist what he would have done 
      if he had checked the ESTONIA in a Swedish port? He replied that under absolutely 
      no circumstance would the ferry have left port. </font></p>

      1997 </b><br>
      This was the day of the press conference of this 'Group of Experts' right 
      in the middle of the Exhibition. It began at 11.00 hours with approximately 
      40 journalists and four camera teams attending, many of whom had been in 
      Tallinn the day before. (Reportedly some 200 persons attended the press 
      conference of the JAIC.) Dr. Holtappels submitted the first analysis of 
      the JAIC's Report, drew attention to the obvious mistakes and wrong conclusions, 
      answered numerous questions from partly very insistent journalists who were 
      much better prepared than they had been in June. Simultaneously the survivor 
      from the 1st deck, Carl Övberg, was introduced to the media and told his 
      story and answered questions.<br>
      Thereafter it was explained by means of the models that the scenario of 
      the JAIC was not possible to have happened and, as a comparison, this 'Group 
      of Experts' scenario was presented, as supported by the statements of the 
      survivors and other facts. <br>

      The reactions to the press conference were: <br>
      - in DAGENS NYHETER : Nothing. <br>
      - in SVENSKA DAGBLADET : On page 6 a quarter-page article: "The German Yard 
      Criticizes The Report." <br>
      - in TT PRESSEN (nationwide): "The Yard does not accept any blame." <br>
      - in GÖTEBORG POSTEN: "German Criticism Against The Estonia Report."<br>
      "The Yard Is Supported By Sweden." Christer Lindvall, managing director 
      of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' Association, agrees to a certain 
      extent that 'ESTONIA' sank due to poor maintenance and not faulty design 
      or construction by Meyer Werft. <br>
      In the morning Lennart Berglund and Anders Lindström, managing director 
      of Sjöfartsverket, were interviewed on Breakfast TV and Lennart Berglund 
      stated to have reliable information that Åke Sjöblom had discovered the 
      damaged bow ramp and tried to stop the ferry. Lindström reacted with obvious 
      shock and said he knew nothing about this, but would certainly investigate 
      it. <br>
      This triggered off some press activities which were, however, overshadowed 
      by the new developments in the Palme murder case, which were told to the 
      media in a separate press conference at 10.00 hours. Probably for this reason 
      the press conferences of DIS and SEA at the same time were just attended 
      by one or two journalists.</font></p>

      1997 </b><br>
      The Exhibition was reopened at 11.00 hours and the visitors streamed in 
      more than before and the questions were sharper and more precise because 
      all of them had read the comments in the papers, followed the TV and radio 
      comments and sometimes had even studied the JAIC's Report respectively were 
      in the process of doing so and wanted to fill gaps by looking at the Exhibition 
      and asking questions. This was exactly what this 'Group of Experts' had 
      expected. <br>
      A number of retired masters, pilots, engineers, divers and even safety inspectors 
      from Sjöfartsverket came and stayed on an average of two hours. Many came 
      again on one of the next days. In addition, people calling from all over 
      the country and also from Finland, offered their knowledge, photos, videos. 
      <br>
      The repair manager of Turku Repair Yard, Arvi Puroya, also visited the exhibition 
      and upon being questioned he stated that <br>
      - N&T had not booked any drydocking space for January 1995 for ESTONIA,<br>
      - nor had he received any repair specifications. <br>
      He also confirmed that the only JAIC member or expert who had ever visited 
      the yard was Tuomo Karppinen. <br>
      One of the visiting retired pilots stated that the traffic controller of 
      Sandhamn had told him that he had frequently seen ESTONIA passing on her 
      way out with the visor slightly open. This was mainly during the last weeks 
      before the casualty. <br>
      Another visitor said that the weather statements in the JAIC's Report were 
      wrong and "selected". The naval architect Per Fagerlund stated that he had 
      immediately called his friends at SSPA when he heard the nonsense of Karppinen 
      that the speed had had no relevance for the catastrophe and they had strictly 
      rejected to have found anything during their tank tests which would support 
      that and also had made it quite clear that they did not want to be quoted 
      in this connection. <br>
      A visitor, who refused to tell his name, stated that he had been working 
      for Stolt and had been on the Stolt diving support vessel "STOLT COMEX", 
      which had been on the ESTONIA position already a few days after the casualty 
      and which Stolt immediately offered to Sjöfartsverket for a diving survey. 
      He said that they had made some tests in the early stages and measured radio 
      activity near the vessel.<br>
      In the evening the Swedish JAIC explained their findings and conclusions 
      to the survivors and relatives. Reportedly Mikael Huss said that the Yard 
      had not only miscalculated the loads, but had also used the wrong low quality 
      steel. Ann-Louise Eksborg said that the manual locks were only to be used 
      if the others were out of order. The expert of DIS, Alve Wendt, put the 
      question to Mikael Huss, whether they had considered what would happen to 
      the ramp hinges if the vessel would proceed with fully open ramp and 15 
      kn speed against head seas? With certainty the hinges would break. M. Huss 
      replied that this had been neither considered nor calculated, although it 
      was part of their scenario. Note: See Subchapter 34.10 - The hinges would 
      break and the ramp fall off. </font></p>

      vessel upon departure from Tallinn with exception of the too weak locks.

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Seminar Organised by the 
      Royal Technical<br>
      University (KTH) Stockholm on 01.12.97 <br>
      This seminar, planned already to take place in June, had to be postponed 
      due to the delayed publication of the JAIC Report because it was practically 
      a presentation of work and results of the JAIC. Since Swedish was the main 
      language the Finnish lawyer of Messrs. Meyer Werft did attend and his report 
      reads as follows:<br>
      "The purpose of the seminar was apparently an attempt to explain for shipbuilders 
      and engineers the conclusions drawn by the JAIC in its recently published 
      report.<br>
      Among the audience one can find a number of representatives for the shipbuilding 
      and shipping industry in general, but also some insurers and lawyers.<br>
      First speaker was Ms. Ann-Louise Eksborg, recently appointed chairman of 
      the Swedish national commission. <br>
      She discussed the aims and purposes of commission work mainly from an internal 
      Swedish point of view, emphasizing the importance of the JAIC integrity 
      especially towards those authorities, who supervise the activities subject 
      to an investigation, i.e. The Board of Navigation, the Board of Aviation 
      etc. <br>
      She took it for granted, that parties subject to an investigation would 
      not participate in the work.<br>
      On my question whether she thinks these high principles were followed b 
      the JAIC she immediately grasped the purpose of the question and admitted, 
      that the Estonian members were not impartial if measured by this standard, 
      but she explained their presence in the JAIC with the allegation that apparently 
      all Estonian navigators are or have been employed by the ESCO. There should, 
      however, not remain any doubt among the audience after this answer, about 
      the fact that the JAIC was clearly prejudiced. <br>
      Tuomo Karppinen then ventured to explain the sequence of events as per the 
      JAIC's apprehension, first stating that times given have the exactness of 
      ± 2 minutes. <br>
      Karppinen then stated that some of the points of time given are more reliable 
      than others, as these can be explained by means of outside sources; such 
      are: the time of departure, the time for passing the waypoint, the time 
      for the first MayDay message and the consequent radio traffic, as well as 
      the time or the Estonia disappearing from the radar screen of the Mariella. 
      <br>
      Karppinen, however, started the summing up of the events with the "bang" 
      heard by the AB, and after that, in my opinion, all points of time are in 
      fact based on the indications given by crew members, not by the passengers. 
      Accordingly the JAIC is, albeit the point of time cannot be verified, of 
      the opinion that the events started at 00.55, that the visor locking devices 
      were broken between 1.05 and 1.10, and that the visor fell off at 1.15 with 
      immediate list as a consequence.<br>
      From the evidence recorded it is apparent, that the JAIC is not, as said, 
      attaching any greater significance to statements by passengers. <br>
      Karppinen also described the maneuvering of the vessel at this period of 
      time, i.e. the total lack of maneuvers with the exception of the fact that 
      the speed was turned down when the vessel already had a severe list. <br>
      A member of the audience very in detail expressed his opinions how a vessel 
      in a situation like this should be maneuvered, by reducing speed, turning 
      the stem/stern against the sea etc., to which Karppinen responded that obviously, 
      if the vessel had been turned such that the angle to the sea would have 
      been abt. 90 degrees, the water could not have entered through the ramp 
      at all and the vessel would have been saved. Karppinen had obvious difficulties 
      with explaining to the audience why the JAIC did not clearly say this in 
      its report. <br>
      After this discussion, there could not be any uncertainty in respect of 
      the fact that grave errors by the crew significantly contributed to, if 
      not even caused the accident." <br>
      In respect of Rahka's paper, as far as I could understand, the difference 
      in opinions between the yard/the JAIC viz. the strength calculations regarding 
      the visor locks is now being explained with reference to a turning moment 
      caused by the impact of the seas coming from abt 30 degrees to port from 
      the vessel's line of heading. <br>
      Rahka emphasized a number of times that irrespective of how the calculations 
      are made ,the locks were too weak anyhow. <br>
      Rahka denied, that the JAIC would have said that the speed was of no significance 
      at all; he (and Karppinen) stated, that a speed below 10 kn, would have 
      nullified the risk of visor failure, but the point is that speed impact 
      is linear while wave impact is proportional.<br>
      As to Huss's two papers, there was nothing extraordinary to be mentioned.<br>
      Fransson discussed the Solas requirements as to the placing of the collision 
      bulkhead extension, and concluded that the solution onboard Estonia was 
      in conflict with the applicable rules.<br>
      Much was discussed about the original approval by the FBN and subsequent 
      approvals by the BV on behalf of the Estonian BN. I did ask Fransson what 
      his opinion is about the alleged seaworthiness of the vessel at departure 
      from Tallinn, if the vessel de facto was in breach of the Solas requirements, 
      and he transferred the question to the JAIC representatives, of which Karppinen 
      ventured to answer. He said, that the seaworthiness statement in the report 
      is to be understood as a legal and formal one only! This answer no doubt 
      is the more peculiar, as the breach of the Solas requirements clearly is 
      a "formal and legal" failure, as the vessel no doubt had valid certificates.<br>
      In the end I asked Karppinen about the repair list from the Turku repairyard, 
      and the answer was that in fact this was not a quote, but a summary of the 
      items the deck officers had forwarded as a "wish", and Karppinen's rather 
      unfounded conclusion was that actually there were nothing at that time to 
      remark about the locks/hinges/packings! <br>
      He had no proper answer to the question that the list no doubt also comprised 
      items which the JAIC has chosen to mention as unrepaired, that is the packings. 
      How the JAIC has arrived at the conclusion that the remaining items were 
      not of importance or, as he is saying, did not exist, is unclear.<br>
      He did after the seminar take great pain in explaining to me that the list 
      is not an usual "to do" list, but something else, which I refused to understand. 
      <br>
      As such the seminar was interesting, but too comprehensive with too little 
      space for adequate questions; too much was packed in the program. Another 
      problem was the heterogeneous composition of the audience, a number of participants 
      with knowledge based on media information only took up the time with self-evident 
      questions.<br>
      I met afterwards Karppinen and Rahka on the airport, and we had a pleasant 
      discussion waiting for the much delayed plane.<br>
      I told them that my opinion is, that they have an uphill task in convincing 
      the interested parties in respect of the correctness of their conclusions, 
      as the JAIC in the eyes of any outsider is prejudiced, and as some conclusions, 
      such as the role of the crew, are obviously quite wrong. The two gentlemen 
      admitted the difficulties with the Estonians once more, but emphasized of 
      course the value of their own contributions. They welcomed me or my prospective 
      principals to study the background material now available at the VTT." <br>
      Nothing more remains to be done but to compare the investigation results 
      of the JAIC with those of this 'Group of Experts', which is done in Chapter 
      41. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>41.2 <br>
    Differences in Methodologies </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><br>
    When this 'Group of Experts' set out on its assigned task there was considerable 
    experience in writing and structuring of similar reports especially with Capt. 
    Hummel. But then there was the Report of the Court compiled under the direction 
    and written by the Hon. Mr. Justice Sheen on the capsizing of MV HERALD OF 
    FREE ENTERPRISE. A similar accident, brilliant in its clarity and style and 
    - so we still think - an ideal example to use. Justice Sheen in the descriptive 
    part of his Report used the "historical" method in compliance with general 
    practice in writing such reports. The facts are presented in timely order. 
    This 'Group of Experts' hence applied this method as well but adjusted it 
    as far as possible to the different methodology applied by the JAIC in the 
    compilation of their Report in order to ensure comparability of the texts 
    of both reports as best as possible. (See Subchapter 41.1.) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Report of Justice Sheen 
    sets a further example: It compiles all facts relevant to the casualty without 
    regard to source and consequences. No facts are disregarded. Facts deemed 
    relevant which however could not be clarified were clearly marked as such. 
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted this standard and attempted to adhere 
    to it to the fullest extent possible. There were however additional problems 
    in this investigation. Those who had information and knowledge pertaining 
    to the sinking of ESTONIA were often unwilling to share it with this 'Group 
    of Experts' or purposely mislead us by offering wrong information. Evidence 
    was destroyed or manipulated. This 'Group of Experts' has therefore augmented 
    the standard by the rule, that facts are only considered to be true if and 
    when they are confirmed by other information. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Last but not least Justice 
    Sheen sets a third example when he draws conclusions only that are fully supported 
    by and not in contradiction with the facts collected and found to be correct. 
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted that standard as well and complied with 
    it.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The methodology of this 
    'Group of Experts' can be summarized in three sentences: <br>
    1. Collect and describe all facts provided they pertain to the Casualty. <br>
    2. Ensure confirmation of the facts and state which relevant facts are not 
    obtainable or not ensurable.<br>
    3. Draw conclusions only provided they match with all confirmed facts. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC - according to their 
    own statements - applied a completely different methodology. They commenced 
    their work by the establishment of a hypothetical assumption of the cause 
    of the accident. Already on the 1.10.1994 Kari Lethola informed the press, 
    the JAIC strongly believed that failure of the visor caused the casualty. 
    See Subchapter 37.2 . On the 17.10 1994 the JAIC published their 2nd Interim 
    Report containing the assumption that the visor had separated from the ship 
    as a result of failure of all three locking mechanisms. When this statement 
    was made, the accident had just happened 19 days ago, the visor had not even 
    been officially located - that happened a day later - see Chapter 24 - and 
    it took another month before it was brought to the surface for inspection 
    on 18.11.1994 - See Chapter 26 - and another two weeks before it was inspected 
    on 2.12.1994 - See Subchapter 37.2. In a press release of 16.12.1994 the JAIC 
    was already able to confirm its opinion that the strength of the locking devices 
    for the bow visor in combination with the sea loads on the visor in the prevailing 
    wave condition and headway of the ship was the main cause of the accident. 
    <br>
    For investigators to work out a theoretical assumption first and then to see 
    whether the facts fit into it, is unusual because such procedure contains 
    the danger of a biased selection or treatment of facts given the nature of 
    human beings. Such method does not merit criticism however if and as long 
    as the investigators have the will and the intellectual flexibility to abandon 
    their preconceived assumptions if not all the facts fit them.<br>
    Despite numerous discussions between the members of the two investigating 
    bodies, described in detail in Subchapters 38.1 to 38.3 and the presentation 
    of new facts by this 'Group of Experts', the JAIC on 02.04.1995 published 
    its Interim Part-Report the conclusions as to the cause of the accident had 
    not changed, which did not surprise us, but we were stunned to read that the 
    findings published in this interim report 2,5 years before the publication 
    of the Final Report will remain unchanged See Subchapter 38.3. <br>
    The fact that the JAIC did not find a path out of its own prejudice was however 
    by far not the worst malpractice exercised by them in the course of their 
    investigation. Contrary to generally accepted standards again emphasized by 
    Justice Sheen the JAIC from the very beginning of its investigation destroyed 
    evidence vital to any attempt to find the actual cause for the catastrophe. 
    An outstanding example is the bolt of the Atlantic Lock. Having established 
    and published that it was the locking devices, which had failed due to faulty 
    design; the JAIC should have made every possible effort to present the essential 
    piece of evidence to prove their allegation. If nothing else fairness and 
    decency vis-à-vis the accused builder should have commanded such action leave 
    alone the order of the three Primeministers, who had founded the JAIC, to 
    find the true causes for the disaster. Given the importance of this piece 
    of evidence the reason for dumping it into the sea and thereby into oblivion 
    can only be qualified as affront: against everybody affected by the catastrophe: 
    It seemed more important to Mr. Stenström to take the ship's bell with him 
    in the helicopter and it did not appear to him that the bolt could have been 
    sent by normal surface mail if he attributed such importance to the bell. 
    For the sordid details see Chapter 27. <br>
    But evidence was not only destroyed, it was also tampered with to an extent 
    unheard of in modern history for an investigation instituted by Westeuropean 
    governments. Again one example will suffice. Reference is made to Chapter 
    34.6 where the manipulation of the underwater video-tapes is described.<br>
    As the reader might now assume evidence was also disregarded when it did not 
    fit into the hypothetical assumptions. Again just one example out of all those 
    described in the previous Chapters of Part C of this Report: The recordings 
    made with video cameras of the wreck by divers of the Swedish Navy, when they 
    surveyed it in the first days of the month of October 1994 and those of the 
    divers, who were in the wreck during the investigation of the wreck by the 
    divers of Rockwater A/S have never been presented to the public although members 
    of the JAIC were present on the diving platform at least during the inspection 
    by the divers of Rockwater A/S. See Chapter 27 and Subchapter 34.6. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>41.3<br>
  Summary </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><br>
    In comparing the two Reports the following conclusions seem appropriate:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 1. The Report of the 'German 
    Group of Experts' <br>
    Apparently this investigating body was overwhelmed by the magnitude of facts 
    they have collected in the course of their investigation. Although all these 
    facts pertain to the casualty, reading and memorizing them is a nearly impossible 
    task. The reader is therefore sometimes thankful for repetition. The Report 
    assures the reader however that no fact was "left out" whether important for 
    the conclusions or not. <br>
    The conclusion drawn on the status of the vessel when she left Tallinn on 
    her last voyage is convincing. A Passengerferry, which carries a false PSSC, 
    is open to the Sea at her bow allowing the sea to gain access to the car deck 
    uncontrolled and finally sets to sea with an unexplained list of 10 degrees 
    - imperfectly corrected by counter ballasting of the port heeling tank - which 
    was however due to a holes in the underwater hull, is unseaworthy to an extent 
    which renders this verdict undebatable. <br>
    Whether the casualty scenario complies precisely with the last chaotic minutes 
    of the vessel might be debatable. There are indications of further facts not 
    yet known or still unconfirmed which - if found correct - might necessitate 
    some change in the described scenario.<br>
    In methodology the Report complies with good practice. and is insofar based 
    on the Court Report of Justice Sheen on the Capsizing of the HERALD OF FREE 
    ENTERPRISE.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 2. The Report of The Joint 
    Accident Investigation Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden <br>
    The layout and presentation of the Report are impressive. Also here the amount 
    of facts collected is stunning but - to compare - it should be noted that 
    this Report deals with quite a few subjects, the German authors have not concerned 
    themselves with. <br>
    The casualty scenario is not convincing. It is indisputable that the ramp 
    is still fixed to the wreck. Had the ship indeed steamed against the sea with 
    her ramp resting on the forepeak deck, the ramp would no doubt have been torn 
    off by one of the first waves hitting it in that status. <br>
    The Report furthermore reveals an astonishing lack of basic knowledge of seafaring. 
    A vessel of 14,5 years of age which has been subjected to substantial strain, 
    as ferries are, does nowhere in its structure show the same criteria it had 
    as a newbuilding. Fatigue and corrosion are every vessels worst enemies. And 
    furthermore: No shipping expert puts much weight on the statements of crew 
    members after a collision or other accident for which the faulty party is 
    being sought. <br>
    There are however other problems with the JAIC Report which actually render 
    it worthless: <br>
    The first such problem is the composition of the JAIC. Member of same was 
    Mr Neidre. Mr Neidre was the head of the Navigation Department of ESCO still 
    at the time of his participation in the investigation. The investigation of 
    the activities of precisely this department in conjunction with ESTONIA was 
    one of the tasks of JAIC. Neidre therefore did indeed investigate his own 
    doings. And he kept doing so even after his dismissal, tolerated by the other 
    members of the JAIC. One of the few principles that are generally accepted 
    in democratic states is that no judge or civil servant is allowed to make 
    a decision in the exercise of the public powers vested into him/her which 
    concerns himself. Any violation of this principle renders such decision invalid 
    and subject to removal by the judiciary. <br>
    The second problem are the methods chosen by the JAIC for the treatment of 
    evidence. The destruction, manipulation and suppression of vital evidence 
    by public servants in the execution of their duties constitutes a behaviour 
    totally unacceptable in democratic societies and usually subjects the offender 
    to criminal prosecution. The evidence presented by the German 'Group of Experts' 
    for such treatment of evidence vital to the investigation into the causes 
    for the ESTONIA catastrophe is - unfortunately - overwhelming. <br>
    The two flaws in the Report of the JAIC described above disclose a third, 
    namely sloppiness. Whether the JAIC had instructions to perform an investigation 
    with predefined outcome - as is indicated by remarks of Mr. Meister and Mr. 
    Stenström - or whether they did not adhere to such instructions or - finally 
    - whether they were never given to them is irrelevant because by application 
    of due diligence owed by public servants to society the Report would have 
    been flawless in any case. As matters stand now the Report of the JAIC can 
    best be described by repetition of one phrase used by Justice Sheen in his 
    Court Report: From top to bottom the Joint Accident Investigation Commission 
    of Estonia, Finland and Sweden was infested with the disease of sloppiness. 
    It is however appropriate to add here the words "and dishonesty", because 
    the members of the JAIC knew or must have known that their sloppiness would 
    result in harm to all those affected by the catastrophe who had put such great 
    hopes on the due fulfilment of their duties by the members of the JAIC. <br>
    Despite the lack of excuse for sloppiness and dishonesty of the magnitude 
    found here, two persons bear special responsibility for the failure of the 
    investigation of the JAIC : Mr. Olof Forssberg and Mr. Kari Lethola. Both 
    are trained legal minds and have been the appointed chairmen of the official 
    accident investigation bodies in their respective countries. It seems inconceivable 
    that they could permit the work of the JAIC to be stained with the flaws described. 
    Whatever their duties were, they have both completely failed in their execution.</font></p>

    was equipped with two controllable-pitch propellers, two rudders and two bow 
    thrusters. It was designed for berthing and unberthing without external assistance. 
    Senior officers who had served on board the vessel when she was under Finnish 
    flag have generally expressed satisfaction with the handling characteristics 
    of the vessel. The fact that the navigation bridge was located aft of the 
    front bulkhead of the superstructure in such a way that the bow of the ship 
    was less visible than normal has not been considered as a disadvantage. As 
    a matter of fact, the flag mast on top of the foremost part of the visor was 
    visible from all positions aft of the control panel whilst the visor itself 
    could only be seen through the lower windows at both sides of the centre part 
    of the bridge. This, as well as the blue steering light on top of the above-mentioned 
    flag mast just shining aft are not mentioned by the JAIC at all. The drawing 
    on page 34 of the Final Report is thus incomplete and the view sector shown 
    is wrong. The correct facts are shown on page 110 above. </font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The ship had 
    a contractual speed of 21 knots at 90 per cent of maximum continuous rating. 
    The practical maximum operating speed of the ship in later years was considered 
    to be 19 knots. This was adequate for the service in which the ship was engaged. 
    To meet the timetable, the average speed in open sea was required to be about 
    17.0 knots on eastbound voyages and about 16.5 knots on westbound voyages.

  Operating Practice and Instructions </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The chief officer 
    had the responsibility for cargo handling and planning loading operations. 
    Both second officers were engaged in the actual loading and unloading on the 
    car deck and all lashing of cargo was performed under their supervision.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Besides the 
    second officers, the boatswain was directly engaged in lashing operations 
    together with the deck hands.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No standard cargo 
    loading plan was followed on board - but there was a general scheme - and 
    a sketch of the cargo allocation was made before loading started. According 
    to the JAIC the overall guidance for the lashing of the cargo, given in IMO 
    Resolution A 581 (14)<i> "Guidelines for Securing Arrange-ments for the Transport 
    of Road Vehicles on Ro-Ro Ships"</i> and in IMO Resolution A 714 (17), was 
    applied. The vessel also carried a cargo securing manual, issued by Estline, 
    which however, was not available during the inspection by the two Swedish 
    Sjöfartsverket inspectors and their trainees some hours before the last departure 
    - see Chapter 15. According to frequent travellers personal cars and vans 
    were never secured, trucks and trailers sometimes and trailers without trucks 
    mostly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the voyage 
    the cargo was checked by the seaman of the watch on his watch-round who had 
    to activate control clocks at particular check points. On the car deck there 
    were said to be one in the forward, one in the middle and one in the aft part. 
    The car deck could also be checked on monitors on the bridge and in the engine 
    control room by means of 4 cameras located forward, aft and at both sides 
    of the centre casing. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 27 September 
    1994 was the last day of ESTONIA in Tallinn and the 13th day of the current 
    14-day duty period of her crew - the Andresson crew. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before the 
    departure a crew list was handed over to the Harbour Master of Tallinn, which 
    according to a fax from Andi Meister to Hans Rosengren - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.186.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.186</a> - must have contained 187 names, i. e. 149 crew members on duty, 
    6 trainees, 4 crew members off duty and 28 advisors/ entertainers, although 
    in the fax it is stated that only 27 persons were listed on the advisors'/entertainment 
    list, but one more - Andrus Kullamaa - came on board after the master had 
    already signed the list, thus the second list should contain 186 names, but 
    187 persons were on board.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to a crew 
    list subsequently submitted by the Estonian part of the JAIC, however, actually 
    188 persons should have been on the crew lists of which 3 were not on board, 
    which reduces the number to 185, but 2 others were on board but not on the 
    lists, which increases the number to 187. Nevertheless the Estonian count 
    is 186 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.187.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.187</a> - which is not correct because the nautical adviser Juri Aavik 
    is nowhere mentioned.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> One of the crew 
    members off-duty was the master of the second crew, Avo Piht, who was on board 
    to be examined for his pilot exemption certificate when entering the Stockholm 
    archipelago at the Söderarm entrance. For this purpose the sea transport area 
    chief Dan Myrberg and the senior pilot of the Stockholm Pilots' Association 
    Karl-Gustav Sundius, together with their ladies, were also on board. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    files of the Stockholm public prosecutor there were in addition about 25-30 
    Pakistani workers and an unknown number of relatives of the crew on board 
    who were not registered anywhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding 
    of the professional background of the officers and ratings of the ESTONIA 
    some information about the history and the types of vessels used in the Estonian 
    merchant navy shall be presented at the beginning of this Chapter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1991 Estonia 
    as well as the other two Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania became independent 
    and the country received 3.2% of the tonnage of the former Soviet Russian 
    merchant navy fleet. This tonnage consisted mainly of several dozens conventional 
    type general cargo vessels which were mostly 20 or more years old, and which 
    were supplemented by 15 somewhat newer Ro-Ro/cargo vessels. A group of 6 large 
    and medium sized modern bulk carriers completed the fleet. Container- and 
    reefer-vessels as well as tankers were missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Some passenger/car 
    ferries employed mainly since 1991 demonstrate the restructuring process in 
    progress. Before the take-over of the ESTONIA in January 1993 the car/passenger 
    ferry GEORG OTTS - built for the Olympic Games in 1980 - was the largest Estonian 
    ferry</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">. All the sea-going 
    vessels were owned by the National Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) controlled 
    by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The members of the Board 
    of Directors were mainly high ranking civil servants from this Ministry while 
    the management consisted of previous master mariners of Estonian nationality 
    but with Russian education at the Leningrad Maritime Academy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the following 
    the vessels on which ESTONIA's first and last master, Captain Arvo Andresson, 
    obtained most of his sea-going experience, shall be introduced:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary the following 
    can be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The master and 
    senior officers received their basic education at the Leningrad Maritime Academy, 
    an Institute which is not known to impress upon its students to act and decide 
    on their own.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The juniors, 
    Tammes and Kikas, were educated in Kotka and Tallinn after the political change.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note</b>: As 
      will be seen later, it was Tammes who took the lead in the transmission 
      of the 'Mayday' calls after Ainsalu had almost spoiled the situation, and 
      although he was not on watch, he had apparently returned to the bridge on 
      his own initiative.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>Captain Arvo 
    Andresson</b> spent 101/2 of his 201/2 years at sea on a vessel of the ANTSLA 
    type, which is an old conventional cargo vessel, furthermore he was employed 
    on board of GEORG OTTS as 2nd officer for 17 months, as chief officer for 
    5 months and as master for 4 months, before he took over the ESTONIA in January 
    1993. The car/passenger ferry GEORG OTTS was exclusively employed between 
    Tallinn and Helsinki, i.e. she sailed no more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land "in sheltered waters". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    - <b>Chief officer Juhan Herma</b> had only been at sea <b>for 5 years </b>in 
    total, of which 10 months on a cargo vessel and 16 months on GEORG OTTS as 
    4th and 3rd officer, whereafter he left ESCO and sailed on INREKO ships from 
    February 1993 until August 1994 - according to the statement of ESCO - although 
    at the same time he was already 2nd officer on ESTONIA, which, of course, 
    is not possible, thus there must be something wrong.<i> Only in September 
    1994, thus shortly before the casualty, did he become chief officer. </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">-<b> 2nd officer 
    Tormi Ainsalu</b> had been at sea for 51/2 years only, of which 21/2 years 
    as sailor and 3 years as officer, 6 months of which he had been on GEORG OTTS 
    as 2nd officer before he joined ESTONIA in January 1993.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- <b>2nd officer 
    Peeter Kannussaar</b> had been at sea <b>for 3 years </b>only, of which for 
    1 year he was employed on an unknown vessel as 3rd officer and for 3 months 
    as 2nd officer on GEORG OTTS before he joined the ESTONIA in January 1993.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>3rd officer 
    Andres Tammes</b> had been at sea for <b>only 2 years</b> and 4 months as 
    sailor on a Ro-Ro cargo vessel, whereafter he attended the Kotka Marine School 
    for 2 years and signed on ESTONIA in January 1993 as 4th officer and had been 
    3rd officer since May 1994. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- <b>4th officer 
    Kaimar Kikas</b>, finally, was only 21 years old. His first and only ship 
    was the ESTONIA. He was employed for the first 12 months as AB and became 
    4th officer in January 1994.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above evaluation 
    reveals that master and senior officers were Russian educated, that only the 
    master had spent some considerable time at sea, however, that also his experience 
    with car/passenger ferries was restricted to the GEORG OTTS employed between 
    Helsinki and Tallinn, which is in no way comparable to the Tallinn-Stockholm 
    trade with ESTONIA. The chief officer as well as 2nd officer A - Tormi Ainsalu 
    - had been at sea each for about 5 years only with 16 months respectively 
    6 months on GEORG OTTS as the only car/passenger ferry experience, whilst 
    the 2nd officer B - Peeter Kannussaar - had just 3 years at sea, of which 
    3 months on GEORG OTTS before he joined ESTONIA. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be 
    concluded that neither the master nor the nautical officers had had any previous 
    experience with a comparable vessel when they joined the ESTONIA and that 
    the only one with considerable sea experience was Captain Arvo Andresson, 
    whilst all the others, including the chief officer and the 2nd officer A, 
    could only be considered junior officers. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On 27 September 
    1994 ESTONIA was lying at her berth in Tallinn with open visor and open bow 
    ramp, whilst the crew was carrying out some maintenance work and was preparing 
    her for the take-over of passengers, cars, trucks, and trailers in the late 
    afternoon.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> While a number of 
    deckhands were clearing up and cleaning the car deck, provisions and stores 
    were taken over and brought down to the provision area on the 1st deck by 
    means of the big lift at the aft end of the centre casing. At the same time 
    one AB was painting the port anchor from a cherry picker standing on the open 
    bow ramp. Even in summer the port anchor with pocket had to be painted quite 
    often as the anchor was frequently used during berthing manoeuvres at Tallinn 
    when Captain Arvo Andresson was in charge, who was still unable to manoeuvre 
    the big vessel the way his colleagues in Finland and Sweden had done during 
    the past 14 years without problems.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other AB's were 
    painting in the forepart of the car deck near the control panel for visor 
    and bow ramp and the upper flaps of the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At noon two representatives 
    from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, chief inspectors <b>Åke Sjöblom</b> and <b>Gunnar 
    Zahlée</b>, came on board together with a group of nine high ranking officials 
    in Estonian Ship Safety, who were to be trained in Port State Control matters. 
    ESTONIA was selected to be the test vessel for this day (see details in the 
    following Chapter 15). <b>Captain Andresson</b> was said to be ashore, thus 
    the chief mate <b>Juhan Herma</b> and the chief engineer <b>Lembit Leiger</b> 
    were in charge of the ferry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most of the passengers 
    who returned with the ferry to Stockholm the same evening were ashore on sightseeing 
    tours whilst others attended on board seminars and did not go ashore at all. 
    Among them was a group of Statoil Sweden employees and a group of 68 police 
    civil servants belonging to the ST section of the Stockholm police. The seniors 
    of this group had cabins on the outer and inner side of deck 6 while others 
    were staying in cabins of the 5th and 4th decks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two members of another 
    group, <b>Rolf Sörman </b>and <b>Nebosja Grkovic</b> - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.335.1</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.348.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.4.348</a> - had returned from shore early and were having their lunch 
    in the restaurant "Poseidon" in the aft part of deck 6. They observed six 
    or seven persons at the big table in the centre, one of whom was the master 
    of the second crew, <b>Captain Avo Piht</b>. Another one was an officer wearing 
    a blue uniform. Furthermore there were two ladies and two gentlemen in civil 
    clothes probably the two Stockholm pilots with their ladies. There was a friendly 
    atmosphere. A walky-talky was standing upright on the table and was obviously 
    turned on channel 16 because they heard a gale warning in English. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the new passengers 
    coming on board in the course of the afternoon was the weapons dealer <b>Alexander 
    Vorodin</b>, his father-in-law <b>Vasili Krjutjkov</b>, and his cousin <b>Vassili 
    Vorodin</b>, who received either cabin 6320 or 6230. This is of some importance 
    because later, during the diving survey in December 1994, the suitcase of<b> 
    Alexander Vorodin </b>was taken out of cabin 6230 by a diver. It was the second 
    cabin on the port side in front of deck 6 which however - according to the 
    survivor purser<b> Andres Vihmar </b>- had been assigned to <b>Captain Avo 
    Piht</b>. - See Andres Vihmar's statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.195</a> . On the other hand, <b>Vasili Krjutjkov </b>did testify in his 
    first statement - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.196</a> that their cabin had been 6230 and only in his subsequent statement 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.197.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.197</a> - said, it had been 6320 while his nephew <b>Vassili Vorodin</b> 
    stated that they had looked out of the window after the abrupt starboard heel. 
    This would not have been possible from cabin 6320 which was an inside cabin 
    without windows. Thus it has to be assumed that the Vorodins were in cabin 
    6230.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the Swedish 
    press photographer<b> Håkan Isefjord </b>came on board with his camera equipment, 
    of which he should later hide one camera with 2 films in lifeboat no. 9 which 
    was the last lifeboat on the starboard side of ESTONIA. When the lifeboat 
    was found several days after the casualty on the Estonian north coast the 
    camera, with two films, was found jammed inside the lifeboat and subsequently 
    delivered to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from where it was sent by diplomatic 
    mail to Stockholm. According to the files of the public prosecutor the films, 
    however, were not in the camera anymore.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another passenger 
    was the auditor <b>Peeter Riit </b>who reportedly came on board rather late 
    since he had missed the last plane to Stockholm and therefore took the ferry. 
    <b>Peeter Riit</b> was employed by the Stockholm auditors KPMG who had been 
    instructed by N&T to examine the books of Estline, Tallinn. Reportedly <b>Peeter 
    Riit </b>had completed this job on 27 September 1994 and was now on his way 
    back to Stockholm with a number of, for ESCO, rather damaging documents.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the passengers 
    were also a considerable number of businessmen, such as <b>Per-Erik Ehrnsten, 
    Carl Övberg</b> and <b>Tony Spuhl</b>, who had made many previous voyages 
    on board the ferry and thus knew the vessel and crew quite well, which also 
    goes for many truck drivers who came up to the Reception Desk after having 
    driven their trucks on to the car deck and were shown to cabins on the 4th 
    deck reserved for truck drivers only. Most of them sensed a certain state 
    of nervousness with the crew members they met which they had never done before 
    on the many earlier voyages.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason for this 
    certain nervousness of some of the crew members could have been the attempt 
    of the Swedish Safety Inspector<b> Åke Sjöblom </b>to stop the ferry from 
    departing which was certainly realised by some crew members and then quickly 
    spread around. </font></p>

  AND THEIR TRAINEES</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In accordance 
    with the treaty between the Swedish and the Estonian Goverments "Maritime 
    Transport and Safety at Sea and Prevention from Pollution on Marine Environment 
    Projects, Phase IV", signed 03.02.93, the Swedish Sjöfartsverket had sold 
    an education package to the Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B) which 
    was paid for by the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS) 
    and which, among other things, required Sjöfartsverket to train and educate 
    Estonian master mariners and engineers employed with the E.N.M.B. to carry 
    out Port State Control (PSC) surveys on own and foreign vessels and to issue 
    the respective certificates. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In Annex A of the 
    treaty the "Scope of Services" is outlined and with reference to "Port State 
    Control" (PSC) the following is explained:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Brush-up seminars 
      and <b>on the job training </b>for ship inspectors in Tallinn, implementing 
      the Port State Control methodology. <b>The training will be carried out 
      in Tallinn.</b>«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In Annex B the obligations 
    of the Estonian side are specified. Under item 7 it is stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»To provide 
      all necessary permits, including facilitation of visa formalities and <b>authorisations 
      for the carrying out of the services.</b>«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 02.02.94 the 
    board of BITS agreed to provide the required amount of SEK 574.340,--. The 
    respective agreement contains the following definition in respect of PSC:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The training 
      will be performed in Estonia in one-week seminars for 8-14 participants 
      in accordance with international standards. The seminars include <b>on-the-job 
      training, i.e. in practice actual inspections of vessels in international 
      trade. Our inspectors do expect participants from the E.N.M.B., those responsible 
      for PSC in Tallinn as well as those responsible for safety in ESCO.«</b></i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is revealed from 
    the above that the Estonian authorities did initiate and order the advisory 
    services of Sjöfartsverket. As regards the PSC these services should consist 
    of<b> on-the-job training and actual inspections</b> on board of vessels employed 
    in international trade <b>in the port of Tallinn</b>. According to the treaty 
    the <b>Estonians were obliged to authorise the Swedish inspectors properly 
    for this job.<br>
    </b>This could only mean that in the light of the treaty and also through 
    the confirmation by the board of BITS, these <b>on-the-job inspections were 
    considered to be normal PSC inspections by properly authorised inspectors.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the 
    legal background for these inspections - the SOLAS 1974 Convention and the 
    Paris Memorandum of Understanding - the Paris MOU - reference is made to the 
    report of the Independent Fact Group, Stockholm about the <i>"Forgery of Documents 
    to hide the initial Unseaworthiness of the 'Estonia' "</i>, which is attached

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The task to 
    train the Estonians was assigned to the Shipinspec office Malmö headed by 
    chief inspector Åke Sjöblom. With regard to this project he reported to Willand 
    Ringborg of International Projects at the head office of Sjöfartsverket (HK 
    = Huved Kontor = head office) at Norrköping. (See also Subchapter 6.3.1.)<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In compliance 
    with the agreed training program chief inspector Åke Sjöblom and inspector 
    Gunnar Zahlée travelled to Tallinn on 26 September 1994 and met their high 
    ranking Estonian trainees on the morning of the 27th at the offices of the 
    Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.). These were according to the draft 
    report of Åke Sjöblom:</font></p>

    Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée were heard by the Estonian Security Police in 
    their hotel during the night 28/29 September 1994. The statements are not 
    available.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The statement of 
    Ulf Beijner is, however, available. He has testified that at a confidential 
    meeting at the Sjöfartsverket's head office about 10 days after the casualty 
    Åke Sjöblom explained what they had really found on board the ESTONIA, viz. 
    the absolutely disastrous condition of the bow ramp, the mattresses, blankets 
    and rugs plugged into the gap at the lower corner in way of the severely damaged 
    port hinges, where the bow ramp was already detached from the vessel. Further 
    that they had consequently demanded from their highest ranking trainee, the 
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the E.N.B.M., Arne Valgma, that the 
    ferry should under no circumstances sail in this condition, which was said 
    to have been rejected by him and subsequently by the Estonian authorities 
    up to the highest level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above has been 
    confirmed by a colleague of Ulf Beijner, the next-in-charge of another district, 
    who added that Åke Sjöblom then - after the Estonians had rejected to stop 
    the ferry - spoke first to his direct superior, Sea Safety Director Bengt-Erik 
    Stenmark, who felt unable to do anything because they had no authority in 
    Tallinn, and subsequently, to the General Director of Sjöfartsverket, Kaj 
    Janérus, who felt also unable to do anything to stop the ferry. The result 
    is well known and 8 hours later the ESTONIA was down at the bottom of the 
    sea and about 1000 people had lost their lives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The available information 
    and documentation shall now be discussed in detail, always with reference 
    to the Report of the Independent Fact Group - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.1.429.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.1.429</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The task of chief 
    inspector Åke Sjöblom and inspector Gunnar Zahlée was to demonstrate to a 
    rather high ranking group of Estonian Ship Safety officials, among them the 
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the Estonian National Maritime Board, 
    Sea Safety Director Arne Valgma, the meaning and importance of Port State 
    Control inspections. The test object was ESTONIA, believed by the Estonian 
    trainees to be the best vessel of the Estonian merchant navy fleet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At the end of the 
    inspection a "Report of Inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding 
    on Port State Control" was jointly drawn up on a Sjöfartsverket form - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 15.200</a> 
    - which is frequently referred to and of which apparently several versions 
    do exist, because according to Arne Valgma's testimony to the police - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.204.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 15.204</a> 
    - there were only eight items noted on this document which was signed by himself 
    and he expressly confirmed that it did conform with their real findings and 
    that no other defects were noted. He declared further that of these eight 
    items, six were coded 99, i.e. could be rectified subsequently and only two 
    were coded 17, i.e. to be rectified before departure and this was just the 
    replacement of a wing screw from a galley window on the 7th deck and the closing 
    of two covers on car deck. This document is not available to this 'Group of 
    Experts'. The number and status of crucial items look quite different in the 
    "Report of Inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on 
    Port State Control" (hereafter called "The Report of Inspection") which was 
    submitted by Åke Sjöblom to the JAIC (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.200</a>) and which contains in total 15 items including the eight mentioned 
    by Arne Valgma in his statement and which is also signed by Arne Valgma, although 
    this "Report of Inspection" is on a form of the National Maritime Administration 
    (of Sweden). The additional items are</font></p>

    before departure and if that could not have been achieved by the crew, the 
    ferry mandatorily should have stayed in port until all items had been rectified 
    to the satisfaction of the authorities. This is the reason why Arne Valgma 
    tried to play down the problems discovered on board and testified wrongly 
    and incompletely to the criminal police and, in addition, committed forgery

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Åke Sjöblom was interviewed 
    in February 1998, after the prosecutor had been in Papenburg, and stated the 
    following:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- it had just 
    been for training purposes, thus no valid PSC;</b> <br>
    - visor and bow ramp were open;<br>

    down somewhat but could still be closed and locked properly; <br>
    </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- it 
    is likely that during opening and closing there might have been a squeaking 
    sound, this, however, is no reason to question in hindsight the functioning 
    of the visor and locking devices.<br>
    </font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- To the 
    question: "<i>Did you try to stop the vessel from leaving Tallinn?</i>", he 
    replied: "<i>I have never said that I had tried to stop the vessel.<b> I had 
    no chance to stop it since it was an exercise and not a Port State Control</b></i><b>."</b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    aforementioned it has to be concluded that two top inspectors from the Swedish 
    Sjöfartsverket and nine (or ten) of the highest ranking government civil servants 
    from Estonian Ship Safety had inspected the ESTONIA during the afternoon before 
    her last departure from Tallinn for ca. 4-6 hours. They were accompanied by 
    her chief officer and her chief engineer when they made the relevant observations 
    which they have commented as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The<b> documentation</b> 
    was not to their satisfaction because:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the <b>safety 
      plan</b> and <b>muster list</b> were not according to regulation;<br>
      - the chief officer could not show them the<b> damage control plan</b> nor 
      could he show the <b>cargo securing manual; </b><br>
      - the chief officer could not submit the<b> stability booklet </b>and <b>did 
      not know where to search for it; <br>

      - the chief officer was<b> unable to read a damage control plan;</b><br>

      </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      the exemption certificate for liferafts was missing. </font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary they concluded 
    that the chief officer, who was the acting commanding officer since the master 
    was ashore, could not show them any of the relevant documents/certificates 
    and did not give them an explanation for this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(b) The mimic 
    panel on the bridge:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- the chief officer 
    did not really know which light meant open and which meant closed.</b><br>
    - he was of the opinion that the<b> green light meant "closed", although actually 
    it meant "open". </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(c) The watertight 
    doors and the fire doors:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - there was a problem 
    in way of the <b>galley where they had completely sabotaged the fire protection;</b><br>
    - in the area of the <b>boiler room nothing fitted at all. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(d) Lack of respect 
    for load line matters was noted on the car deck and in way of bow ramp/visor:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>hatch covers 
    were found open which should have been mandatorily closed,</b> but had been 
    open for the last one or two years (in two or three places). <br>
    - there was <b>big damage to the rubber packings of the visor in the "corners 
    of the mouth", </b>it was clear mechanical wear, about 0,5 m each side, it 
    can never have been tight the way it looked.<br>
    - there was also<b> some form of mechanical damage (to the visor) which indicated 
    that something did not fit properly.</b><br>
    - it looked as if <b>the visor did not fit anymore correctly</b>, perhaps 
    it could be <b>compared</b> to a <b>misaligned car door which was hanging 
    down some-what, but still could be closed and locked properly.</b><br>
    - they knew that <b>B.V. had written recommendations</b> about one month before, 
    <b>but the chief officer knew absolutely nothing about them and he was the 
    commanding officer. </b><br>
    - they were particularly dissatisfied with the visor and said so to the chief 
    officer,<b> they had the impression that there was a lack of respect for load 
    line matters.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    written recommendations by B.V. issued about one month before, i.e. probably 
    on 25.08.94, are unknown and are neither mentioned in the Final Report of

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(e) Stability 
    calculations:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - they asked the 
    chief officer:<i> "Who carries out the stability calculations before departure?"</i>, 
    and he replied: <i>"The 2nd officer."</i> They waited for him but he never 
    showed up, which concerned them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(f) Cargo securing 
    devices:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - they found some 
    <b>cargo securing devices defect </b>and asked the chief officer whether he 
    would ever use them and he replied: <b><i>"If necessary."</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(g) The chief 
    officer and the crew in general: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- they <b>formulated 
    their findings</b> in each case so it was at least assured that they had drawn 
    attention to it and<b> left it with the commanding officer</b>. They had the 
    impression, however, that the <b>endeavours on board in this respect remained 
    limited. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Sjöfartsverket 
    inspectors finalised their comments by stating that: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Before the 
      background of what has happened, it is, of course, natural that also we 
      make a connection of certain things. But it is a fact that we had formulated 
      exactly: "We have seen a lack of respect for load line matters", and with 
      this we were particularly very dissatisfied.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In a subsequent 
    phone call Åke Sjöblom told Bengt Schager, the psychological expert of the 
    Swedish Commission, that the crew on board the ESTONIA was the worst he had 
    ever met in his long years of experience. On the other hand, Åke Sjöblom does 
    not create the impression that he has a bad conscience or feels guilty, which 
    is obviously due to the fact that he had tried whatever was in his powers 
    to stop the ferry from departing which, however, was in vain. Contrary to 
    Arne Valgma, who could have stopped the ferry, Åke Sjöblom indeed could have 
    done no more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be concluded here, that it is quite obvious that the Sjöfartsverket's inspectors 
    had found the ESTONIA to be unseaworthy in several respects and consequently 
    had done their utmost to avoid her departure which, however, had been in vain 
    since they did not have the authority to enforce this, although they should 
    have according to the treaty and the BITS agreement. See page 355. After the 
    casualty up to day everything has been done to keep this matter, with the 
    consent and assistance of the JAIC, unex-plained. It is for this reason that 
    the Swedish side and, in particular, Åke Sjöblom have emphasised time and 
    again that the inspection was not a proper PSC but just on-the-job training, 
    while the Estonian side, up to Minister level, still stresses that it was 
    a valid PSC and that the vessel had been found to be seaworthy otherwise she 
    would not have been permitted to sail. </font></p>

      small cross-flooding valve between the heeling tanks.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason why the 
    PSSC was issued wrongly was the fact that the vessel did not comply with the 
    requirements of SOLAS 1974 for the "intended trade", i.e. proceeded more than 
    20 nm from the nearest land, as stated annually in the "Survey Report for 
    the Issue for PSSC - Clause 1 - General Information" and, thus, the bow ramp 
    plus front bulkheads, as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck = car deck, were ca. 5.8 m too much forward (see Subchapter 2.4.4 above). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last issued L.L. 
    Certificate had already expired on 11.09.94 and apparently a further interim 
    one had not been issued by B.V. for reasons unknown to this 'Group of Experts'. 
    In any event, according to the certificates issued after the surveys carried 
    out between the 23-25 August 1994 by Anders Wirstam, the Load Line Survey 
    was apparently carried out and Annex A - to Report No. STK/94/77E - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.206.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    16.1.206</a> - was filled out although, as it looks, no new Interim L.L. Certificate 
    had been issued by the time of the casualty. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">This was, at least, the 
    situation in October/November 1994, since it has to be assumed that N&T would 
    have submitted the L.L. Certificate valid at the time of sinking, had they 
    had it. However, when the Final Report of the Joint Accident Investigation 
    Commission was published, it was most surprising to note that they stated 
    on page 46, item 3.6.2 that there had been a valid L.L. Certificate issued 
    on 9 September 1994. In any event, also this certificate was issued falsely 
    because visor and bow ramp had been leaking for many months before the casualty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Based on the status of the 
    class and safety certificates only, it could be assumed that the vessel ESTONIA 
    was in an acceptable condition when she departed from Tallinn on 27 September 
    1994. This, however, was definitely not the case as will be demonstrated in 
    the following subchapters</font>.</p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the information 
    contained in the previous chapters 3.5 and 12 regarding the vessel's performance 
    until 27 September 1994, in particular the various observations of passengers, 
    crew members and other persons on or from the car deck or other decks of the

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This conclusion 
    is in direct contradiction to the statements made by Bureau Veritas in the 
    many certificates issued by them in respect of all the safety relevant parts

    have been issued.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In detail:<br>
    The problems with the visor were initiated by two different circumstances, 
    viz. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- severe structural damage 
    caused by proceeding through heavy ice at excessive speed.<br>
    - the decision of the Technical Managers, N&T, not to renew the rubber packings, 
    assuring weather(water-)tightness of the visor and preventing the visor from 
    vibrating and thereby avoiding cracks emanating therefrom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Structural damage:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The shell plating 
    as well as the internals are very severely damaged in two places, viz. there 
    is a deep vertical indentation in the bow leading upwards from the stempost 
    for about 2 m, as can be seen on the picture below from the outside,</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg385.jpg" width="252" height="218"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The arrow points 
    to the deep indentation which is completely painted and the paint does not 
    show contact marks. The following photos showing the inside of the same area 
    do confirm the deep indentation in a very strong part of the visor to be of 
    old origin. </font></p>

  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Furthermore, the 
    shell plating as well as the 3rd stringer at the port side are severely indented 
    and set up with the frames buckled which had been sustained already some time 
    before the casualty. - See the pictures above.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The condition of 
    the visor bottom with stempost is evident from the picture below taken on 
    30.08.94.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg387.jpg" width="405" height="372"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 1</b> - 
    Indentation in the foremost part of the visor bottom indicating that the visor's 
    initial position was changed to forward most probably due to misalignment 
    of the whole structure. This led to contact between the visor bottom and the 
    stempost on the forepeak deck. Since the visor bottom in this area is not 
    constructed to take up load, the bottom became indented and cracked. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 2</b> - 
    Indicates a cracked welding seam through which water penetrated and created 
    the rust stripes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 3 </b>- 
    Indicates transverse cracks in the visor bottom in way of the contact area 
    with the starboard steel pad welded to the forepeak deck and which should 
    take up about 10% of the visor's weight in closed condition. Since the corresponding 
    port side is not affected at all, it has to be assumed that the starboard 
    side absorbs all the weight which is another indication for the complete misalignment 
    of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Arrow 4 </b>- 
    Indicates a further probably cracked area.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    above it has to be concluded that the visor was completely misaligned in longitudinal, 
    transverse and vertical direction which led to considerable problems during 
    opening and closing. These problems increased all the more as time went by 
    as confirmed by the many observations, e.g. of previous passengers, in particular 
    the truck drivers having spent hours on the car deck waiting for the crew 
    to be able to open the visor (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The difficulties 
    with the visor are also confirmed by previous crew members and pilots having 
    observed the frequent opening and violent closing until the locating horn 
    on the forepeak deck (pyramid) finally fitted into the mating pocket in the 
    visor bottom (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Consequences of 
    the misaligned visor</b><br>
    Due to the increasing misalignment it was at first difficult to close the 
    locking devices and subsequently to open them. <br>
    Reportedly it had not been possible to open and close the <b>Atlantic lock</b> 
    hydraulically for several months prior to the casualty and the crew members 
    had to go inside the visor before arrival and after departure from Tallinn 
    and hammer open respectively closed the bolt of the Atlantic lock which, among 
    other things affected the load-carrying capacity of the lugs. Also the <b>hydraulic 
    side locks </b>were difficult to close and subsequently to open. Reportedly 
    on many occasions after arrival in Tallinn the lugs had to be cut off the 
    visor by flame-cutting to be able to open the visor. Subsequently the lugs 
    were rewelded to the visor bulkheads which continuously reduced the load-carrying 
    capacity of these lugs (see Subchapter 12.4.3. and Chapter 30).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Obviously also 
    the <b>visor hinges</b> had become affected because on 17 September 1994, 
    i.e. 10 days before the last departure, a passenger filmed the visor and, 
    in particular, the starboard visor hinges in Tallinn during the closing procedure.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The passenger 
    was standing in front of deck 7 and filmed the closing of the visor, finally 
    zooming in on the starboard hinges. The video-prints below are part of the 
    film. Picture 2 is an enlargement of Picture 1.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On Picture 2 there 
    are obviously several major deficiencies visible, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the gap between 
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (arrow 
    1). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the outer bushing 
    is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (arrow 2) [which 
    explains the large gap mentioned above]. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) the lower part 
    of outer bushing is missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the securing 
    plate is missing and the outer end of the bolt is not visible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) the outer bushing 
    appears to be twisted anti-clockwise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) the inner bushing 
    appears to be twisted clockwise.<br>
    See also Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 and Chapter 30. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates 
    that the steel- and bronze-bushings of the starboard visor hinge arrangement 
    had been replaced some time ago in a very unpro-fessional way with an extremely 
    poor standard of workmanship.<br>
    Also the member of a working team, the nautical student Rain Oolmets, who 
    stayed on board from 15 July to 11 September 1994, had discovered cracks in 
    the welding seams up to 10 cm long between the steel bushings and the visor 
    hinge plates of the port and starboard visor hinge arrangements which underlines 
    the generally poor condition of these safety relevant components. See Subchapter 
    12.5.<br>
    It is obvious from the above description of the visible deficiencies that 
    the <b>condition of the visor hinges rendered the vessel already initially 
    unseaworthy. </b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Consequences of 
    missing rubber packings<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last 
    Finnish crew had requested the renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of 
    the visor for the then planned yard time in January 1993, because the rubber 
    packing had last been renewed in January 1991. This meant a renewal of the 
    entire packing on the forepeak deck plus about 2 m up each front bulkhead 
    as demonstrated by the following drawing. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg392.jpg" width="371" height="457"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the new technical 
    managers N&T were of the opinion that visors are full of water at sea anyway, 
    the rubber packings were not renewed in January 1993 and also not later. This 
    means that the visor became quickly filled up with water at sea up to the 
    height of the outside water level. In calm sea it was the height of the bow 
    wave which filled the visor up to the 3rd stringer, however, the worse the 
    weather was and the deeper the bow was diving into the waves, the higher the 
    water rose inside the visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following 
    picture shows the ESTONIA in Tallinn, with open visor but closed bow ramp 
    so that the otherwise invisible underside of the bow ramp is shown with the 
    lowest section being dark - see arrow. Doubtless this was caused by the water 
    inside the visor with hydraulic oil from the leaking cylinders swimming on 
    top of the water surface. When the vessel reduced speed and the bow wave became 
    smaller and finally disappeared completely when the vessel was alongside, 
    the water streamed out of the visor and the oil settled everywhere inside 
    the visor, also on the bow ramp which forms the aft inside of the visor. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water streaming 
    out of the visor was observed by many passengers when the vessel was alongside 
    in Stockholm with closed visor and, among others, also by the skipper of the 
    Sandhamn pilot boat as well as by several pilots when the ferry was</font> 
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">slowing down during 
    the approach to the pilot boat. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg393.jpg" width="375" height="249"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bow wave became 
    smaller and the water streamed at once out of the visor. (See Subchapter 12.4.4.) 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious 
    that at sea inside the visor the conditions in a partly filled ballast water 
    tank did exist with resultant sloshing effects causing additional loads on 
    hinges and locking devices and vibrations to the whole visor, the consequences 
    of which are described in Subchapter 34.3.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(2) The bow ramp, 
    its locking devices, hinges and rubber packings:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The<b> 
    bow ramp</b> was part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    bulkhead deck and as such had to be mandatorily watertight based on the stringent 
    requirements of SOLAS 1974. This, however, was obviously not the case because 
    back to December 1993 there is reliable evidence that frequently there had 
    been a lot of water on the car deck - see Subchapter 12.4.4. There is also 
    a lot of evidence that the bow ramp was severely misaligned and - in fact 
    - was no more connected to the port outer and probably also inner hinges for 
    some time - see Subchapter 12.4.3. It has thus to be assumed that the water 
    penetrated onto the car deck from the visor, which was filled up to the outside 
    water level, as soon as the vessel was on full speed and the bow wave had 
    risen to ca. 2.5 m height. Since even in calm sea the visor was filled above 
    the level of the 3rd stringer, which is above the car deck level, it is apparent 
    that even in good weather conditions water was streaming onto the car deck. 
    Most of it was most probably absorbed by the 12 scuppers at each side, some 
    of which, however, were reportedly always blocked by stones and other debris.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    <b>Consequently it has to be assumed that there was already a deadly connection 
    between the always water-filled and -refilled visor and the large, open car 
    deck via the open port lower </b>edge of the bow ramp since some time before 
    the last departure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The <b>locking devices 
    of the bow ramp</b> were difficult to lock and, once locked, even more difficult 
    to unlock. There is lots of evidence from truck drivers and other passengers 
    having waited for hours on the car deck watching the fruitless attempts to 
    open respectively close the securing bolts hydraulically and, finally, watching 
    them being opened by flame cutting of the upper parts of the mating boxes, 
    which should have been subsequently rewelded but frequently were not. When 
    the crew did not succeed in closing the bolts hydraulically, they tried it 
    by hammering, even by using sledge-hammers and very often gave up, i.e. the 
    ramp remained - at least partly - unsecured! (See Subchapters 12.4.3 / 12.4.5.)<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this led, 
    of course, in time to a considerable reduction of the load-carrying capacity 
    similar as with the hydraulic side locks of the visor. Also <b>the hinges 
    of the bow ramp </b>were severely affected, in particular the <b>port outer 
    hinge</b>. This very heavy hinge arrangement was already damaged before the 
    vessel was taken over by her new owners in January 1993, because the old Finnish 
    crew had already requested renewal at the planned yard time in January 1993 
    - see Subchapter 6.5.1. Nothing was done by N&T and since the mates of the 
    ESTONIA performed the loading and discharging of the cars and trucks reportedly 
    rather carelessly, the vessel very often had a list during loading or unloading 
    which finally broke the port hinge completely according to the report of a 
    truck driver being an eye witness. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The crew had 
    severe problems to lift up the ramp at all which was only possible after some 
    temporary measurements had been carried out. Ever since, the misalignment 
    of the ramp increased visibly and the problems were growing daily.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>rubber 
    packings</b> around the car deck opening, which should be sealed tight by 
    a properly closed and locked bow ramp, apparently did no more seal watertight 
    since some considerable time already, because the last Finnish crew had ordered<b> 
    10 m of rubber packing to be renewed </b>at the next yard time which was planned 
    for January 1993 - see Subchapter 3.4. - as mentioned before. This was more 
    than half of the total length of the rubber packings, but also these packings 
    were never renewed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE LOADING AND SECURING 
  OF THE CARGO</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>17.1<br>
  The Loading</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The loading 
    commenced at about 17.00 hours and was supervised by the 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu 
    assisted by some of the deckhands, such as Valdur Matt, Arne Koppel, Aulis 
    Lee and others. Subsequently also the trainee mate Einar Kukk attended.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    surviving crew members having worked on the car deck, the hanging decks had 
    not been in use and the car deck had been full with trucks and cars. Directly 
    in front of the centre casing there had been 2 garbage containers standing 
    one in back of the other towards the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The available <b>cargo 
    documentation</b> consists of the <b>cargo manifest</b> which was received 
    from the Joint Accident Investigation Commission in the early days of the 
    investigation and was said to reflect the description and numbers of trucks/trailers 
    actually loaded, see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.211</a>. Only recently the<b> freight manifest</b> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.212.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.212</a> - and the<b> customs list</b> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.213.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.213</a> - were received.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Both the cargo manifest 
    and the freight manifest initially contained 38 trucks - although in the consecutive 
    numbering a 39th and 40th truck had been included, of which the 39th was added 
    in handwriting on both manifests. The recently received customs list however 
    reveals that there were actually 40 trucks and trailers loaded. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    customs list the 40th truck, missing on the cargo manifest although the consecutive 
    number on the manifest - 43 744 - had been left open, was a Scania truck with 
    the registration no. AG 565 and with the Latvian driver Gunnar Gobins ((). 
    Since the customs list does not state dimen-sions, weight or type of cargo, 
    no more details are known. The 39th truck added to the cargo manifest in handwriting 
    under the consecutive no. 43 749 was also a Scania truck with the registration 
    no. NRY 806 and with the Swedish driver Leo Sillanpää ((). In the freight 
    manifest - Enclosure 17.1.212 - which is the cargo manifest with added freight 
    figures, both trucks are missing although the consecutive numbers 43 744 and 
    43 749 were left open. It is unknown whether this means that these trucks 
    were carried free of charge and whether this could mean that these are the 
    two trucks escorted into the port and on board by military personnel. (See 
    Subchapter 17.3.)</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> According 
      to information received from a prisoner in the jail of Vaasa/ Finland (after 
      the Luttunen interview) his friend Leo Sillanpää was the driver of a truck 
      which had plutonium hidden between the regular cargo.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is also evident 
    from the customs list that the truck or trailer no. 46 with the number plate 
    417 EEE had no driver registered. It is thus possible that this was the truck 
    or trailer which had been shipped on board the ESTONIA on the basis of incorrect 
    documents and which contained between 148 and 174 Iraqi Kurds according to 
    information from the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, Stockholm. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    statement of an Estonian lawyer, someone from Estline, Stockholm flew to Tallinn 
    by the first plane on the morning of the catastrophe, collected all the cargo 
    and passenger documentation available and flew back by next plane to Stockholm, 
    whereafter the cargo manifest was made up. According to other sources the 
    Estonian Security Police collected already in the early morning hours of the 
    28th the complete cargo documentation from the Estline office in Tallinn. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible customs 
    chief of Frihamn Terminal, Stockholm told Spiegel TV that they had always 
    received the cargo manifest on the evening of the departure by fax, which, 
    however, had not been the case on the evening of 27 September 1994. Even after 
    several reminders they received the cargo manifest only in the afternoon of 
    28 September 1994 from Estline, Stockholm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, 
    there is another 'cargo manifest' available, which, according to the print-out 
    at the top of the pages, had already been sent at 18.38 hours on 27 September 
    1994, i.e. more than 30 minutes before the departure of ESTONIA, from Estline, 
    Tallinn to presumably Estline, Stockholm. In any event, on 29 November 1994 
    it was sent by N&T to Industrietechnik, which was the old firm of Börje Stenström, 
    where he worked until his retirement in April 1995, and from whom a member 
    of this 'Group of Experts' received it in March 1995. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the contents 
    appear to be identical on both 'cargo manifests' which were made up by the 
    same E. Kurvits, the handwriting at the end of page 4 is different. This 'cargo 
    manifest' is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.214.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.214.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently there 
    were doubts from the beginning as to whether the submitted 'cargo manifest' 
    actually reflects all the trucks/trailers having been on board and these doubts 
    have now been confirmed by the customs list hidden for so long, as explained 
    on the previous page. In fact, this list was sent already on 14 October 1994 
    by fax from the Finnish Embassy, Tallinn, to the head office of the criminal 
    police, Helsinki. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The combined weight 
    of all trucks/trailers was 970 ts according to the cargo manifest - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.211</a> - and the JAIC states the total truck/trailer-weight to have 
    been 1000 t, therefore it has to be assumed that the weight of the 40th truck 
    was 30 t.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the basis of 
    these weights a stowage plan has been made up always bearing in mind that 
    as much weight as possible had to be placed on the starboard side. The stowage 
    plan is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.215.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.215 </a>and reveals that it was impossible to place enough 
    weight on the starboard side<b> to create the alleged departure condition. 
    There must have been about 200 tons of weight more at the starboard side elsewhere 
    in the ferry. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is confirmed 
    by the calculations of Shipconsulting Oy, Turku - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.194.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.194</a> - according to which there must have been about 200 
    tons more weight at the starboard side. Such a weight distribution would have 
    created a 10° starboard list without the full port - and the empty starboard 
    heeling tanks, which allegedly reduced the list to 1° starboard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to survivors 
    trucks and trailers had been more or less equally distributed between the 
    port and the starboard sides of the car deck, thus, a wrong loading of the 
    car deck cannot have been the reason for the excess weight at the starboard 
    side. Consequently it has to be assumed that there has been water in tanks 
    and/or void spaces at the starboard side which was unpumpable. The reason 
    could be that these spaces were holed and thus connected to the outside and 
    therefore could not be pumped empty at all, e.g. the starboard heeling tank.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An indication for 
    such reason could be the image from the "Mudline video", shown below which 
    was made during the diving investigation between 1 and 4 December 1994 - See 
    Chapter 27. The image evidently shows a big hole in way of the starboard hull 
    -/bottom plating area probably in way of the bilge strake. The enhancement 
    of this part of the video tape by means of special equipment confirmed that 
    the plating was indeed holed. - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Those who know about 
    this issue remain silent and so does the JAIC although they had the right 
    and obligation to ask the relevant questions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible director 
    of the technical managers and part-owners N&T, Sten-Christer Forsberg, replied 
    when being interviewed by Erik Ridder-stolpe on 10.12.97 - Q: <i>"The vessel 
    was loaded totally wrong at Tallinn?" </i>A: <i>"The wrong loading is regrettable. 
    It would, however, have happened to any other crew!"</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that 
    the "wrong loading" could have occurred independently of what the crew did 
    or could have done, i.e. it has nothing to do with the loading of the car 
    deck but was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the crew, e.g. 
    the holed bottom plating. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3"><a name="2"></a>17.2<br>
    Testimonies concerning Cargo Lashings</font></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    evidence available in respect of the securing of trucks/trailers and other 
    vehicles is naturally controversial. While the crew members testified to having 
    secured all the trucks and trailers, though in different ways, this is confirmed 
    by only very few of the truck drivers/personal car drivers. The majority of 
    the drivers state that the trucks and trailers as well as the personal cars 
    remained unsecured. The truth is probably somewhere in between, i.e. probably 
    the trailers without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to 
    the deck with belts, some additional trucks having wedges in front of and 
    behind the wheels, and a certain number of trucks coming on board last as 
    well as all vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This with certainty 
    had also been the case with the truck and trailer of <b>Per-Arne Persson </b>according 
    to his statement from which the following is quoted:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Has made at 
      least 15 trips on "Estonia". The actual voyage was made with a Volvo truck 
      , type F12, reg. no. MOW 996, with trailer no. AN 069. Persson left his 
      truck with trailer on the car deck as per drawing below which is attached 
      to his statement.</i></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Accordingly 
      the vehicles were placed next to the forward port side of the centre casing 
      with the aft end of the trailers being only about 20 m away from the bow 
      ramp. Truck and trailer were loaded with plywood. The trucks were not secured 
      by any means, they were just standing there without any fastenings. Persson 
      did not note any other routine than on the previous voyages. As the vehicles 
      were again placed so close together that any securing was impossible, he 
      shouted to the crew: "You will never secure the trucks."«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The truck is entered 
    into the 'cargo manifest' under running no. 43773, the weight of truck, trailer 
    and plywood cargo was 55 ts, the distance to the bow ramp was only about 20 
    m and the truck was not secured because this was not possible due to the limited 
    space between the trucks. The complete statement with drawing is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.216.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In order to get 
    a better picture, the respective parts of the statements from crew members 
    and passengers having been on the car deck during and after the loading shall

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>- »I commenced 
      this additional training on the "Estonia" on 27.09.94 at 16.20 hours when 
      the loading of the trucks began. I myself was on the car deck until 18.45 
      hours. I remember that at that time all large trucks had already been taken 
      over and just the personal cars had to be loaded. The loading of those cars 
      was carried out by the 2nd mate. I can only recall his first name, Tormi, 
      his surname is unknown to me. As far as I know, he was in charge of the 
      loading. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As 
      to the question whether the vehicles loaded were secured to the vessel I 
      can reply: Each large truck was secured to the vessel. The personal cars, 
      in my opinion, were not secured, however wedges had been placed in front 
      of the wheels. I know nothing about a possible later securing. The question 
      whether I was on the car deck until the last truck had been loaded I am 
      unable to answer with certainty, because I left the deck some time before 
      the loading had been completed. <br>
      As to the question how and in what sequence the loading was carried out 
      I can reply: Loading in the port of Tallinn was performed via the bow ramp 
      by at first taking on board the heavy trucks, which were placed in the stern 
      part of the vessel and secured. Into the forepart of the vessel the smaller 
      trucks and personal cars were loaded. Into the middle part there were also 
      large and smaller trucks. <br>

    whilst Einar Kukk said, the personal cars had wedges in front of the wheels, 
    Valdur Matt stated, passenger cars were not secured by wedges. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the passengers 
    including truck drivers a total of 14 stated something about parking/securing 
    their trucks/cars on the car deck, of which 10 testified that their trucks/cars 
    were not secured and also that they had not seen any other secured or properly 
    secured trucks/trailers/cars and 3 did not know or were unsure. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The conclusion 
    of this 'Group of Experts' is that it has to be assumed that the trailers 
    without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to the deck by 
    belts, that some additional trucks had wedges in front of and behind the wheels, 
    and that a certain number of trucks, which had come on board last, and all 
    vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This refers also to the truck/trailer 
    of Per-Arne Persson, 24 m long, 55 ts. weight and only 20 m behind the bow 
    ramp, and to the heavy garbage containers stowed between the centre casing 
    and the bow ramp and in the aft part. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are rumours 
    that Estline had informed the freight forwarders around noon of 27 September 
    1994 that bad weather had to be expected and that the cargo in/on the trucks 
    had to be secured. It is, however, unknown whether any cargo in the trucks 
    was secured at all. In any event, when the last car had rolled on board the 
    car deck was practically full and the vessel reportedly had a 1° list to starboard.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This weighs 
    particularly heavy since as of noon the south-west storm warning was known 
    to those in command of ESTONIA, i.e. the storm would be hitting the ferry 
    from port, which would increase the already existing starboard heel further. 
    Under these circumstances it would have been not only a matter of good seamanship 
    but a question of ship safety to plan the loading of the car deck in such 
    a way that there was more weight at the port side to compensate for the heeling 
    moment to be expected due to the wind pressure on the port side. See the statement 
    of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    5.3.111.</a> <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This would 
    have been of particular importance because the heeling tanks could not be 
    used to adjust the heeling to be expected. The engineer on watch in the engine 
    control room before and at the time of the casualty - Margus Treu - has consequently 
    testified in his first statement on 29.09.94 at Turku, inter alia: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The port heeling 
      tank was full, but a starboard list of 1° remained. This was, in my opinion, 
      one of the causes of the casualty, because later when the vessel was heeling 
      to starboard there was no possibility to counteract.« </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to information 
    from Tallinn, about half an hour before the loading of the car deck was completed 
    two big trucks were escorted on board by military personnel whereby the whole 
    area around ESTONIA's berth was shut off by military forces. This was also 
    the reason why passenger Carl Övberg almost missed the ferry, because his 
    friend could not drive - as usual - to the terminal building to drop Carl 
    off in time. He just made it and as soon as he was on board the gangway was 
    pulled in - see the statement Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly the two 
    trucks were loaded with sensitive military equipment of unknown origin which 
    were sent by the Estonian Army directly to the Swedish military for on-transport 
    to another Western country. The transport was accompanied by militaries of 
    unknown nationality who were not identified as such on the passenger list 
    respectively who were probably not even entered on the passenger list. </font></p>

    wind speeds of up to 25 m/s corresponding to Bft. 9-10 and wave heights of 
    up to 5.5 m would be met in the open sea. This was about 3 hours before loading

    "safety inspector trainees" led by two Swedish Sjöfartsverket inspectors were 
    inspecting the ferry accompanied by chief officer Juhan Herma and chief engineer 
    Lembit Leiger (see Chapter 15). The inspection ended only about 11/2 hours 
    before departure and had created considerable problems for the chief officer 
    and the chief engineer who were of course aware of the very severe deficiencies 
    of bow ramp and visor. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the evidence available no particular precautions were taken by the deck crew 
    on the car deck. While the engine room crew got instructions from the chief 
    engineer to make seafast all moveable things in the engine room as bad weather 
    was to be expected. (Interview motorman Elmar Siegel - July 1996 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.192.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.192</a>). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    the forecasted wind speeds and wave heights would be no reason for concern 
    to those in command of a vessel like the ESTONIA, provided, that the vessel 
    was in a seaworthy condition and that her cargo was stowed and secured in 
    accordance with good seamanship. Both criteria, however, were not fulfilled 
    by ESTONIA. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">ESTONIA pulled 
    back from her berth on 27 September 1994 between 19.15 and 19.30 hours. <br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
    to the JAIC the vessel departed at 19.15 hours which is said to be a compromise 
    between the Swedish/Finnish and the Estonian Commis-sion members. While the 
    Estonians insisted on 19.00 hours at the beginning (because the departure 
    time has effect on the speed), the Swedes and the Finns referred to the statement 
    of Bengt Nilsson - see Enclosure 20.238 - who had testified as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The vessel 
      left the berth when they entered the restaurant, thus it must have been 
      19.30 hours or later, because the restaurant only opens at 19.30 hours.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andi Meister has 
    written in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i>, chapter 7, page 118, 
    that the time 19.15 hours for ESTONIA's departure could be found in the logbook 
    of the harbour master of Tallinn.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon departure 
    the vessel's trim was said to have been 0.5 m by stern and she had a list 
    of 1° to starboard, although the port heeling tank was full and the starboard 
    heeling tank was said to have been empty and in spite of the fact that gale 
    force winds had been forecasted from SW-ly direction, i.e. from port side, 
    thus increasing the starboard heel without any possibility to counteract. 
    When interviewed in 7/1996 motorman Elmar Siegel stated in this respect:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Q: <i>"Did "Estonia" 
    leave Tallinn with some list?" <br>
    </i>A: <i>"Yes, a list to starboard. Leiger (chief engineer) had phoned the 
    engine room and asked whether it was possible to correct it. It was a mistake 
    made during loading. The tank at the side, which would have to be filled to 
    correct the list, was already full and the tank at the other side was already 
    empty. Therefore we had no possibility to correct the list. It was 1°-2° and 
    due to the waves up to 3°-4°."<br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The full 
    wording of the interview is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.192.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.192. </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    crew member - car deck worker Valdur Matt - the bow ramp and visor were properly 
    closed and secured. He was probably the one who moved the turnable forward 
    parts of the bow-ramp rails into backward position and who secured both parts 
    by putting the pins into the respective holes before the bow ramp was lifted 
    up. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the passenger 
    Mikael Öun and others have stated that the visor was definitely closed or, 
    at least, looked closed from the open 8th deck when the ESTONIA pulled back 
    from her berth. Thereafter the passengers left the open deck because it was 
    windy and uncomfortable.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 17.00 
    hours on the same day the ferry SILJA FESTIVAL had been berthed opposite the 
    ESTONIA as pictured below. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the cafeteria 
    of SILJA FESTIVAL on the 4th deck a Finnish Doctor was having coffee with 
    his son and thereby observed the unberthing manoeuvre of the ESTONIA. Her 
    report - submitted to the Finnish part of JAIC on 10.01.95 and received by 
    this 'Group of Experts' only in December 1998 - reads as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On Tuesday, 
      27 September 1994, at 13.00 hours, I boarded the SILJA FESTIVAL in Helsinki 
      for a 24-hour cruise. I was accompanied by my son and we had a cabin together. 
      The ferry arrived at Tallinn at 17.00 hours the same day for a 4-hour stay. 
      Most of the passengers went ashore, but I stayed on board with my son and 
      we were walking around the vessel. At about 19.00 hours I was together with 
      my son in the cafeteria on the 4th deck having coffee. I saw through the 
      window that a vessel with the name ESTONIA was leaving the harbour at a 
      distance of about 20-25 m away from us. I knew the vessel from previous 
      times..... The weather was overcast and it was blowing moderately ....... 
      The day was just at dusk. I saw the vessel moving backwards from her berth 
      and saw that her bow visor was open. It seemed to me that it was not fully 
      open, but only half ....... I watched the ESTONIA for some minutes whereafter 
      her foreship disappeared from my view. I did not see whether the vessel's 
      so-called inner door was closed. While the vessel resumed her voyage I saw 
      that both stern ramps were closed. I followed ESTONIA's departing for about 
      5 minutes whereafter the vessel disappeared into the darkness.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
      mentioned to my son that the bow visor stood open and told him that for 
      the same reason a Belgian vessel had sunk some time ago. I was informed 
      by crew members of our vessel on the next morning at about 10.00 hours that 
      the ESTONIA had sunk.« <br>
      </font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete 
      statement is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/19.236.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg420.jpg" width="499" height="182"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above drawing 
    shows ESTONIA with half open visor. This means that the crew apparently at 
    first closed the visor while the vessel proceeded backwards from the berth 
    and, subsequently, when she had turned inside the breakwater opened it again 
    to a certain extent, possibly half, and passed the breakwater in that condition. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation 
    for this somewhat unusual behaviour was most probably the impossibility for 
    the crew to close the bow ramp completely, i.e. the ramp was closed by the 
    actuators to about 4-5 cm, whereafter normally the two ramp hooks would engage 
    the mating lugs at the upper part of the ramp and pull the ramp tight against 
    the rubber packings, whereafter the securing bolts would move one after the 
    other into mating pockets at the ramp; This was, however, no more possible 
    due to the severe twisting/misalignment of the ramp. This is subsequently 
    explained in detail in Subchapter 29.2, viz.: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) the port upper 
    pocket was intact and only slightly bent towards the centre-line of the ramp 
    with metal at both sides of the pocket slightly ripped which was probably 
    caused by the bending; the bolt was fully extended and about 100 mm below 
    the pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) the port lower 
    pocket was found to be intact with the bolt only partly extended and about 
    100 mm below the pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) The starboard 
    upper pocket was noted to be without cover plate which had been burnt off 
    by the crew in the morning of 27 September 1994 after arrival when it turned 
    out to be impossible to open the bolt; the bolt was fully extended; there 
    was apparently no misalignment between bolt and pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the starboard 
    lower pocket was crushed together to the effect that the bolt - noted to be 
    fully extended - could never have entered the pocket. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has 
    not been possible for the crew to secure the bow ramp at all by its four securing 
    bolts. The same refers to the port ramp hook which could not engage its mating 
    lug at the ramp, due to the misalignment of the port ramp side as it was demonstrated 
    already by the distance of ca. 100 mm between the mating pockets and bolts. 
    The obvious fact that the port ramp hook had never engaged its mating lug 
    is further confirmed by the intact hook and the intact, unbroken lug. Both 
    hook and lug are visible among other things on the diver video B40a. - See 
    also Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    ramp hook, however, is nowhere visible and the location where it should be, 
    is empty. It has thus to be assumed that also this hook had not engaged its 
    mating lug at the ramp, which means that the ramp had just been closed by 
    the actuators - as stated before - to an remaining opening of 4-5 cm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to several 
    mooring ropes and two wires found in way of the ramp and respective indications 
    on the ramp - see Chapter 29.2 - it has to be assumed that the crew tried 
    to close the ramp completely by means of mooring ropes and/or wires probably 
    pulled tight by means of the mooring winches on the forecastle deck. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg421.jpg" width="262" height="246"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently the 
    visor was closed and locked - see Subchapter 29.2 and Chapter 30 - while the 
    ferry proceeded already outside the breakwater towards the VTS between the 
    Island Nayssaar and the mainland on her last, fatal voyage in a condition 
    which shall again be summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged 
    and misaligned visor, which at sea quickly filled up with water to the outside 
    level, which was also insufficiently locked and secured, and the hinges of 
    which were considerably pre-damaged and weakened, in particular the starboard 
    hinge.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged 
    and misaligned bow ramp, which was not locked at all but most likely held 
    by one or more mooring rope(s)/wires, which was open to the water-filled visor, 
    with the port hinges being broken and the ramp detached from the vessel at 
    this side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The car deck loaded 
    with only partly or not all secured trucks/trailers and other vehicles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The port heeling 
    tank full while the starboard one was allegedly empty, a condition depriving 
    the vessel's command subsequently of being able to counteract when the vessel's 
    starboard heel increased due to the forecasted wind pressure on the port side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - One or more ballast 
    water tanks and/or void spaces being holed/leaking and consequently open to 
    sea. In short, the ferry ESTONIA was in many respects unseaworthy when she 
    departed from her home port for the last time as it is also demonstrated by 
    the images below.</font></p>

    explained below developed during the course of 27 September 1994:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The weather 
    conditions on the 27th September were dominated by a "strong and extensive 
    area of low pressure with several lows" which covered northern Scandinavia 
    and the Arctic Sea. See the weather chart for Europe in Enclosure 1 from 12.00 
    hours UTC on the 27th September. <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One 
    of these lows deepened on the 27th and moved rapidly east via southern Norway 
    and eastern Svealand towards southern Finland. The low remained relatively 
    strong and the centre was near Oslo on the 27th at 12.00 hours UTC with a 
    low pressure of 995 HPA, on the 28th at 00.00 hours UTC it was over the south-eastern 
    part of the Gulf of Bothnia with a low pressure of 980 HPA. On the evening 
    of the 27th a warm front connected to this low with occasional rain showers 
    passed quickly eastward over the northern Baltic. South and south-west of 
    this low pressure a wind change from SW to west occurred and the westerly 
    wind was very squally.«</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The SMHI has investigated 
    the weather conditions before, during and after the casualty on behalf of 
    JAIC. The results are summarised in a weather opinion with the title <i><b>"The

    these estimations by SMHI in the following comments on the route and the casualty. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having passed 
    the breakwater (see Chapter 19) ESTONIA proceeded between the mainland and 
    the Island Nayssaar and - after having passed the buoy off Suurupi Lighthouse 
    - altered course to 262° on the gyro-compass. This was confirmed by passenger 
    Anders Ericson, who had been on the bridge between 20.00 - 20.30 hours ET 
    - see his statement Enclosure 20.239 - and saw the course digitally shown 
    to be 262°, which is actually the true course to the waypoint on 59°20' N; 
    022°00' E. He also realised that the wind speed was then already 20 m/sec. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent 
    fact that ESTONIA had taken her normal route was further confirmed by the 
    observations of the meeting vessel AMBER. The M.V. AMBER is a Polish Ro-Ro 
    vessel, then on voyage from Gdynia to Helsinki when she met ESTONIA. The watch 
    officer of AMBER has only recently been traced and questioned. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    his testimony AMBER passed ESTONIA at 22.15/20 hours CET = 23.15/20 hours 
    Estonian time. ESTONIA was on a course of about 260/265°, at a position about 
    18 nm before the waypoint on 59°20'N; 022°00'E. She was running apparently 
    on full speed against heavy head seas which the watch mate on board of AMBER 
    described as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The ferry was 
      brightly illuminated and appeared to proceed against wind and sea at full 
      speed, which I could hardly believe. According to data from the ARPA her 
      speed was about 18-19 kn. She was pitching heavily and I saw how she was 
      taking a lot of water on the forecastle deck which smashed against the superstructure 
      and was thrown up to the bridge windows and spray was all over the vessel. 
      When her bow smashed into the waves I had the impression that she almost 
      stopped and subsequently built up speed again when the foreship rose. In 
      my opinion those in charge on the bridge of the ESTONIA must have been crazy, 
      absolutely incompetent and inexperienced. I had never seen anything like 
      this before.« <br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete 
      statement is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.237.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      20.237.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The evidence of 
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk, having been on the bridge until about 00.35 hours, 
    also confirms that ESTONIA at first proceeded to her normal waypoint. In summary 
    of the aforementioned it has to be concluded now that the ESTONIA took the 
    southerly route, i.e. her normal route, to the waypoint on 59°20'N, 022°00'E 
    and that she had apparently no problems until about 23.30 hours, when she 
    was last seen by the watch officer of AMBER. Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned 
    that in the files of the public </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    it has to be mentioned that in the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand 
    the copy of a navy chart was found which indicates that ESTONIA took a course 
    of about 270° true from the end of the Traffic-Separation-Scheme (TSS) between 
    the mainland and the Island Nayssaar straight up to Söderarm. This could have 
    been realistic since it was known from the beginning that she had to enter 
    the archipelago Söderarm because of the pilot examination of Captain Avo Piht. 
    Therefore it would actually not have been necessary first to go down to the 
    waypoint and then go up to the North again. On the other hand, it could also 
    be argued that sailing as long as possible in the shelter of the Estonian 
    North coast would be for the comfort of the passengers, although evidently 
    this was the last thing Arvo Andresson cared about. The navy chart is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.240. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the Finnish Navy, however, ESTONIA took with circa 90% probability a completely 
    different route. Allegedly after having crossed the TSS north of Nayssaar 
    she did follow the westbound lane along the Finnish coast, but subsequently 
    altered course to the south-west. In the opinion of this 'Group of Experts' 
    this is the less likely version because it is the longest distance and simply 
    impossible for ESTONIA to pass within the time available. The radar track 
    of this possible route of ESTONIA along the Finnish coast is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.241</a> together with the memo about the information received from the 
    head office of the Finnish Navy in December 1998. For more details see Subchapter 
    22.3.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the evidence 
    of the survivor Anders Ericson as well as that of the watch officer of AMBER 
    appears to be reliable and do confirm the normal route along the Estonian 
    North coast to the waypoint, it has to be concluded that this was the route 
    the ESTONIA took on her last voyage. </font></p>

    are shown. At 21.00 hours the watch on the bridge was taken over by 2nd officer 
    Peeter Kannussaar and 3rd officer Andres Tammes. Trainee officer Einar Kukk

    the waves. He compared it with a motorboat speeding over choppy waves. He 
    did not feel well and at about 23.30 hours ship's time he went to the aft 
    part of the 6th deck, there he found some shelter at starboard behind the

      <b>(3) </b>According to the JAIC, ESTONIA passed Osmussaar Lighthouse at 
      a distance of ca. 7.5 nm. The average speed was 20 kn between (2) and (3). 
      <br>
      <b>(4) </b>Further according to the JAIC the vessel passed the Apollo buoy 
      at about 22.55 hours, i.e. the distance of 16.5 nm between (3) and (4) was 
      covered in 55 minutes which corresponds to 18 kn. Note: Assuming that ESTONIA 
      passed the Tallinn breakwater already on full speed at 19.30 hours, which 
      the JAIC does but which is certainly too early, but anyway let's assume 
      it, she covered the 73 nm to the passing of AMBER in 3 hours 45 minutes, 
      which corresponds to an average speed of 19.5 kn. <br>
      <b>(5)</b> Further according to the JAIC the ESTONIA passed the Glotov buoy 
      at about 23.55 hours, i.e. from 23.15 hours. These are 40 minutes in which 
      she passed 10.8 nm, this corresponds to an average speed of 16.2 kn, a speed 
      reduction due to the increasing forward sea, in spite of all 4 main engines

      an affirmative reply. In any case, I have heard the order of the master

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In case the course 
    alteration to starboard of 25° had been carried out, the wind and sea then 
    should have come more from the port beam. Thus the speed should actually have 
    increased since the full engine output remained unchanged, however, since 
    the stabilisers had been activated after the waypoint, which reduced the speed 
    by ca. 1 kn, it has to be assumed that the speed increase was balanced by 
    the speed decrease and thus the speed over ground probably remained at about 
    15-16 kn, which is rather high under the circumstances prevailing.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    Einar Kukk, Silver Linde returned to the bridge at ca. 00.30 hours, while 
    actually he should have returned already at about 00.00 hours and started 
    his next round at 00.30 hours. According to the statements of Silver Linde, 
    available to this 'Group of Experts' (in total 8), he allegedly returned to 
    the bridge at about 00.00 hours and started his next (and last) round at 00.30 
    hours. Based on the apparent fact that Silver Linde has given more different 
    statements than anybody else, this 'Group of Experts' is inclined to believe 
    that Einar Kukk, who was new on board and not a crew member, is much less 
    influenced by the surrounding circumstances than Silver Linde was and still 
    is. In case Silver Linde should have returned to the bridge only at about 
    00.30 hours he must have left for his next round shortly afterwards and went 
    again down to the car deck. Since it could not have been the water on the 
    car deck which kept him down there, because this was noted already before 
    22.00 hours when the starboard stern ramp was slightly opened - See Subchapter 
    29.7 - while he had taken over the watch only at 22.00 hours. It has rather 
    to be assumed that the crew activities on the car deck, to hold the visor 
    and the bow ramp, were the reason for his delay.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    ESTONIA continued with unchanged full output to force her way against the 
    still increasing seas while most of her passengers had already gone to bed, 
    be it that they were seasick or that they were just tired of always having 
    to hold on to something due to the hard movements of the ferry. Only very 
    few could sleep, most were lying awake listening to the noises created by 
    the vessel when slamming into the waves and feeling the vibrations caused 
    by the 4 main engines running on full power.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As already 
    outlined in the previous chapter, quite a number of passengers were most irritated 
    by the way the vessel was powering against the waves and many truck drivers 
    were thinking of their trucks down on the car deck, especially those knowing 
    that their trucks were not secured. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular 
    the passengers in the cabins on 1st-deck, i.e. the deck below the car deck, 
    were alerted from the beginning because they were not only below the car deck, 
    but also below the waterline and not far away from the bow area with the partly 
    loose visor moving up and down within the play created by the indented stempost, 
    the missing rubber packings and the worn out lugs of the locking devices.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this respect 
    reference is made to the statement of Mikael Öun - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.225.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These banging noises - in 
    all probability created by the visor moving within the available play - had 
    already been heard by many passengers on previous voyages, among those was 
    passenger Ivan Petrov who had stayed in cabin 1064 on 22.09.94 and reference 
    is made in this respect to Subchapter 12.4.5 - Other Observations.<br>
    The ESTONIA continued all the time on full power against the increasing seas 
    until at about 00.50 hours - after it had been noted or reported that something 
    was wrong with visor and/or bow ramp - the speed was reduced to probably 6 
    kn until at 01.02 hours the vessel heeled wide to starboard and turned to 
    port. At this moment the farthest point to the West must have been reached, 
    because shortly afterwards at approximately 01.10/12 hours, the main engines 
    stopped and the vessel drifted East or NE and lost the visor about 30 minutes 
    later. It has thus to be assumed that the farthest point to the West has been 
    about 0.5 nm to the West of the alleged visor position, where ESTONIA must 
    have been at about 00.50 hours.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> After ca. 00.50 hours ESTONIA was first turned to starboard and 
    subsequently to port and was presumably kept on SW course against wind and 
    sea for some time until the sharp port turn commenced, which explains the 
    more southerly Mayday position. The distance from the 23.15 hours-position 
    to the ca. 01.00 hours-position is 30.0 nm which the vessel passed in 1 hour 
    45 min., of which the last ca. 10 minutes were on reduced speed. This corresponds 
    to an average speed of ca. 17 kn. <br>
    As the time of the casualty sequence-of-events commenced at about 00.30 hours 
    and ended at about 01.50 hours with the sinking of the ESTONIA the many statements

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Officially 
    137 persons have survived the catastrophe, some are crew members, two are 
    advisors and the others are passengers. Most of them have testified to the 
    police in Finland, Sweden and/or Estonia, some three or more times. Only a 
    few crew members have been questioned directly by the JAIC.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They 
    are:</font></p>

        Andres Vihmar (only by Bengt Schager).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has also 
    interviewed only very few of the passengers or advisers directly, e.g. Pierre 
    Thiger has been interrogated by Olof Forsberg and the statement is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.1.248.1.</a> The Finnish Commission member Tuomo Karppinen has spoken by 
    telephone to the truck driver Eckard Klug and to the advisors Paula Liikamaa 
    and Peter Järvinen. The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.1.248.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andi Meister's book<i> 
    "The Unfinished Logbook"</i> and also the interview which Jutta Rabe held 
    with him and subsequently with Bengt Schager, the psychological expert to 
    the Swedish part of JAIC, reveal however that the Estonian Commission members 
    as well as the Estonian security police and other government bodies have frequently 
    spoken to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. 
    It is unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings 
    are not available. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    Kari Lethola, chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, the following survivors 
    have not been interrogated at all:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Igor Gricius 
        from Dobele/Latvia,<br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Gull-Britt 
        Payr from Stockholm, <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arturas 
        Tamasauskas from Paneveöys/Lithuania.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the latter 
    it is only known that he was the driver of the Lithuanian van, No. CVK 445. 
    He refused to testify at all and left the hospital without permission. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Of the other 133 
    survivors, however, at least one statement of each is available to this 'Group 
    of Experts'; in total there are 243! Contact was made with some of the key 
    witnesses and additional information was obtained and/or relevant information 
    was confirmed. These interviews - in addition to the statements taken by the 
    police - are also available on video cassettes. The interviews were either 
    carried out by a member of this 'Group of Experts', by the Finnish lawyer 
    Henrik Gahmberg or by the Estonian journalist Juri Liim in close co-operation 
    or in the presence of a member of this 'Group of Experts'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The relevant parts 
    of some of the statements and all of the interviews have been translated into 
    English and are attached as enclosures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All the available 
    statements and interviews have been analysed, but only those statements of 
    crew members made on the day of their rescue, or shortly thereafter, were 
    considered to be reliable and thus possibly not influenced by the ESCO/Estline/N&T 
    representatives and/or other interested parties. Similar weight was put on 
    statements and interviews where members of this 'Group of Experts' were present 
    and could talk to the survivor directly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Several drawings 
    are attached which indicate the layout of the crew and passenger cabins on 
    all decks, the car deck with centre casing and lift arrange-ments, the 1st 
    deck with passenger accommodation and engine control room (ECR), further the 
    0-deck with sauna/swimming pool/conference compartments and the sewage treatment 
    area with the vacuum system directly next respectively aft of it and, further 
    aft, the location of the heeling tanks and the stabiliser pockets directly 
    aft of the heeling tanks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of the 
    analyses of all the available statements and interviews with regard to the 
    time up to and including the casualty sequence of-events are outlined in the 
    following Subchapters 21.2 - 21.9.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other relevant observations 
    made by survivors during and after the sinking, while waiting to be rescued 
    and subsequently after their rescue, is explained in Subchapter 21.8 - Other 
    Observations.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At about 23.00 
    hours a large wave hit the vessel's port bow.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The master came 
    to the bridge again about 30 minutes later and asked the 3rd officer whether 
    all 4 engines were running, which was confirmed. The master then ordered that 
    the stabilisers were to be activated <b>after the next course change </b>and 
    left the bridge approximately 15 minutes before, i.e. at about 00.05/00.10 
    hours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The wind was coming 
    from SW and veering West, whilst the waves came more from southerly directions. 
    The sea was quite heavy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He was apparently 
    still on the bridge<b> when the vessel changed course around 00.25-00.30 hours, 
    although he never said so,</b> but he stated that the 2nd officer told him 
    that the vessel would make about 1 knot less speed after the stabilisers had 
    been activated. The speed was then about 14.5-15.0 knots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At about 00.30 
    hours Silver Linde returned to the bridge and Einar Kukk left for his cabin;

    21.2.1.252</a> - he said that Linde left the bridge at this time for a new 
    round.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He went to his 
    cabin, cleared up some matters and then went to Pub Admiral, where also Karaoke 
    was being performed (5th deck, starboard side, aft). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There he saw Silver 
    Linde in the door at about 00.40 hours. Kukk left after some minutes and went 
    to his cabin. There he arrived at ca. 00.50 hours, went to bed, but could 
    not sleep.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>After 5-10 
    minutes</b> he heard <b>a very strange noise which was very unusual </b>(and 
    alarming) to him, it could have been an impact or strong vibration and the 
    vessel behaved very strangely; he got up and dressed; <b>while he was putting 
    on his shoes the vessel rocked and heeled abruptly to starboard</b>, he cannot 
    say how much, but it was very far. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He rushed up to 
    the 7th deck and<b> met boatswain Vello Ruben in the central stairway,</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    means that the boatswain had been somewhere further down when the heel occurred 
    - most probably on the car deck - because his cabin was on deck 7. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when he was between 
    6th/7th deck he noted a shock/vibration inside the vessel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>He and the 
    boatswain helped each other out of the door on to the open deck 7; </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the list was then 
    about 45° and the engines had definitely stopped;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - on deck 7 he met 
    Ivan Ziljajev, a crew member with a walkie-talkie, and <b>further forward 
    in a liferaft, Silver Linde; </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when the list was 
    90°, he looked at his watch: it was 01.30 hours and he slid into the water,

  The Distress Communication</b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ESTONIA was equipped, 
    in compliance with the old system, with a radio-telegraphy station and a radio-telephone 
    system. The radio installation and the competence of those serving it satisfied 
    the SOLAS Requirements. In addition, there were some 30-35 portable VHF maritime 
    radio-telephones (walkie-talkies) available to particular crew members which 
    were not indicated in the vessel's radio licence. These VHF-sets could also 
    communicate on channel 16. It is obvious that the transmission power of such 
    VHF-sets is much less than the power of the permanent VHF-installations on 
    the bridge with antennas on top of the mast. As parts of the 'Mayday' transmissions 
    were received very weakly and partly interrupted, it has to be assumed that 
    the mates used their walkie-talkies. Also the many disturbances on channel 
    16 during this time might have played a role.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It cannot, therefore, 
    be excluded that those on the bridge had already tried to get out a 'Mayday 
    message' much earlier. The anonymous information from an A.B. sailor of a 
    large Swedish ferry in the vicinity of the casualty, who called during the 
    "Efterlys"*) TV program in summer 1996 might be a confirmation for this assumption.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> -------------------<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="1">*) "Efterlys" 
    is a Swedish TV program comparable to the German program "Akten-zeichen XY 
    ungelöst" which presents unsolved criminal cases to the public.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The sailor reported 
    that they had heard a very weak 'Mayday' from the ESTONIA already about 30 
    minutes before the 'Mayday' at 01.22 hours which finally triggered off the 
    rescue operation. They had not reacted because it had been very weak and was 
    not repeated, at least they did not hear anything more and other ferries were 
    much closer. When it subsequently turned out that ESTONIA was really in trouble, 
    he and the mate decided to remain silent about the first weak 'Mayday'. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore the 
    first official 'Mayday' was recorded by the Marine Rescue Coordinating Centre 
    (MRCC) Turku, also very weak and very strange, at</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>01.21.55</b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Mayday, 
    Mayday Estonia, please." </i></font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This in itself already 
    implies the urgent request to (finally) being heard, under-stood and helped. 
    Also on the bridge of the Swedish ferry SILJA SYMPHONY this 'Mayday' was heard 
    and the watch A.B. sailor Jan Öhrn started the tape recorder, thus the subsequent 
    distress communication is fully recorded and the respective transcript, already 
    translated into English, is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.1.365.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    22.1.365. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The actual 
    distress traffic under participation of the ESTONIA was very short, only 8 
    minutes, and according to the recordings of MRCC Turku reads as follows:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The statement 
        of Andres Tammes was wrong in some respects, viz. (a) at 01.24 hours the 
        list was at least 50°-60° and therefore they had a blackout of most consumers, 
        because after the auxiliaries shut off at a list of 40°-45° the emergency 
        generator only supplies power to a restricted number of consumers to which 
        the GPS Navigator should have belonged (was installed subsequently and 
        is thus unknown to the yard);</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) even if the 
        GPS Navigator had not been connected to the emergency generator's power 
        supply, it still would have shown the last position for the following 
        15 minutes. Consequently, Andres Tammes cannot have been right in explaining 
        his inability to provide the position with 'blackout'. Rather, it has 
        to be assumed that he was unable to look at the GPS Navigator from the 
        position inside the bridge where he was desperately holding fast to something 
        at the high port side, probably near the aft door. In this connection 
        it has to be borne in mind that - straight after the end of the distress 
        communication at 01.25 hrs. Tammes and Ainsalu left the bridge through 
        the port aft door (statement Henrik Sillaste), and - at 01.25 hrs.</font></p>

    1st officer Teijo Karl Peter Seppelin</b> on watch. In his statement, taken 
    by the Finnish part of the JAIC he reported the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»It was Wednesday, 
      i.e. the 28th, and the time was about 01.20 when I heard the Mayday on Channel 
      16. The call was weak and I could not make out the name of the broadcasting 
      vessel. In this instance the radio traffic did not come through as normal, 
      crystal clear. I immediately responded: "Who called and transmitted a Mayday"? 
      After this I got in contact with the ESTONIA. The conversa-tion was initially 
      in English and then the guy on the ESTONIA asked if I spoke Finnish. I answered 
      in the affirmative and after that we continued in Finnish. ESTONIA reported 
      a bad 20°-30° list and asked for help. These details have been recorded 
      in the SILJA EUROPA's radio log and in the ship's log. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      Mayday was received but after that the guy on the ESTONIA was unable to 
      give his position. I got the information that they had a complete black 
      out on the ESTONIA. I called ESTONIA again and managed to reach them. This 
      time the ESTONIA gave me their position which was 59° 22' N and 21° 48' 
      E. The SILJA EUROPA's position at that stage was 59° 32' N and 21° 28' E. 
      After this I called the Master to the bridge and myself started navigating 
      towards the area indicated by the ESTONIA. Simultaneously I started up more 
      engines in order to have full speed.«</font></i></p>

    and he reports in his statement, which is only available in Swedish, as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The wind was 
      quite strong and blowing from WSW with 16-17 m/sec. The sea was rough and 
      spray was over the whole vessel. Our speed was about 11-13 kn. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
      I took over the watch at 22.00 hours I saw the ESTONIA at port side about 
      30° forward of abeam. I saw SILJA EUROPA further ahead of us at starboard 
      side. ESTONIA was proceeding faster than we were, I saw once by the vector 
      that their speed was 14.3 kn which is the highest speed I would have dared 
      during this night. I estimate that the average speed on ESTONIA was 14 kn. 
      Her course at 22.00 hours was almost West and she was holding herself quite 
      well at our side. We steered a little more to the West to have the wind 
      from right ahead, which was westerly. <br>
      I saw ESTONIA all the time on the radar. I had a vector every 15 minutes. 
      <br>
      At 01.30 hours the master, Captain Thörnroos phoned the bridge and asked 
      how the weather was. I replied something like the vessel's pitching and 
      at the same time I heard on Channel 16 that ESTONIA said one time 'Mayday'. 
      I think that the following words were "blackout" and "heavy listing". I 
      asked the master to come up and that's what he did. I replied immediately 
      to ESTONIA but they did not answer. Also after the master had come up to 
      the bridge I continu-ously tried to get contact but ESTONIA did not answer. 
      Simul-taneously with my attempts to establish contact with ESTONIA I took 
      her radar position ..... .<br>
      As soon as the master was on the bridge we altered course towards ESTONIA. 
      The distance was ca. 9 nm when he called 'Mayday'. We could even see ESTONIA 
      visually. Earlier many times I had looked at her through binoculars and 
      knew her silhouette quite well.<br>
      After we had heard the 'Mayday' call we saw the lights of ESTONIA. While 
      I was taking care of the navigation, the master was trying to get in contact 
      with Helsinki Radio, first over VHF and then on MF 2182 kHz, both of which 
      failed. He finally managed to get in contact with the shore by mobile phone.«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based

    duty at MRCC Turku, Ilkka Jouko Kalevi Kärppälä, and at the Coast Guard station 
    Nagu/Pärnäs, Rauli Tapio Winberg, must be wrong. Reportedly it had been admitted 
    in the media that the Mayday calls were recorded automatically, but that actually 
    nobody had been on watch at these stations and that this is the explanation 
    why nobody reacted at the beginning (see also the following Subchapter 22.3

    silence of the Finnish MRCCs, but what about Sweden and Estonia?<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the following 
    two questions are difficult to answer. It shall, nevertheless, be attempted:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Why was the 
      Mayday transmitted so late?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) Why did SILJA 
      EUROPA and MARIELLA insist on establishing ESTONIA's position, although 
      they knew exactly that the vessel between them and somewhat more to the 
      South was ESTONIA? (These 3 ferries had been arriving at and sailing from 
      Stockholm together since February 1993). This refers in particular to MARIELLA 
      because those on the bridge saw ESTONIA continuously since being overtaken 
      by her off Hangö an the watch officers established her position immediately 
      after they heard the 'Mayday'.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to 1.) :</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the investigation 
    results of this 'Group of Experts' question one might be explained as follows:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has been 
    mentioned already at the beginning of this subchapter that the transmissions 
    had been very weak for two reasons, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the mates most 
      probably had used their 'walkie-talkies', and <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Channel 
      16 was considerably disturbed. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore it cannot 
    be excluded and has to be assumed that a 'Mayday' had been called earlier 
    already. This is confirmed, on one hand, by the anonymous telephone report 
    of a watch A.B. on a ferry in the vicinity and, secondly, by the circumstances 
    on board which had mandatorily required the 'Mayday' at the very latest after 
    the big heel at 01.02 hours. The indication of Silver Linde in his statement 
    no. 3 on 17.10.94 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.2.255.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.2.255</a>), that he was sent down from the bridge to inform them about 
    the alarm to the Information desk minutes before the big heel, could confirm 
    this as could the statement of Henrik Sillaste<b> that the lifeboat lashings 
    had been released in advance.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Furthermore, those 
    on the bridge of ESTONIA had been aware of the following problems: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The starboard 
      stabiliser which did not move out and a respective alarm had appeared at 
      about 00.30 hours, which activated Margus Treu and was - according to the 
      book of Andi Meister - the real reason to call down Henrik Sillaste, and 
      subsequently Kadak and Sillaste tried to get the stabiliser fin out, probably 
      by beating with a sledge hammer while Treu returned to the ECR. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Margus Treu 
      reported to the bridge that <i>"the bow ramp had been struck and became 
      broke"</i> (that is what Treu told Kadak), most probably after he had seen 
      it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) Silver Linde 
      reported to the bridge that <i>"there is a lot of water on the car deck, 
      we have to leave the vessel"</i> (overheard by Ervin Roden).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed 
    with certainty that the watch officer, 2nd officer Peeter Kannussaar, immediately 
    informed the master and chief officer, who certainly came to the bridge probably 
    together with the chief engineer within 2 or 3 minutes maximum. As a next 
    step, the speed was reduced to probably 6 kn (Margus Treu) and the course 
    was slowly changed to starboard with the aim of taking the pressure off the 
    visor and wind and sea on the stern at slow speed and then to send crew members 
    down to the car deck to close the partly open bow ramp. It has to be assumed 
    further that 4th officer Kikas was steering manually during this manoeuvre. 
    When the wind and sea came almost abeam from starboard the vessel began to 
    roll more and more, less to port / wider to starboard and those on the bridge 
    realised that there was the risk of capsizing to starboard and decided to 
    turn back to port. This was apparently done too fast in the attempt to stop 
    the dangerous rolls and the ferry swung rapidly to port and made a wide heel 
    to starboard - reportedly 45°-50° - and came back to almost upright condition. 
    The very abrupt and rapid heel caused numerous people to be catapulted out 
    of their bunks, to be thrown against walls, roulette tables and other heavy 
    objects to be torn loose and smashed against the wall and the like. Therefore 
    it has to be assumed that at the highest point of the superstructure - the 
    bridge - also some or all of those on duty there lost their hold and were 
    catapulted the very long distance across the breadth of the bridge into the 
    starboard wing (where indeed one body was found by the divers). It is not 
    unrealistic to assume that it took them - at least - several minutes to recover, 
    if at all, and then to realise the situation. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has further 
    to be assumed that 2nd officer (B) Kannussaar, whose watch was over at 01.00 
    hours, was sent down to the car deck, probably together with the nautical 
    adviser Juri Aavik, the chief engineer Lembit Leiger, the boatswain Vello 
    Ruben and some A.B.s, among them Aulis Lee and Aarne Koppel. They were working 
    on the car deck when the two severe impacts occurred around 01.00 hours, shortly 
    afterwards followed by the big starboard heel at 01.02 hours, the vessel righted 
    almost up, but the heel increased again and those on the car deck realised 
    that they had no chance to hold the visor and to close the bow ramp and tried 
    to get up to the bridge, respectively to deck 7. Silver Linde, Aarne Koppel 
    and Aulis Lee made it, they were already on deck 7 opening liferafts when 
    crew members from the cabins on deck 7 came out (the purser Andres Vihmar 
    for example). The passenger Per-Erik Ehrnsten, coming from his cabin on deck 
    6, i.e. only one deck below and located near the forward central stairway, 
    even saw Silver Linde and two other crew members walking in the inner alleyway 
    from the aft crew accommodation forward towards the centre stairway only minutes 
    after the big heel. Aulis Lee even managed to get back to his cabin on the 
    starboard side of deck 4, to pick-up his wife Aina and both got back to deck 
    7 in time and survived. Simultaneously those on the bridge obviously considered 
    their options whilst the situation was deteriorating by the minute, the vessel 
    being now on a south-easterly heading with the deep starboard side exposed 
    to the wind and waves, the main engines shut off, but when the vessel stabilised 
    for some time at a heel of 40°-50° this might have raised hopes for a while 
    that the vessel might stay afloat until the arrival of assistance from shore. 
    This might have caused them to delay the urgently required transmission of 
    'Mayday' and alarm for the passengers even further. When finally at about 
    01.21/01.22 hours the heeling started again to increase 2nd officer Ainsalu 
    desperately called<i> "Mayday, Estonia, please"</i>, etc.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this does 
    not explain why Ainsalu and subsequently also Tammes did not use the bridge 
    installed VHF or even the MF installation being much stronger, which would 
    have connected them with the outside world immediately.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently 
    there must have been circumstances on the bridge which prevented them from 
    using the installations. One reason could be the authority of ESTONIA's master, 
    Arvo Andresson, who never permitted the mates on duty to take any action on 
    their own. Therefore also during this night the mates on the bridge presumably 
    did not dare to undertake on their own such a drastic step as advising the 
    outside world by transmitting a 'Mayday' that the pride of their nation, the 
    ESTONIA, was in serious trouble. Unthinkable according to the philosophy of 
    Arvo Andresson and his superiors ashore, and this could be a reason why the 
    'Mayday' was transmitted so late, i.e. in a situation when main engines and 
    auxiliaries had already shut off automatically and the vessel was heeling 
    at 45°-50° since 01.22 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand, it also cannot be excluded that the mates transmitted a 'Mayday' much 
    earlier, i.e. before 01.00 hours already, but by means of the "walkie-talkies" 
    and at a time when transmissions over Channel 16 were severely affected by 
    heavy disturbances.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As, however, 
    no one from the bridge has survived and the evidence of watch A.B. Silver 
    Linde in respect of his observations on the bridge around 01.00 hours have 
    proven to be wrong, because he never was on the bridge after 00.30 hours, 
    and furthermore the four bodies found on the bridge by the divers were not 
    examined - at least not officially - it will probably never become known what 
    happened on the bridge after 00.30 hours, unless the unmanipulated videos 
    are released and/or new diving investigations are carried out.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Within less than 
    1 minute Thörnroos appeared barefoot on the bridge. In the meantime Eklund 
    had twice tried to get in contact with ESTONIA.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The name of the own 
    vessel always has to be mentioned after the name of the vessel being called.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">But there came 
    no answer. Not before 1 minute and 5 seconds later when a sound, as from a 
    whistle, was heard which most probably was a disturbance caused by somebody 
    activating the transmitter on channel 16 without using it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a further 15 
    seconds the desperate voice from ESTONIA came again: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Europa - Estonia 
      - Silja Europa - Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now chief officer 
    Teijo Seppelin from SILJA EUROPA replied directly in English, which is the 
    normal radio communication language in international waters:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this 
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Ainsalu called again 
    as if he had not heard SILJA EUROPA: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Silja Europa.« 
      </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin replied 
    again:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this 
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He got no reply, 
    21 seconds elapsed before Ainsalu came back:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, 
      Viking - Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now Ainsalu suddenly 
    called both SILJA EUROPA and the undefined Viking apparently not knowing which 
    Viking vessel was the nearest. The master of MARIELLA had meanwhile arrived 
    on the bridge and tried to get in contact with ESTONIA himself:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Estonia, Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Immediately thereafter 
    came Ainsalu:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Mayday, Mayday.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two minutes and 
    9 seconds had by now elapsed since the first Mayday. Teijo Seppelin on SILJA 
    EUROPA apparently had difficulties accepting that one of the large Baltic 
    ferries was calling Mayday. He asked again and not fully in line with the 
    international rules for distress traffic by VHF:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia - 
      Silja Europa - asking you - eh. Are calling you Mayday? Estonia, what's 
      going on? Can you reply?« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A correct reply should 
    have been an immediate acknowledgement of the Mayday call and a question for 
    the position. Now a new and somewhat more energetic voice came from the ESTONIA, 
    the 3rd officer Andres Tammes who continued in English:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»This is Estonia.«<br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Then 
      he changed into Finnish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Who is there? 
      Silja Europa, Estonia.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied 
      in English.<br>
      <i> »Yes, Estonia. This is Silja Europa.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, who according 
    to his professional qualifications spoke English, continued in Finnish and 
    now obviously tried to calm down the emotions somewhat by being polite:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Good morning. 
      Do you speak Finnish?«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes,«</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied<br>
      <i>»I speak Finnish.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The further communication 
    between Tammes and Seppelin continued in Finnish. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Yes, we have 
      a problem here now,« <br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">said 
      Tammes<br>
      <i>»a bad list to the right side. I believe that it is 20°, 30°. Could you 
      come to our assistance and also ask Viking Line to come to our assistance?«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied: 
      <br>
      <i>»Yes, Viking Line is behind us and they surely got the information. Can 
      you give your position?«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes: <br>
      <i>»...(unclear)...we have blackout, we cannot get it now. I cannot say 
      it.« </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin:<br>
      <i>»Okay, understood, we'll take measures.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This was a confusing 
    question from Seppelin and one of the most peculiar ones of the whole rescue 
    operation. These large vessels proceeded on almost the same course every night. 
    SILJA and VIKING departed from Helsinki together at 18.00 hours, while ESTONIA 
    left Tallinn one hour later. All three vessels headed for Sandhamn, where 
    they normally arrived more or less at the same time. Only in strong southerly 
    and south-westerly winds would all three use the northern entrance to Stockholm 
    - Söderarm. They knew exactly where the other vessels were and one look at 
    the radar screen would have told Seppelin where MARIELLA and ESTONIA were. 
    This question to ESTONIA, however, also indicates that he knew where MARIELLA 
    was. Consequently, he should also have been aware that the radar echo on port 
    side aft of abeam was ESTONIA. However, instead of turning SILJA EUROPA soonest 
    towards the already sinking ESTONIA a long discussion via VHF channel 16 commenced 
    about ESTONIA's position. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes 
    from ESTONIA told Teijo Seppelin that they had a 'blackout' which normally 
    means that the power supply has totally failed and thus they were unable to 
    state their position. Both GPS Satellite Navigators installed on the bridge 
    - a "Shipmate" in the control panel and a "Magnavox" in the chartroom - were 
    connected to the emergency generator as well as to the emergency batteries 
    according to the Estonian members of the JAIC. Both GPS Navigators were automatically 
    switched off when the auxiliaries stopped and switched on again after the 
    start of the emergency generator. In order to overlap this break a battery 
    installed in the GPS Navigator supplies power in the meantime and the set 
    remains connected to the chain and shows the position continuously; consequently 
    the position remains on the display, at least of the "Shipmate" GPS. Therefore, 
    this could not have been the reason for Tammes's problem in stating their 
    position. The reason was most probably his difficulties to hold to something 
    at his position in the bridge, most likely at the aft door at port side, because 
    at 01.35 hours when the VHF-communication between Tammes and Seppelin commenced 
    ESTONIA must have heeled ca. 50°-60°, which was quickly increasing, and not 
    20°-30° as stated by Tammes. It was most probably impossible for Tammes from 
    his position to have a look at the "Shipmate" GPS installed in the front console. 
    It took some time for chief mate Juhan Herma to get to the Shipmate from where 
    he had been before inside the bridge and shout the position to Tammes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now the master of 
    MARIELLA came in:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, 
      Mariella.«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes, Mariella, 
      Europa here - Mariella on 16.« </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos asked:<br>
      <i>»Yes, listen, is their position clear to you? Is it they who are on our 
      port side?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> More peculiar questions, 
    this time from Captain Thörnroos of MARIELLA. The 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund, 
    who had been on the bridge all the time, was able to inform his master directly 
    which echo on the radar screen belonged to ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»There is Estonia!« 
      </i><br>
      said Eklund and pointed to the lights on the horizon.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his statement 
    to the Finnish criminal police Captain Thörnroos subsequently also testified 
    that he <i>»saw the lights of Estonia without the help of binoculars.</i>« 
    Eklund had seen ESTONIA overtaking MARIELLA outside Hangö and had followed 
    the radar track ever since. Thus, there could be not doubt which echo was 
    ESTONIA and consequently what her position was.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied 
      to Thörnroos:<br>
      <i>»No, I didn't get any position from them, but they must be here in the 
      neighbourhood, they have 20°-30° starboard list and blackout.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied.<br>
      <i>»I think that they are here at our port side approximately 45°.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now more than 4 
    minutes had passed since the 1st Mayday of ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin said,<br>
      <i>»Okay, yes, I am just waking up the skipper.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time 
    MARIELLA altered course towards ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Suddenly Andres Tammes 
    came back, now clearly with desperation in his voice: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Are you coming 
      to assistance?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously the Estonians 
    had now given up all hope, because the list must then have been some 70°, 
    only 2 minutes later the bridge was under water.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin asked:<br>
      <i>»Yes, can you see us?« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, however, 
    in his desperate situation, having to face the loss of his life within the 
    next minutes, apparently did not understand this as he replied:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, I can 
      hear you.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As ESTONIA had been 
    on a south-easterly heading for some time already her deep starboard side 
    was exposed to the wind and sea; SILJA EUROPA was at port side aft of abeam 
    whilst MARIELLA was at port side about abeam, thus both vessels could most 
    likely be seen by those on the bridge of ESTONIA. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin then said: 
      <br>
      <i>»Okay, we will start to determine your position here now. Just a moment.« 
      </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After Thörnroos had 
    tried in vain to get in contact with Helsinki Radio via VHF or on 2182 kHz, 
    SILJA EUROPA asked:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, have 
      you any visual contact at all with Estonia ?«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »No.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied 
    (which was wrong, because at that time the emergency illumination of ESTONIA 
    was still on.) Since he had seen the lights of ESTONIA clearly on the horizon 
    during the last minutes, this reply is not understandable. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos said 
      later: <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»This 
      was wrong and I shall, of course, be criticised for that.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin then 
      came back to Thörnroos, expressing himself rather softly by saying:<br>
      <i>»We must start and try to find her somewhere, it is a bit difficult to 
      say as they didn't give any position.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> But now, after all 
    hope for ESTONIA had apparently been given up, the chief mate of ESTONIA managed 
    to lower himself down to the front console where the Shipmate was installed 
    and read their position; his voice has been identified on the tape of the 
    distress communication shouting the position to Andres Tammes, who repeated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»59°22' (W), 
      21°40' (E)«.</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is unknown whether 
    this was really the correct Mayday position, because on the bridge of MARIELLA 
    the 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund noted the position having been 59°22' N, 21°39' 
    E, about 0.5 nm more to the West. Receipt of the position was confirmed by 
    SILJA EUROPA and then ESTONIA came back for the last time at 01.29.55 hours 
    - 7 minutes and 15 seconds after the first Mayday call and 5 minutes before 
    the battery-powered clock on the starboard side of the bridge stopped :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Really bad, 
      it looks really bad here now.« </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes said 
      and Seppelin replied:<br>
      <i>»Yes, it looks really bad«</i>, in a sort of routine way always repeating 
      what the other vessel said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»We are on our 
      way and it is 21.40.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes came back 
    once more at 01.30.06 hours, apparently in Estonian with a phrase which according 
    to the master of MARE BALTICUM, Erik Moik, meant:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»How far away 
      are you?«</i>, which would certainly make sense. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 
    that time the ferry must have been more or less on the side. According to 
    Henrik Sillaste - who was then already in the liferaft together with Silver 
    Linde and others - that was approximately the situation when Andres Tammes 
    and Tormi Ainsalu left the bridge through the port door and climbed down to 
    the 7th deck where they helped with the opening of liferafts and pushing them 
    into the water. Whereas the body of Andres Tammes was subsequently found, 
    Tormi Ainsalu is missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The behaviour of 
    those on the bridges of SILJA EUROPA and MARIELLA can simply be explained 
    by their reluctance to accept whatever the Estonians did or did not do. When 
    the first rather weak and hesitantly spoken Mayday was heard already at about 
    00.45 hours, the first thought of the officers on the bridges of the MARIELLA, 
    SILJA SYMPHONY and SILJA EUROPA was probably something to the effect of "Oh 
    no, not ESTONIA again, don't they even know what Mayday means?" and, indeed, 
    the first message was not repeated. When the 2nd officer Ainsalu called 'Mayday' 
    again rather weakly and hesitantly and even added "please" at 01.22 hours 
    the reaction on the bridges of the Finnish and Swedish ferries was not much 
    different (in the meantime the officers on SILJA EUROPA had changed watch 
    at 01.00 hours). They simply could not believe that the situation on the ESTONIA 
    was so bad as to justify a Mayday call, an impression which at the beginning 
    may even have been underlined by Andres Tammes's statement: <i>»We have a 
    bad list ..... I believe that it is 20°, 30°.... we have blackout.« </i>Only 
    later, when his voice had become really desperate and the lights of ESTONIA 
    had disappeared, did they realise that the situation was indeed very serious 
    and then they reacted appropriately.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A similar way 
    of thinking may probably have influenced the speed at which the rescue operation 
    was set into motion by those responsible, as will be explained in Chapter 
    22.3. </font></p>

    from the ESTONIA drifted southeast to south-southeast according to the Annexes 
    6/4 and 6/5 of Supplement No. 402 of the Final Report of the JAIC and stranded

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 29 and 30 September 
    1994 in total 433 immersion suits, 289 lifevests and 8 containers full of 
    lifevests were found along the coast of the Island of Hiumaa. All but one 
    of the 10 lifeboats of the ESTONIA got away from the vessel. Life-boat no. 
    2, i.e. the first one on port side, was still attached to its davits during 
    the ROV and diving investigations. Eight of the remaining 9 lifeboats were 
    found drifting upside down or water filled and they stranded subsequently 
    either on the Estonian mainland beaches or on the Island Hiumaa (Dagö). Lifeboat 
    no. 1 - a motor launch specifically equipped for emergency actions, e.g. man 
    overboard manoeuvres and thus called on board the "MOB rescue boat" - was 
    found near Hangö according to the JAIC report page 130, subchapter 8.10. Upon 
    request for details about the position and condition of the boat the National 
    Bureau of Investigation - Criminal Technological Laboratory - advised however 
    that life-boat No. 1 had actually been picked up on 29 September 1994 at 14.30 
    hours by the M.V. "HYLJE" (F.B.N. vessel) in position 59°16'40"N; 22°52'12''E 
    and subsequently brought to Hangö - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/23.1.391.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    23.1.391.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This position 
    is only 8.5 nm to the south-east of the wreck position and not very likely 
    because the lifeboat had to break loose from its davits before the vessel 
    had settled down on her starboard side at the sea bottom as it otherwise would 
    have been burried in the sea bottom below the vessel. This means that the 
    lifeboat had to break loose from the davits and start drifting on 28.09.94 
    at about 02.00 hours. At 14.30 hours on 29.09.94 when it was allegedly found, 
    it had been drifting for 36.5 hours already but covered a distance of 8.5 
    nm only.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand according to Supplement 402 to the JAIC Report Annexes 5/5 and 6/4 the 
    lifeboats had drifted already 27.68 nm to the south-east within the first 
    24 hours, while the total distance to the Island Hiumaa (Dagö) is only 33 
    nm. Therefore the alleged as-found position for lifeboat No. 1 is unrealistic. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Lifeboat No. 
    9 - the last one on the starboard side - was found on the Estonian coast. 
    When it was inspected a camera with two films, belonging to the Swedish press 
    photographer Håkan Isefjord, was found jammed inside the boat. Håkan Isefjord 
    was a passenger but did not survive. The finding of the camera with the two 
    films was reported only days later to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from 
    where the information was passed immediately to the criminal police in Stockholm 
    - See Enclosure 21.1.392. Instructions on how to treat the films were passed 
    to Tallinn and the then acting prosecutor Birgitta Cronier ordered camera 
    and films to be brought to Stockholm soonest. When the objects arrived in 
    Stockholm, however, there were said to be no films. All this is revealed from 
    the files of the finally acting prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The search 
    for the wreck and the visor of the ESTONIA was organised and performed by 
    the Finnish Board of Navigation (F.B.N.), the Finnish Navy and the Finnish 
    Coast Guard in close co-operation with the Accident Investigation Board, the 
    Finnish part of the JAIC. The survey vessels SUUNTA and EVA-200 (Estonian) 
    as well as the oil-pollution fighting vessel HALLI and the Coast Guard vessel 
    TURSAS were employed for various operations. In addition, an unknown Finnish 
    reconnaissance vessel and three Swedish mine hunters were engaged during the 
    time between locating the wreck (and the visor) on 30.09.94 and the official 
    locating of the visor on 18.10.94.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">What 
    actually happened during this time lies in darkness and can only be assumed 
    to some extent from the facsimile messages sent by Kari Lethola, head of the 
    Finnish part of the JAIC (PCIMA), to Olof Forsberg, head of the Swedish part 
    of the JAIC. These faxes were found in the archives of the Swedish Commission 
    (SHK), but it has to be excluded that the sequence is complete. Also some 
    of the publications in "Svenska Dagbladet" (SvD) and "Dagens Nyheter" (DN) 
    in those days throw light on the probable occurrences.</font></p>

      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two 
      ROVs were successful on Sunday in video filming the "Estonia". The commission 
      has issued strict orders to the oil-pollution fighting vessel "Halli", which 
      carried out the operation, not to talk about or show the films made so far.<br>
      Apparently it becomes more and more certain that the visor in front of the 
      bow ramp to the car deck has been the cause for the casualty. Dr. Jouko 
      Nuorteva, who analysed the sonar pictures taken after "Estonia" had been 
      located, could give them a new interpretation on Sunday.<br>
      According to Nuorteva is the vessel lying on an easterly heading and in 
      the course direction as it had been assumed in the beginning. <b>Adjacent 
      to the bow there is a big object which was either torn off or is hanging 
      from the hull. According to Nuorteva the object could be the damaged visor 
      or part of it. </b>The video pictures should explain if the visor had indeed 
      such a big damage. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Detailed

      The investigators do have access now to many hours of video tapes as well 
      as to numerous still pictures both in black and white and in colour. "The 
      pictures are of high quality, so much we can say", said Kari Lethola. "At 
      first the pictures shall be analysed by the commission and then we shall 
      decide what can be published", said Lethola.«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>It 
    has been confirmed by the man in charge of the interpretation / evaluation 
    work that there was<b> a big object adjacent to the hull which could be the

    not was clearly answered by the ROV investigations of the bow area on 02.10 
    and 09.10.94, however, no clear answers were given to the public and the respective

    states that the search for the visor continued, although it had been known 
    to the JAIC already since 02.10.94 that the visor was lying next to the bow 
    of the wreck. This is even indicated on the drawing being part of the fax 
    where a smaller separate object can be noted to the starboard side of the 
    bow. Moreover, the area indicated on the same drawing as having been searched 
    - 2 nm to the east of the wreck, 1 nm to the west of the wreck and 1 nm to 
    the south, i.e. a rectangular 3 nm x 1 nm - includes the position where the 
    visor was allegedly found on 18.10.94, i.e. in position 59°22,97'N; 21°39,33'E 
    according to the Finnish Navy and in position 59°23'N, 21°39,2'E according 
    to the Swedish Navy - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.398.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.398</a> - Letter Försvarsmakten (Defence Forces) to SHK dated 09.12.94. 
    It is difficult to believe that such a big steel mass as the visor should 
    have been overlooked or should not have been indicated on the sonar. The remark 
    at the end of the fax that<i> "the Norwegian SCS is still active and receives 
    free marketing by the press"</i> suggests that the Norwegians had offered 
    some services which had been rejected by the JAIC and that the operation was 
    performed by Finnish vessels apparently without the expected success. Therefore 
    Lethola was now asking Sweden to send vessels to help search for <i>"what 
    we were looking for"</i>. It is difficult to believe that this relates to 
    the visor which by then must have already been found since some days. The 
    Norwegian involvement needs to be investigated.</font></p>

    hunting expert already by Friday, 14.10.94, although the search for the visor 
    was scheduled to commence only on Monday, 17.10.94. This could lead to the 
    assumption that Swedish mines were somehow involved, i.e. since the ESTONIA 
    and her visor were resting more or less directly on the line Utö-Ristna it 
    might be that there was a Swedish mine field in that area.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No more facsimile 
    messages are available and on 18.10.94 the visor was finally also officially 
    found, however, in position<b> 59°23,0'N; 21°39,2'E,</b> which is 0.85 nm 
    in direction 272° from the actual wreck position - see also <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.398.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.398</a> - but 1.7 nm in direction 238° from the wreck position stated to 
    be the original location position - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.407.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.407</a> - which is<b> 59°23,9'N; 21°42,1'E.</b> The actual wreck position 
    59°22,9'N; 21°41,0'E, which has been verified by tug "OTTO WULF 4" on 30.06.95, 
    is 2112 m distant in direction 211° from the Finnish "original location position". 
    Since a wreck from the ESTONIA dimensions cannot move for 2100 m over the 
    sea bottom the original location position has been wrong from the beginning, 
    which is confirmed by Kari Lethola's first fax - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.393.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.393</a> - where he stated the original position to be 59°23'N; 21°42'E 
    which is almost correct except that the latitude should be 21°41'. In any 
    event, on 02.10.94 and 09.10.94 they did carry out very detailed ROV investigations 
    of the wreck and probably also of the visor then lying with great probability 
    below the bulbous bow.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It therefore has 
    to be assumed that the Finns deliberately moved the wreck position 1.7 nm 
    to the NNE. This wrong position was maintained during October and November 
    and was even taken over by Sjöfartsverket in the specification drawn up by 
    this administration for tendering the diving investigation of the wreck, which 
    was sent to 11 different companies, where the following positions are stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> bow : 59°23,91'N;

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Smit/Rockwater were 
    awarded the contract to examine the wreck and the surrounding sea bottom. 
    Even when their diving support vessel "SEMI I" and the survey vessel "SIRA 
    SUPPORTER" with Johan Fransson and experts from Sjöfartsverket, Tuomo Karppinen 
    and others from Finland, Börje Stenström from the JAIC and Arne Valgma from 
    the E.N.M.B. together with an unknown number of criminal and other policemen 
    were approach-ing the area allegedly the Smit/Rockwater people did not get 
    a corrected position and consequently sent the ROVs down at the wrong position. 
    This is - at least - what is reported and the actual wreck position was subsequently 
    found by the SIRA SUPPORTER by means of the ORE sidescan sonar tow fish. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason 
    why all this was necessary is unknown to this 'Group of Experts', but it has 
    to be assumed that the apologetic letter that Kari Lethola wrote to the Traffic 
    Ministry on 11.01.95, wherein he explains that he had possibly exceeded his 
    authority when "isolating the wreck", has to be understood in this connection. 
    The letter with office translation is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.408.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.408.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be assumed that the Swedes and Finns had found the visor next to the bow 
    of the wreck, possibly the bulbous bow even resting on the visor, already 
    on the 01. or 02.10.94, but decided to keep this secret as well as the actual 
    position of the wreck and to continue the search for the visor. The Estonians 
    were sent to search to the East (where the visor definitely never was) while 
    the Finns with the help of Swedish mine hunting experts and vessels clarified 
    something around the wreck which apparently had to do with Swedish mines. 
    On 18.10.94 the visor was "officially" located and sometime later the "mines" 
    operation was completed, whereafter <b>the recovery of the visor at a position 
    about 2100 m SSW off the alleged wreck position was carried out from 12th 
    to 19th November 1994.</b> The visor was picked-up and lifted to the surface 
    by the Finnish multi-purpose ice breaker NORDICA assisted by the Swedish mine 
    hunter FURUSUND. According to the entries into the logbook of the NORDICA 
    - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.408.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.408.1</a> - the visor was picked-up in position 59°23' N; 21°39,4' E. This 
    was ca. 1400 m West of the wreck position. </font></p>

    sent down to the wreck on 02.10.94 and produced remarkably sharp pictures, 
    which showed, among other things, that the visor was missing and that its 
    hinges and locking devices were broken. Apparently two ROVs were used which 
    were given the names <i>"Jutta"</i> and <i>"Siimo"</i> and which produced 
    an unknown number of video films of which three films are available. These 
    are:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Copies of these three 
    videos were handed over to this 'Group of Experts' in March 1995 by the Finnish 
    part of the JAIC as "raw material". This turned out to be untrue, because 
    relevant parts, e.g. showing the starboard hull and unknown objects on the 
    bottom of the sea, had been cut out. Therefore a professional examination 
    of the video films by experts has been conducted and revealed that the films 
    have been cut frequently, mostly up to 3 minutes, sometimes up to 17 minutes. 
    The cuts deleted footage taken when the ROVs were inspecting parts of the 
    wreck and also debris on the sea bottom. Consequently it has to be assumed 
    that the most interesting parts permitting conclusions have been cut out of 
    the "raw" material. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> It 
      is doubtful whether Börje Stenström was the only JAIC representative on 
      board as it would be against the general attitude of the Finns demonstrated 
      before and after the diving investigation, namely to be represented by their 
      own people whenever relevant parts of the investigation were carried out. 
      Since the diving investigation of the wreck was the most relevant part of 
      the investigation so far, it has to be assumed that Finland was represented 
      by Tuomo Karppinen, as testified by Arne Valgma who attended on board.<br>
      This assumption is shared by the then chairman of the JAIC, Andi Meister, 
      in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i>, where he states that the Estonian 
      participant Arne Valgma shared his monitor cabin with Tuomo Karppinen from 
      the Finnish part of JAIC. According to Andi Meister this was subsequently 
      denied by the Finns who - for understandable reasons - did not want to take 
      over part of the responsibility for the occurrences on board of the diving 
      platform SEMI 1 such as the wilful manipulation and deletion of essential 
      evidence in which Mr. Karppinen most likely participated.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The main purpose 
    of the diving operation, which was paid by the Swedish Government, was to 
    establish:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Could the 
      ESTONIA be lifted up as a whole? <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) How many 
      bodies could be recovered without lifting the vessel, and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) would 
      it be possible to cover the ESTONIA with stones/concrete?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The results are 
    outlined in two official reports available to the public, viz. </font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the 
    divers had to inspect and record on video tapes the foreship area as well 
    as the navigation bridge on behalf of the JAIC and according to the instructions 
    of Börje Stenström and/or Tuomo Karppinen. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the Rockwater Report to Sjöfartsverket the underwater work was documented 
    on 19 video tapes which were handed over to Sjöfartsverket/Swedish criminal 
    police before they left the diving platform by helicopter. Allegedly Rockwater 
    kept only those videos on which the safety of the divers was documented, in 
    case health problems should appear, which was not the case. Those videos allegedly 
    were destroyed one week after the last diver entered the bell.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a subsequent 
    meeting in Helsinki on 02.10.96 between the JAIC and the Rockwater representatives 
    Ray Honour, managing director / Dave Cawson, project manager / Terry Jost, 
    diver (one of the two divers having examined the bridge) the following was 
    established: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Whatever the 
      divers did was documented in detail by Rockwater in three different logbooks. 
      It is possible to check each individual episode by comparing the entries 
      in the logbooks with the video logs respectively with the videos themselves. 
      It can be excluded that sequences have been removed from the videos. On 
      some tapes date and times are recorded, on others not because the input 
      had to be made in the operation room which was not done with all tapes. 
      The conditions were very difficult, the visibility was poor, each movement 
      caused a cloud of settled-down sediments.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The diving operation 
    was performed by four teams of three divers who worked around the clock from 
    two diving bells hanging next to the wreck. The first diver of the team remained 
    in the bell, the other two proceeded to the designated area where one did 
    the work according to instructions from the supervisor in the operation room 
    while the other secured him by checking his umbilical, etc. The divers worked 
    in diving suits with helmets, which were connected by the said umbilical containing 
    all the necessary supply and communication lines to the diving bell respectively 
    to the diving platform. On top of the helmets one searchlight and one, probably 
    two, video cameras were mounted. The diver received his instructions through 
    two earphones - one in each ear - and spoke into one microphone. On the video 
    tapes available to the public only the voice of the supervisor into one of 
    the earphones and the voice of the diver are audible. Only on some occasions 
    does it become evident that the diver gets additional respectively other instructions 
    when he reacts differently or replies differently, this being particularly 
    obvious when he quickly turns his head away from areas which the public should 
    not see as will be explained on the following pages. It is common practice 
    - according to the diving expert Brian Braidwood - that divers carry two different 
    earphones during an operation like the one under consider-ation here.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to being 100% 
    supplied and disposed off via the umbilical these divers do not create air 
    bubbles in the water. <br>

    were produced in the PAL format by the cameras on the helmets of the divers.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also these films 
    were handed over to the video experts of Disengage/UK for analysis and evaluation 
    - see Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of the 
    results was that - except videos 11 and 18 - all other video films - although 
    made in the PAL format - had been copied by a PAL/SECAM machine without a 
    converter in between. This results in poor copies, which are much too light 
    and unclear - a fact which makes a proper evaluation of the video material 
    very difficult, sometimes impossible. In addition, relevant parts had been 
    cut out of these videos as will also be demonstrated in Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These videos 
    were and still are being copied in Sweden by a private company called "FORSVARSMEDIA" 
    which is said to work exclusively for the Ministry of Defence, and as such 
    has security clearance. Reportedly Börje Stenström had decided before any 
    copying was done which parts should be hidden from the public and cut out. 
    These concern footage showing the hull above the starboard mudline including 
    the starboard stabiliser and certain areas of the foreship and the bodies 
    inside the wreck and on the bridge. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">While the video 
    sequences showing undesired parts of the wreck were deleted - which fact has 
    led to the discrepancies in the timing as shown by Disengage (see Subchapter 
    34.6) - the bodies have been made invisible by light spots, also the three 
    "official" bodies on the bridge. Even though it is stated in the Rockwater 
    Report, among other things: »The bodies on the bridge showed signs of decomposition, 
    but were also undamaged.«, and the Sjöfartsverket Report added: »On the bridge, 
    where many windows were missing, one body had been attacked by fish.«, the 
    bodies on the bridge were allegedly not identified by their uniforms. This 
    was explained by Börje Stenström, as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The divers 
      did not know any of the victims personally. So, how could they identify 
      them?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By 
    the stripes on their uniforms, as it had initially been assumed that all victims 
    were officers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is most annoying, 
    because the question who was on the bridge during the final minutes is of 
    importance, in particular, whether the master was there.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the distress 
    communication it is known that the watch officer - 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu 
    - the 3rd mate Andres Tammes and most probably also chief officer Juhan Herma 
    - had been on the bridge until 01.30 hours - the end of the 'Mayday' communication 
    - see Subchapter 22.1 - when the vessel was practically on the side. Of these 
    three Ainsalu and Tammes were seen by Sillaste to leave the bridge, while 
    Herma apparently remained inside. According to 3rd engineer Margus Treu, he 
    was asked by 4th mate Kaimar Kikas at a rather late stage after the diesel 
    generators had already shut down, whether he could pump freshwater overboard 
    from the starboard tanks. Thus it could be assumed that the 4th mate also 
    stayed in the bridge. The third body should be the master according to the 
    "evidence" of watch A.B. Silver Linde, which in all probability is wrong because 
    he had not been back to the bridge before, at or after 01.00 hours - see Subchapter 
    21.2.2. Nevertheless, the crew survivors were very certain from the beginning 
    that Captain Andresson had died on the bridge, which is not surprising because 
    it has to be assumed with certainty that at least one of the surviving officers/engineers 
    had been on the bridge after the big heel and seen what had happened.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary this 
    would explain the three bodies as found by the divers, viz. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1) close to the 
      door leading out to the aft on port side, across the door leading to the 
      inside stairway.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2) inside 
      the chart room without further details.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3) in the 
      starboard wing below the broken loose flagbox.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above is revealed 
    from the voice communication between two divers and the supervisors on board 
    the SEMI 1 according to video tapes B40c and B40d which are available and 
    from the Finnish report of the JAIC, page 131. In addition, more information 
    about the bodies became publicly known partly through the Andi Meister book 
    "The Unfinished Logbook" and partly through the Estonian media. These are:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the body at 
      the aft port door was wearing a brown or red/brown suit.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the body 
      underneath the flagbox in the starboard bridge wing had a tattoo on his 
      right hand.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly neither 
    Captain Andresson nor Juhan Herma nor Kaimar Kikas had a tattoo on their right 
    hand and certainly none of them was wearing a brown or red/brown suit. So, 
    who are the three bodies on the bridge and where does this information come 
    from? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, 
    the detailed knowledge of the Estonians about the condition of the bodies 
    inside the bridge indicates that they had been there with own divers. Furthermore, 
    neither the descriptions above nor the few words of the divers audible on 
    the videos indicate that any of these bodies was badly decomposed and/or had 
    been attacked by fish.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The explanation 
    for this discrepancy was discovered by Disengage when analysing the available 
    footage frame by frame. They found out that the first diver inspecting the 
    bridge - Dave Mawston - before entering the port bridge wing through the lower 
    aft window, which was already broken, cleared away the glass remains and mashwire 
    and then pulled out a body by the hair to the outside where he let it go. 
    This body was only approximately half a body because the lower half was missing, 
    possibly due to having been attacked by fish or by being badly decomposed? 
    Whatever the cause for this terrible injury might have been, this body was 
    neither found near the port aft door nor in the chartroom nor in the starboard 
    wing below a flagbox; it was removed from the bridge before the first diver 
    entered the bridge and before the aforementioned three bodies were found. 
    Consequently there had been a fourth body on the bridge, the existence of 
    which is not mentioned by the Swedish participants. The evaluation of the 
    so-called "Mudline video", showing the starboard hull - and bottom area in 
    way of the mudline, revealed the existence of a fifth body just outside the 
    starboard bridge wing which is also nowhere mentioned. - See Subchapter 34.6. 
    Apparently the Swedes in the JAIC were also hiding these bodies from the only 
    Estonian participant of the diving investigation, Arne Valgma, who was said 
    to have been sleeping during the first inspection of the bridge, because he 
    had been told that nothing special would happen during the hours ahead. He 
    was interviewed on the subject by Spiegel TV, but the interview is not available. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The question remains: 
    Why didn't the Swedes onboard the SEMI 1 arrange for proper identification 
    of the bodies on the bridge and why do they keep secret the fourth and the 
    fifth body?<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were 
    several other incidents respectively observations during the diving survey 
    to which attention has to be drawn, viz.: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The torn and

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> No. 2 - was made 
      on 02.10.94 and shows the aft part of the port bridge wing looking from 
      aft. The vertical stanchion, initially located vertically in line with the 
      aft plating of the wing, is visibly bent forward (arrow 1) together with 
      adjacent plating - arrow 2. The paint at the (port) outside of the stanchion 
      is completely scored off.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> No. 3 - made on 
      02.10.94 and shows the same area from below with the stanchion and plating 
      pushed forward and a pulled down square looking like an access hatch which, 
      however, had not been there on delivery of the ship according to the drawings. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No. 4 - made during 
      the diving investigation on 03.12.94 and shows the plating of the underside 
      of the port bridge wing now completely torn off. The arrow points to the

      the initial underside plating which is now missing.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    that part of the damage did exist already on 02.10.94, i.e. 4 days after the 
    casualty when the first (official) ROV went down and that the damage was enlarged 
    during the time until the diving investigation of 01.-04.12.94. The damage 
    is not mentioned in either the Smit-Tak/Rockwater Reports nor in the Sjöfartsverket 
    or JAIC Reports and has also not been discussed by the media.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This damage 
    cannot be attributed to the casualty and also does not look as having been 
    caused by fire or explosion. It is however obvious that there is heavy impact 
    damage at the aft lower part of the bulkhead which together with the vertical 
    stanchion supporting the wing was pushed forward. It therefore has to be assumed 
    that this was caused by interested parties searching for something particular 
    hidden inside the void space between the bridge floor and wing underside, 
    prior to and again after 02.10.94.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>as to (2): The 
    inspection of particular cabins on deck 6.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to video 
    B40a and the video tape log page - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411</a> - the diver entered the forward part of deck 6 and tried to enter 
    cabin 6132, which had been occupied by a member of the Stockholm Police ST-Section, 
    but failed, then tried the next cabin 6135 but failed again and then 6134 
    also without success. The diver returned to the outside for tools and moved 
    in again, broke open cabin 6132 - found a suitcase without name tag and left 
    it behind. He then worked his way to cabin 6230 which was the 2nd cabin from 
    port side of the four luxury cabins in the fore part of deck 6 overlooking 
    the foreship. According to the statement of purser Andres Vihmar of 15.05.96 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.195</a> - this cabin had been assigned to the master of the second crew, 
    Captain Avo Piht. In the alleyway in front of this cabin the diver found a 
    body. The diver, obviously receiving instructions through his second earphone 
    not audible on the available video, broke up the door and headed straight 
    for a suitcase, which was open but - according to the diver - apparently nothing 
    was missing (how could he know?) and the suitcase had a label with the name 
    Alexander Vorodin. The diver carried the suitcase out of the accommodation 
    and it was apparently hoisted up to the diving platform. The diver subsequently 
    broke open or tried to break open the cabins in the vicinity of cabin 6230, 
    all of which had been occupied by members of the ST-Section of the Stockholm 
    Police. The owner of the suitcase, Alexander Vorodin, had been on board together 
    with his uncle and nephew, and all three survived. According to the first 
    and only statement of Alexander Vorodin and to the 2nd statement of his uncle, 
    Vasili Krjutjkov, they had been in cabin 6320. In his 1st statement Vasili 
    Krjutjkov testified, however, that they had been in cabin 6230 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.196</a> - which was indirectly confirmed by his young nephew Vassili Vorodin 
    - see his statement <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.341.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.4.341</a> - who testified that he had been thrown out of his bed to the 
    floor by the big heel and thereafter they had looked out of the window and 
    seen the vessel heeling heavily to starboard. As can be seen from the drawing 
    below showing the forepart of deck 6 - cabin 6320 is an inner cabin without 
    windows and with only 2 beds (1 upper/1 lower) which are arranged athwartships, 
    thus no one would be thrown out these beds if the vessel suddenly heeled to 
    starboard. Cabin 6230, however, has 2 upper and 2 lower beds which are arranged 
    in longitudinal direction, i.e. if the vessel suddenly heeled to starboard 
    somebody in the port side beds could be thrown to the floor as it happened 
    to Vassili Vorodin. Furthermore this cabin has two windows overlooking the 
    foreship.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently the 
    Vorodins had been in cabin 6230 which is also confirmed by the presence of 
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin in this cabin. The question is why did Andres 
    Vihmar testify to the police that it was the cabin of Captain Avo Piht where 
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin was found, who had the reputation of being 
    a weapons smuggler, and was therefore so interesting to the criminal police 
    of Stockholm. A transcript with the voice communication during the above explained 
    examinations is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.412.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (3): The 
    inspection of the forward part of the 1st deck and the 0-deck.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to video 
    tape log RW/SEMiI/EST/D/011 page 1 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411.1</a> - the diver S. Jessop entered the forward part of the 1st deck 
    through an opening cut by the divers into the shell plating. He examined the 
    port side cabins, established that the only accessible watertight door was 
    closed (all doors close from port to starboard, thus it has to be assumed 
    that the door had closed by gravity due to the starboard list after the hydraulic 
    pressure had slackened sometime after the sinking) and then - according to 
    the video log proceeded at 14.54 hours <b>towards the spiral stairway</b>, 
    which<b> only leads to the sauna and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck</b>, 
    where damage to the starboard shell plating is assumed. Without any notation 
    in between the log continues after 1 hour and 6 minutes without any explanation 
    as to what the diver did during this time. Thereafter the diver left the wreck 
    through the outside opening. The lower part of the video log page No. 1 - 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411.1</a> - shows the respective entries. Apparently the times 14.54 and 
    16.00 have been manipula- ted and the page was cut between these figures, 
    something which had been written in between has been taken out and both parts 
    of the page copied together. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The part taken 
    away concerns the activity of the diver between 14.54 and 16.00 in the area 
    at the end of the spiral stairway which is the 0-deck with sauna- and swimming-pool 
    compartments. It is obvious that the JAIC did not desire that the inspection 
    results were made public. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (4): The 
    ROV has not been inside the car deck and the consequences.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In spite of five 
    attempts and although the supervisor says so, the ROV cannot have entered 
    the car deck through the bow ramp opening, because</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the video 
      sequences do not confirm this, and <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the video 
      depth shown on the ROV display - 81 m - is too deep for the car deck. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless the 
    ROV moves between pallets with cement bags and other objects looking like 
    cargo apparently lying on the sea bottom. As it is highly unlikely that this 
    intact looking cargo originates from other vessels, it must have come from 
    ESTONIA even though the bow ramp and both stern ramps are closed or almost 
    closed. Although the starboard stern ramp was certainly more open at some 
    stage when the vessel was still afloat and severely heeled, it is very difficult 
    to assume that cement bags on pallets should have fallen off some truck or 
    trailer and then out through the open ramp and exactly next to the position 
    where the vessel finally settled down. The respective video is B40b from 03.12.1994. 
    Another open question which demands clarification. See also Subchapter 34.6.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (5): Divers 
    with other equipment were active inside the car deck.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On video B40c the 
    "official" diver was working on top of the bow ramp looking into the car deck 
    when suddenly a frogman type diver appeared in the beam of his searchlight 
    who rapidly tried to get away by swimming backwards, however, was picked-up 
    by the camera. <br>
    On another occasion air bubbles are coming up from the car deck, although 
    the "official" divers do not produce air bubbles and allegedly were not working 
    inside the car deck at all. On a further occasion lights can be seen inside 
    the car deck, although the "official" divers have not been there.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On another 
    occasion the supervisor said: <i>"They are getting their diver(s) back." </i>or 
    <i>"We have to wait until they get their divers back." </i>On another occasion 
    the supervisor said to the diver:<i> "We have to stay on the outside, the 
    inside is no good for us" </i>obviously meaning the car deck. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates 
    that another diving operation by other divers went on simultaneously, longer 
    or shorter, than the official one and it is indeed the question what these 
    divers were doing inside the car deck and why their activity was and still 
    is kept secret?</font></p>

    Further analysis of this footage revealed that this was an angle iron (arrow

    this steel piece had been placed there deliberately by the crew to prevent 
    the actuator fastening from hooking at the edge of the front bulkhead because 
    the ramp had been considerably hanging down with its port side due to the 
    broken port hinges which had destroyed the initial alignment of the actuator 
    fastenings in the vessel and at the ramp.</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>CHAPTER 28</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE ROV INSPECTIONS IN 1996</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In preparation 
    of the covering of the wreck as decided by the Swedish Government already 
    in 1995 the Finnish Environment Protection Organisation and the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation began with preparations in spring 1996 to pump out the heavy 
    fuel from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA as soon as the weather situation 
    permitted. For this purpose reportedly two sophisticated ROVs were leased 
    from Norwegian off-shore operators, which could also perform underwater flame-cutting. 
    Furthermore, the oil-pollution fighting vessel HALLI was equipped with an 
    installation able to warm up the asphalt-like heavy fuel and then pump up 
    the liquid part, a rather time consuming matter. This installation proved 
    to be very sensitive and thus work could only be performed up to wind force 
    Bft. 4, whereafter the installation had to be pulled up. In order to make 
    use of the sophisticated ROVs Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka from the Finnish 
    part of the JAIC then frequently took the chance to make further ROV surveys 
    of the wreck. A request by a member of this 'Group of Experts' for permission 
    to attend one of these ROV surveys of the wreck was categorically denied by 
    the Finns. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently a copy 
    of a video allegedly made on 19.06.96 was received which shows images of good 
    quality (PAL format and copied to PAL) of the foreship area only, although 
    the complete vessel had been resurveyed and more videos had been made which, 
    however, were not made available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation of 
    the video tape revealed that the area around the port outer ramp hinge was 
    now quite well visible without the mattresses, blankets and whatever else 
    the crew had squeezed into the gap created by the partly open bow ramp. A 
    damage hole in the port lower front bulkhead can be seen which will be explained 
    in Subchapter 29.2.Also a strong lug welded to the front bulkhead is visible 
    which was fitted by the yard for the wire controlling the bow ramp ropes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The video further 
    produced very clear images of both the port and the starboard visor hinge 
    bolts, both front bulkheads and parts of the bow ramp which improved the evidence 
    available already and which is further discussed in Subchapter 29.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon respective 
    questioning, Karppinen and Rahka advised that there were no holes in the hull 
    and that otherwise no changes to the wreck had been observed. Only later did 
    it become public that during these ROV surveys it was discovered that steel 
    plates, which the divers had previously fitted and welded over the holes cut 
    by them into the shell plating forward and aft in way of deck 1, had been 
    removed from their openings in the meantime. (Theses plates reportedly weighed 
    500 kg.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed 
    that those who removed the heavy steel covers from the openings are probably 
    identical with those who broke off the steel sheeting underneath the port 
    bridge wing - see Chapter 27. Needless to say that these facts are not mentioned 
    in the Report of the JAIC. </font></p>

      there is little to no heel. Both rudders are clear and do have an angle 
      of 35 degrees to starboard. Both propellers and propeller shafts are clear. 
      Starboard bilge is clear from the seabed and the deck side is partly buried 
      in the mud. Liferafts have not been noticed in the racks and since none

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 and 2 - show 
      the visor ashore at Hangö in the position as it had been attached to the 
      ship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 3 - shows the 
      large indentation at starboard side of which the larger, lower part was 
      probably caused by contact with the bulbous bow. This larger indentation 
      extends down to the gap at the stempost. There was already a rather deep 
      vertical indentation from a previous occurrence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 - shows the upper 
      part of the large indentation which looks completely different, although 
      the indentation from below extends into this severely corroded and apparently 
      previously indented area without any coating whatsoever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 - shows the collapsed 
      stempost area. The stempost was found to have cracked four times - see drawing 
      6 - apparently by fatigue, of which the lower crack penetrated completely 
      some time before the casualty and the lower part, F 3 on the drawing, had 
      disappeared leaving a gap in the stempost respectively a hole in the bottom 
      of the visor. The drawing No. 6 also shows that the INERTA ice paint - last 
      applied in January 1994 - had penetrated the cracks F 1, F 3 and F 4 up 
      to 50% of the thickness of the stempost. This means that the stempost had 
      been cracked through up to 50% already in January 1994. See also Subchapters 
      12.5 and 34.4.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 5.1 - shows the 
      lower forward part of the visor with the deep vertical indentation (arrow 
      2) of old origin, the gap in the stempost area caused by the ice knife on 
      top of the bulbous bow, the small indentation at the starboard side (new) 
      which is apparently casualty related and the large deep indentation at port 
      side (old) which is of old origin and was probably caused by contact with 
      ice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 7 and 8 - show 
      the bent-off starboard aft part of the bulwark. This damage occurred probably 
      when the visor was hammering on the bow ramp and the ferry was severely 
      heeled to starboard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 9 and 10 - with 
      drawing (10) incorporated show the visor bottom and arrow 1 points to the 
      indented stempost/bottom plating. The reason for this indentation was the 
      misaligned visor as indicated on the drawing, i.e. the forepart of the visor 
      overlapped the forepart of the forepeak deck to such an extent that the 
      stempost of the visor was no more resting on the stempost of the forecastle 
      deck, but that the stempost part of the forepeak deck was in contact with 
      the bottom plating of the visor which was neither designed nor dimensioned 
      to carry the weight of the visor. Therefore the bottom became firstly indented 
      and subsequently holed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Evaluation:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There were 
      2 very heavy damages in the visor which were of old origin and which had 
      led to a change of alignment and geometry of the visor when they occurred 
      which increased during the subsequent time and which has contributed to 
      the casualty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The large damage 
      to the starboard shell plating was apparently sustained in two stages, viz. 
      at first the corroded upper part occurred and subsequently the larger lower 
      part, which extends into the upper part, occurred. Since it is already rather 
      unlikely that the upper part of the damage did occur during the final stage 
      of the casualty sequence-of-events by contact with the bulbous bow, it can 
      be excluded that the 3 sharp and deep transverse indentations to the port 
      side of the centre line were caused by contact with any part of the bulbous 
      bow because there is no corresponding counter-piece. The picture below shows 
      all the indentations in the forepart of the visor. The arrow indicates the 
      3 horizontal indentations of which the upper and lower ones are rather deep. 
      It has thus to be assumed that the visor had been in contact with some other 
      object either before the casualty scenario began or after it had ended, 
      possibly during the attempts to raise the visor.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) At least 2 fatigue 
    cracks had penetrated the stempost already by about 50% when ice paint was 
    applied the last time which was between 10 and 14 January 1994 in the shipyard 
    at Naantali. During the following nine months up to the casualty the cracks 
    had to propagate further and the lowest one did fully penetrate the stempost 
    which led to the breaking away of part F 3 (see drawing below) and the creation 
    of a corresponding hole in the visor bottom and, consequently, the faster 
    flooding of the visor inside at sea.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The visor was 
    misaligned to such an extent that its forepart was overlapping the stempost 
    of the forepeak deck - see drawing behind this page and picture 9 on sheet 
    1 - which had serious consequences for all the relevant parts of the visor 
    such as locking devices, hinges, rubber packings and, last but not least, 
    the weather tightness of the visor. Nothing fitted anymore. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The drawing behind 
    this page summarizes the findings and indicates the condition of the forepeak 
    deck and the lower part of the visor including the lug of the Atlantic lock 
    before departure for the last voyage. </font></p>

      # 7 has 100 mm, # 8 has 60 mm and # 9 has 20 mm standing, while the rest 
      of that web has been deflected to port. The depth of damage (deflection) 
      is thus quite linear between webs 6 and 9. However the point of max damaged 
      paint at # 1 to max deflection at # 9 seems to follow a gentle curve dropping 
      downwards as you look to port. The ramphouse after plate with the damaged

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage configuration 
    revealed by the above measurements indicates that the visor must have been 
    misaligned by 4°-5° in forward/aft direction if the indenta-tions should have 
    occurred by contact with the bow ramp, i.e. the port side of the visor had 
    to be about 300 mm further forward than the starboard side. In other words, 
    the port side of the visor must have moved forward while the starboard side 
    was held back. Before such forward movement of the visor is possible at all 
    and contact between the aft part of the visor's ramp house and the upper part 
    of the bow ramp is possible, several initially built in obstacles have to 
    be overcome as demonstrated by the drawing on the following page.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These are:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) the lugs

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    forces necessary for the lugs to cut through this frame have been calculated 
    by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg to have been about 200 ts. This 
    means a point load of ca. 100 ts at the port side and a point load of ca. 
    100 ts at the starboard side. See Subchapter 34.12.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore, and due 
    to other circumstances, a casualty scenario as described in Chapter 31 was 
    able to develop which led to the sinking of the ESTONIA and which requires 
    a detailed examination in order to find out what actually caused the indentations 
    to webs 6 - 9 inside the ramp house of the visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage 
    is most extensive at web 9 and then decreasing until web 5 which, as well 
    as the starboard side webs 1 - 4, are not affected at all - see picture below. 
    The visor must have been misaligned by ca. 4-5° in relation to the bow ramp 
    being connected to the vessel.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg959.jpg" width="349" height="232"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The arrow indicates 
    the point of contact on web 9. The next frame 5, which is the centre line, 
    and the following frames to starboard have no marks at this level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    when web 9 came in contact with the port side of the bow ramp and was pressed 
    together from 160 mm to 20 mm the corresponding web 1 at the starboard side 
    of the ramp house was 360 ./. 160 = 200 mm away from the starboard side of 
    the bow ramp. Due to the narrow construction, such a misalignment of the visor 
    is not possible as long as the visor lugs move within the forecastle deck 
    area aft of the deck-beam at frame 159 and as long as both actuators are connected 
    to the B-deck. As will be shown on sheet P 4 + S 4 this was no more the case 
    with the foundation of the port actuator. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also visible 
    on the two pictures above are slight scorings inside the ramp house from web 
    1 through web 9 which could indicate a slight contact at another time, earlier 
    or later (see red arrows on both pictures). The scoring marks are just below 
    the brackets between vertical/horizontal webs which would be the areas of 
    contact when visor and bow ramp are in normal condition as on the drawings. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the points 
    of deepest indentation on webs 6 through 9 are, however, located about 300 
    mm deeper, this indicates that the visor was at its normal height at the time 
    of this contact, but raised by about this distance in relation to the upper 
    part of the bow ramp. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There is, however, 
    the much more realistic possibility that the port side of the bow ramp came 
    in contact with this particular area inside the ramp house when the visor 
    was hanging on the ramp at a rather late stage of the casualty scenario. Then 
    the vessel was on the side and the visor was close to sliding off the ramp 
    due to the vessel heeling some 120°/130°. This will be explained in Chapter 
    31 - The Casualty Scenario. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper 
    transverse crossbar inside the visor shows respective damage - see arrow 1 
    on the picture below - the corresponding part at the port outer longitudinal 
    girder of the bow ramp does not. This is confirmed by the image further down,

    ramp, at least not at an early stage as explained before. The damage must 
    have been caused when the visor was labouring on the ramp for more than 30 
    minutes until the heel of the vessel was sufficiently big to let the visor

    for the middle one the respective areas cannot be reached by the bow ramp. 
    It has to be assumed that these scorings were caused by other means before 
    the casualty. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg963.jpg" width="426" height="277"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The indentations/scorings 
    at the vertical beam are discussed in<b> item 8 - Internal Structure</b>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the 
    before mentioned the following has been established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There may 
      have been a previous however light contact between visor and bow ramp when 
      both were in normal condition to each other. Such contact could not be explained 
      by this 'Group of Experts', because contact between ramp and ramp house 
      under normal conditions is only possible if the visor hinges are broken 
      or disconnected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) There has 
      however been a stronger contact between the port side of the bow ramp and 
      the port webs of the ramp house only when the visor was misaligned in relation 
      to the bow ramp by ca. 4°, i.e. the port side of the visor was about 300 
      mm more forward than the starboard side, a condition which was only possible 
      after the hinges had failed and the lugs under-neath the visor arms had 
      broken through the deck beam at frame 159. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) This is supported 
      by the apparent fact that the bow ramp was not locked and the visor was 
      water-filled to the outboard level and was weighing about 200 ts, instead 
      of 55 ts in empty condition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The bow ramp 
      did not crash into the visor onto the cross-beam at 1st stringer level and 
      did not cause the respective damage on port side because neither the corresponding 
      part of the bow ramp nor the corresponding part of the starboard side of 
      the same cross-beam do show any damage of similar nature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Consequently 
      the bow ramp was not pulled open when the contact occurred which caused 
      the indentations/scorings to the four port webs in the aft part of the ramp 
      house. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It has however 
      to be assumed that this contact occurred in the final stage when the visor 
      separated from the vessel and the bow ramp was kicked up by the port aft 
      bottom part of the visor as it will be explained in Chapter 31 - The Casualty 
      Scenario. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally attention 
    has to be drawn to one indentation pushed at each side into the forward deck 
    beam of the visor, i.e. the lower side of the forward part of the ramp house 
    as indicated on the two pictures on the next page. According to drawing on 
    page 956 the port indentation is 240 mm away from the inner bulkhead and the 
    starboard one 325 m. This means that these indentations were most probably 
    caused by the bell cranks being the most upwards extending parts of the bow 
    ramp. This must have occurred at a time when the visor was hanging on the 
    bow ramp already, i.e. the contact area having been the part inner bulkhead. 
    Therefore the distance between bow ramp and port inner bulkhead has as small 
    as possible - 240 mm - while the opposite distance between the bow ramp and 
    the starboard inner bulkhead was as big as possible - 325 mm. This is also 
    the explanation for the apparent fact that the port inner bulkhead was very 
    severely distorted and partly cracked while the starboard inner bulkhead remained 
    completely unaffected even without paint scratches. See also S 4 and P4 - 
    The Inner Bulkheads - further down.</font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The intact

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The deep scorings 
      at both the outer and the inner lug plates indicate that the starboard hinge 
      broke earlier, i.e. when the vessel either - was only slightly heeling to 
      starboard as it had been the case for the last hour, or - was already rolling 
      to both sides - though more to starboard than to port - about 1 or 2 minutes 
      before the big heel to starboard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The scorings 
      at the outer plate are, however, deeper and more extensive indicating that 
      there has been heavier and longer contact between this plate and the steel 
      parts cut through which was most probably caused by the increasing heel

    </font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The welding seams 
      between bushing and hinge plate are of poor quality and only 7-8 mm thick 
      whereas the originals were about 15 mm thick. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The same welding 
      seams apparently cracked frequently and it had been attempted to close the 
      cracks by welding which resulted in welding material penetrating through 
      the cracks into the gap between the hinge plate and bushing. See arrows 
      1 on pictures a and c.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The surface of 
      the bushing in way of the hinge plate shows corrosion which indicates that 
      the space between bushing/hinge plate, which should be sealed airtight by 
      the welding seams, had not been airtight anymore for some time already obviously 
      due to the crack propagation in the too thin welding seams and/or due to

      and after the cracks had penetrated 50-60% of the material the remaining

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The surface of 
      the bushing, corresponding to the inside of the hinge plate with the burning 
      marks explained above, does not show burning marks, therefore it has to 
      be assumed that the original bushing was burned out some time before the 
      casualty and replaced by the present one.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The gap between 
      bushing and hinge plate in way of the fracture area was about 25 mm indicating 
      that the bushing did not fit into the hole of the hinge plate because the

    after 10-12 years. </font></p>

    ascertained that these scorings were extending over about 180°, although the 
    bolt should move inside the (shrinked) fixed bushing only over 90° in accordance 
    with the movement of the visor. This means that the bronze bushing which should 
    be fixed inside the steel bushing had been turning, i.e. had not been sufficiently

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The recovered 
      steel and bronze bushings as well as the securing plate are not original. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The welding 
      seams between visor hinge plate and steel bushing are consequently also 
      not original which is also confirmed by the weak dimensions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The welding 
      seams were cracked and an attempt had been made to close the cracks by welding 
      which resulted in welding material penetrating through the crack into the 
      much too big gap between the hinge plate and steel bushing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The space 
      between the hinge plate and steel bushing shows heavy corrosion which indicates 
      that the welding seams had been cracked and penetrated some considerable 
      time before the casualty and, consequently, the much too big space between 
      hinge plate and steel bushing was exposed to the outside air and wetness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The inside 
      of the hinge plate was covered by deep burning marks whereas the outer surface 
      of the steel bushing was unaffected. Consequently the old steel bushing 
      had been burned out by flame-cutting. Each burning mark is a crack starter 
      from where cracks propagated into the hinge plate material to various depth. 
      This led to further weakening of the hinges and to a considerable reduction 
      of the load carrying capacity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) Also the bronze 
      bushing was installed rather unprofessionally and not shrunk in as it was 
      done at newbuilding. - See the statements of G.Todsen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      2.4.2.21</a>. After it was noted that the bronze bushing turned inside the

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer 
      lug plate is completely untouched while the inner lug plate shows very deeply 
      engraved scraping marks. This means that at the time when the lug plates 
      were cutting through the deck plating and the deck beam the vessel must 
      have heeled already considerably to starboard. Therefore the centre of gravity 
      of the visor had shifted from forward to starboard and the force direction 
      was no more to forward/downwards but starboard/downwards. Thus the weight 
      of the visor in athwartships direction was now carried by the inner port 
      and the outer starboard lug plates because the locating horns gave no more 
      transverse support as the visor had moved too much forward.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) As the lug 
      plates underneath the starboard visor arm were both badly affected, the

      but rolling and consequently both the inner and the outer hinge plates were 
      affected. The port hinges remained intact for the time being. The starboard 
      side of the visor moved - in slightly raised condition - forward/aft a couple 
      of times when the vessel was still only slightly heeling to starboard and 
      was rolling, whereafter the starboard heel increased considerably and also 
      the port hinges broke. Only thereafter also the port lug plate started to 
      cut first through the deck plating and then through the deck beams. At that 
      time the heel to starboard must have been that big already that the outer

    The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty 
    due to load changes during opening/closing of the visor and did most probably 
    propagate more quickly during the last month before the casualty because of

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following photograph 
    shows the port visor actuator foundation after parts had been cut out for 
    testing purposes. The foundation lies on its port outer lug plate. In the

    since the last repair was never really fitted to it, is further confirmed 
    by a part of the welding seam - see arrow 8 - on the previous two photos - 
    apparently being soaked with oil while the stiffener below is unaffected. 
    This means that this stiffener was not welded to the B-deck.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the 
    following facts are considered to be established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer 
      stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old temporary repair 
      with very poor welding seems in its forward part. Due to the corrosion visible 
      on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this improper repair was 
      carried out already some considerable time before the casualty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The stiffeners 
      show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward and the aft ends 
      of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the stiffeners 
      were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. The cracks had developed 
      during some considerable time before the casualty due to load changes during 
      the opening and closing of the visor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The B-deck 
      was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the stiffeners. This 
      fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck remains. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The port inner 
      stiffener was no more the original one since firstly it did not show any 
      protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded to the deck - if at 
      all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the deck by the shipyard 
      during new-building, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The load carrying 
      capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably reduced. </font></p>

    another remarkable difference between the condition of the port and starboard

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that it

    - see picture above. The piston rod shows some scoring marks but no particular 
    damage, certainly no heavy damages on the starboard side as can be seen on 
    the piston rod of the port actuator. The scoring marks on the piston rod may 
    have been caused at any time during the long process of separation from the 
    vessel. This does not allow the conclusion that the lifting cylinder had been 
    opened when the actuator was still attached to B-deck, i.e. that the visor 
    opened to some extent, although this has to be assumed because of the unaffected 
    rubber packings around the actuator opening - see above. </font></p>

      have been under pressure at or just before the time of the casualty, most 
      likely because the crew was trying to hold down the visor by the actuators 
      but the port one broke off due to the poor connection to B-deck.</font></p>

      being the thickest part with direct contact to bulkhead and internals during 
      the breaking through process. Therefore cover and screws show severe hammering 
      marks and the clamping ring is missing which was probably stripped off the 
      piston when it was pulled through the bulkhead. Also the damage picture 
      of the port front bulkhead - see P 4 in Chapter 29 - does confirm the above

    2 - had not been torn out of the bulkhead during the casualty scenario but 
    much earlier because, due to the thickness of the accumulated welding seams, 
    this original part of the visor bulkhead (Viking Line colour) could not come 
    in contact with the adjacent visor plating. Consequently, it has to be assumed 
    that each time the lug was cut off by burning it was just stuck into the respective

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The plating 
      around<b> the starboard</b> opening looks completely different because the 
      plating is distorted, the stiffener at the inside is torn off the bulkhead, 
      the plating had apparently been exposed to heat and subsequently became 
      corroded. The steel part between the small hole and the bigger opening was 
      pushed upwards, obviously by the lug then and still attached to the vessel, 
      i.e. the visor made a downward movement in relation to the lug, i.e. the 
      vessel. Thereby the lug was pressed into said steel part. The indication 
      of the remnant of a welding seam is visible at the upper right corner of 
      the big opening. Otherwise there are no indications of welding seams at 
      all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lugs of 
      the visor's side locks were obviously not welded to the plating, but there 
      were permanent holes in the plating of both sides through which the lugs 
      were stuck and welded from the inside only. Thereby it was possible to adjust 
      the part of the lugs extending the plating to the length required by the 
      ever changing misalignment of the visor. </font></p>

      load carrying capacity of this lock to a fraction of the original.</font></p>

      end of the aft bulkhead is partly crushed, partly torn and on the outside 
      a deep fold in way of the contact area with the rubber packings of the corresponding

    by many previous passengers that the crew was unable to open the locking devices, 
    neither hydraulically nor by force - see Subchapter 12.4 - and then the next 
    step was to take the burning gear and cut off the lug. Subsequently the lug 
    was rewelded time and again and apparently only from the inside of the visor 
    but always without grinding off the old remnants, in other words: totally 
    improfessional.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This confirms the

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Due to the 
      vertical misalignment of the visor the port side of the visor was raised 
      by 100 or more mm which made it impossible for the locating horn fitted 
      at the port front bulkhead of the vessel to enter the mating pocket of the 
      visor. Instead contact occurred in the area below the pocket - as the visor 
      was raised - and the plating became damaged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The crew fitted 
      several doublers and support brackets in way to compensate for the stress 
      created by the misalignment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lug of 
      the hydraulic side lock including the plating part to which it was welded 
      had apparently been cut off and rewelded several times without grinding 
      off the remnants of the previous welding seams. This led to the very thick 
      welds with substantially reduced load carrying capacity of the side locking 
      device of the visor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The rubber 
      packings in way of the area below the pockets for the locating horn were 
      either missing at the front bulkhead of the vessel or had not been in contact 
      with the corresponding parts of the visor bulkhead due to misalignment. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The area around 
      the location of the lug of the hydraulic side lock is not pushed out, nor 
      do smoke marks exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The hooks of 
      the manual side lock are just slightly bent together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The recess 
      at the upper part of the port aft bulkhead of the visor was damaged when 
      the visor was moving transversely respectively athwartships. </font></p>

    overlapped the forepeak deck considerably to the effect that the forepeak 
    deck had penetrated the inside of the visor bottom up to ca. 0.5 m. This must 
    have given the visor the main support against falling off to starboard, because

    bow ramp. The deep crack in the bottom of the visor to port of the lug confirms 
    this. It further indicates that the visor lug was about to crack off the visor 
    bottom when the lugs on the forepeak deck failed first. This is underlined 
    by the impressive picture below indicating an upwards and to starboard movement 
    of the visor when this big crack propagated and came to a stop when the lugs 
    on the forepeak deck failed. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following facts 
    are considered to be established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The visor 
      bottom had overlapped the forepeak deck which penetrated deeply into the 
      bottom structure of the visor which supported the visor during the increasing 
      heel of the vessel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The gap in 
      way of the collapsed stempost of the visor was caused when this part fell 
      on top of the ice knife on top of the bulbous bow. The very strong ice plates 
      consequently bent up to both sides of the collapsed stempost provided further 
      support to the visor and also prevented its falling off to starboard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The scoring/scraping 
      marks inside the pocket for the pyramid do confirm the vertical and forward/aft 
      misalignment of the visor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The very sharp 
      damage at the port aft edge of the visor bottom was caused when the visor 
      moved athwartships in the final stage of gliding off the bow ramp, the forepeak 
      deck and finally the bulbous bow to the bottom of the sea. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The visor lug 
      of the Atlantic lock almost cracked off at the bottom when the visor moved 
      forwards and to starboard, however, then the lugs of the forepeak deck broke 
      first and the crack propagation stopped. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The visor lug 
      was considerably elongated due to wear in 141/2 years of exposure to changing 
      loads and the manipulations by Christer Koivisto.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (7) The basic 
      primer of the visor lug is yellow which is an indication that it is still 
      the original lug as the initial primer at newbuilding was of such colour. 
      See also Subchapter 2.4.6. The basic primer of the starboard lug of the 
      Atlantic lock was found to be grey by the JAIC which is a further confirmation 
      that this as well as the other two lugs were not the original ones anymore. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(8) The stempost was cracked 
      4 times well before the casualty and the crack had penetrated the stempost 
      up to 50% of its thickness at the time of the casualty. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    that these deep indentations cannot have been caused when the port actuator 
    was swinging inside the longitudinal inner bulkhead (due to the existing starboard 
    list of visor and vessel) and got jammed there, as evident from the picture 
    below. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the actuator 
    had been dismounted by MacGregor, Turku in February 1995 the area looked as 
    it is shown by the following picture. Arrow 1 indicates the area at the edge 
    of aft and inner bulkheads where the aft bulkhead is slightly extending the 
    inner bulkhead and where metal parts were torn off when the actuator moved 
    into its jammed positions. A detailed evaluation of this and other pictures 
    did reveal that neither the actuator nor its foundation had come in contact 
    with the bulkhead which is due to the angle between the fastening point at 
    the lugs below the visor arm and the bulkhead edge. The actuator was able 
    to swing into this position because of its spherical bearings which allow 
    deviation of up to 15° to each side. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is thus proven 
    with sufficient certainty that the severe damage as well as the scraping and 
    scoring marks were only caused by the bow ramp then lying inside the visor 
    on the beam structure and the visor resting on the bow ramp in way of the 
    damage area under discussion. This shall be explained in more detail in Chapter 
    31 - The Casualty Scenario. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The picture below 
    shows the port inner side of the visor with the slightly damaged frames at 
    the port aft part of the ramp house. The upper part of the longitudinal bulkhead 
    is completely unaffected. The scorings and the deep indentations and deformation 
    (arrow 2) are restricted to the middle part, and, in the foreground, the vertical 
    beam which had been in contact with the upper part of the ramp with the folded 
    flap in between is visible (arrow 1). </font></p>

    - due to the starboard heel - remained obviously unaffected even during final

    Casualty Scenario.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently the

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The upper 
      and the lower parts of the port inner bulkhead of the visor are completely 
      unaffected, the middle part however is very severely scraped, indented and 
      cracked which was caused by the bow ramp when the visor was resting on it. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The above-mentioned 
      damage was exclusively caused by the bow ramp, the port actuator has not 
      been in contact with the bulkhead plating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The opposite 
      starboard inner longitudinal bulkhead is completely unaffected, thus there 
      has been no contact with the bow ramp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The above 
      explained severe damage at the port inner longitudinal bulkhead in connection 
      with corresponding damage at the port bow ramp - see Subchapter 29.2 - The 
      Bow Area - and witness evidence - see Enclosures 29.6.414 / 29.6.415 - confirms 
      that the visor had been resting on the bow ramp which caused the damage 
      to the port inner bulkhead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Due to the 
      absence of damage/scorings forward and aft of the existing damage approximately 
      in the middle of the port inner bulkhead it has to be assumed that the visor 
      fell off the bow ramp / forepeak deck towards the starboard side by force 
      of gravity once the heel was sufficient, i.e. 130°/140°.</font></p>

    on the vertical beam which took the main weight of the ramp. Arrows 1 and 
    3 indicate the damage respectively scoring marks on the cross-beam which cannot 
    have been caused by the bow ramp at the early stage, because there is no corresponding 
    damage at the ramp and, also, the lower parts, being almost at the underside

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation 
    for these marks respectively damage on the cross-beam on both sides can be 
    seen on the drawing 3., i.e. contact with the bell cranks on both sides at 
    the top of the ramp already before the casualty when the visor opened/closed 
    due to the slightly open and misaligned ramp (could no more be properly closed) 
    and the misaligned visor. In particular the port bell crank is damaged very 
    severely which was, of course, mainly caused by the contact with the port 
    inner bulkhead of the visor. On the other hand, it has to be assumed that 
    this already existing damage was exaggerated when the ramp was inside the 
    visor and the visor hanging on the ramp.</font></p>

    the very severely set up visor bottom which is underlined by the close-up 
    No. 10 and explained by detail drawing No. 8. There are two further contact 
    marks in way of the deck beam at the lower forward part of the ramp house, 
    viz. in the most port and most starboard frame spaces, which were evidently 
    also caused by the bell cranks of the ramp when the visor moved further forward

      fitted on both sides at the top of the bow ramp. </font></p>

      two contact marks at the deck beam below the forward part of the ramp house,

    deck - see Sheet 7 in Chapter 29.2 - the inside of the visor quickly filled 
    with water to the outer level. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water level 
    inside the visor was raising the deeper the bow was pitching into the waves 
    coming in from port forward. Simultaneously water penetrated to the car deck 
    at the port lower side of the bow ramp in spite of the "sealing material" 
    stuffed into the big gap by the crew. - See drawings on the following page 
    1051.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the end 
    of the TSS off Suurupi Lighthouse the course was changed to 262° and the ferry 
    proceeded with all 4 main engines on full output along the Estonian North 
    coast. Due to the increasing south-westerly gale the ferry heeled 2-4° to 
    starboard and was pitching harder and harder. - See Chapter 30. Passengers 
    started to feel unwell and several became seasick.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even with 
    calm sea the water level inside the visor was rising above the 3rd stringer<br>
    when the vessel was at full speed. The lower side of the bow ramp was below<br>
    3rd stringer level, thus even in clam sea the water from the visor was penetrating<br>
    the gap in the bow ramp and was flooding onte the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of 
    the following 1 - 1,5 hours the bow was diving increasingly deeper into the 
    wave troughs and finally the foreship was shipping green water onto the forecastle 
    deck. Therefore, it has to be assumed that the visor had been filled up with 
    water up to the 1st stringer level or even higher. This means that the weight 
    of the visor increased from 55 ts to approximately 200 ts which had, among 
    other things, the effect that the 0,5 m stern trim might have been reduced.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the 
    high water column inside the visor and the respective pressure on the unsecured 
    ramp the port lower corner of which being plugged with "sealing material" 
    the water quantities penetrating the gaps and streaming onto the car deck 
    were increasing and accumulating at starboard to which side the vessel was 
    continuously heeling since departure the scuppers at the starboard side being 
    most likely unable to swallow all the water streaming into the car deck. To 
    avoid the worst the crew seems to have opened the starboard stern ramp slightly 
    and have kept it in such condition by means of the ice braking cylinders against 
    which the ramp was pressed by the actuators to maintain the gap through which 
    water was flowing from the car deck. The resulting high pitch hydraulic noise 
    created by the aft hydraulic pumps disturbed the conference held on the 4th 
    deck above to such an effect that it had to be closed down at about 20.45 
    hours. -See the statement of Rolf Sörman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    time already low metallic banging noises had been noted by several passengers 
    throughout the ship but, in particular, by those in the foreship area and

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A little later the 
    stabilisers were activated from the bridge, but it appeared that the starboard 
    one did not move out of its pocket which was located about midships on 0-deck

    and have tried to hammer it out by means of sledge hammers. See the statement

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about 00.40/45 
    hours 1-2 heavy bangs, crashed were felt when the watchman A. B. Silver Linde 
    came again to the car deck and must have seen big quantities of water moving 
    between the cars and trucks, with personal cars already floating around in 
    the forepart of the deck. Due to the heavily and hard labouring vessel there 
    must have been heavy movement of the water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Silver Linde alarmed 
    the bridge at once by walkie-talkie shouting that there was much more water 
    on the car deck and they had to leave the vessel. This was overheard by safety 
    officer Ervin Roden, who had his walkie-talkie switched on when he was in

    told him to send the boatswain with some deckhands down to try to rectify 
    the situation. Most likely the chief mate and the chief engineer were also 
    called to the bridge and the 2nd mate Peeter Kannuussaar sent down to the

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the very weak 
    condition of visor and bow ramp were with certainty known to the vessel's 
    command, the speed was reduced and the bow slowly turned to starboard in an 
    attempt to reduce the load on the visor and to avoid green water on to the 
    forecastle deck, because crew members had to work also there and had to enter 
    the port side house from there as it was certainly not possible to reach the 
    control panel from the centre casing. It was necessary for crew members to 
    get to the forward port side of the car deck to the control panel to activate 
    the hydraulic pumps in order to close the bow ramp best terms possible and 
    probably also to hold the visor down hydraulically. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel made slower 
    but deeper pitch movements due to the speed reduction, but the rolling increased 
    dangerously when the vessel got into or almost into beam seas. To reduce the 
    rolling the ferry was turned back to port. The vessel was again in head seas, 
    the heavy rolling stopped, but the deep pitch movements increased again and 
    green water was taken on the forecastle, whereafter the crew had to abandon 
    their attempts to close the bow ramp by heaving the mooring line. The bow 
    ramp was then held by the actuators which, however, could only close the ramp 
    to a final opening of about 5 cm. Thus water continued to stream onto the 
    car deck and there was nothing the crew could do about it. It has to be assumed 
    that the nautical advisor, Captain Juri Aavik, was also on the car deck/on 
    the forecastle deck doing his utmost to get the situation under control, however 
    in vain. It has further to be assumed that the 2nd mate and/or the boatswain 
    informed the bridge continuously about the situation on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Simultaneously the 
    engine crew was working on the starboard stabiliser fin and sledge hammer 
    noises were heard all the time. A further consequence of the vessel pitching 
    against high seas from forward was the load increase on the visor attachments 
    which had already been increased by about 150 ts of water moving forward/aft 
    and side to side inside the visor. This caused the failure of the starboard 
    visor hinge followed by the failure of the starboard side lock of the visor. 
    - See the drawings on page 1062. Both components were considerably pre-damaged 
    - see Subchapters 12.4.3/12.5 and Chapters 29/30 - and the load carrying capacity 
    was substantially reduced. See also Subchapter 34.4. The Atlantic lock remained 
    intact for the time being.</font></p>

    banging noises scaring many passengers. The lug plates underneath the starboard 
    visor arm came in contact with the adjacent plating and sustained scoring 
    marks on the inside and on the outside because the vessel was only slightly 
    heeled to starboard, still pitching in head seas and only slightly rolling. 
    The port visor hinges remained intact for the time being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the disappearing

    situation is illustrated by the drawings on the following pages. The dynamic 
    forces created by the deep pitch movements of the vessel in combination with 
    the movement of the big water quantity inside the visor and the weight of

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In April 1995 the 
    JAIC published the <i>"PART-Report covering technical issues on the capsizing 
    on 28 September 1994 in the Baltic Sea of the ro-ro passenger vessel MV Estonia" 
    </i>which included also certain picture material, among others the picture 
    below showing the aft part of the visor bottom with the visor lug being part 
    of the Atlantic lock.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The blue coloured 
    part of the lug - see arrow - looked as if having been exposed to heat which 
    was unusual since this part had been below water. The JAIC was contacted and 
    it turned out that samples had been taken already on 25 November 1994 and 
    had been examined upon request of the Central Criminal Police in Finland and 
    Kari Lethola as chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC on 30.03.95. The 
    tests were carried out on 30.05.95 by the Criminal Laboratory Technical Division, 
    Helsinki. The "available" documentation was received - already translated 
    into English - from Kari Lethola.</font></p>

    is obvious that such a surface test would result in nothing because the samples

    of the methods applied by the laboratory when the objects have been under 
    water for more than one week. It would, even today and in 20 years time, be 
    possible to prove explosion damage by scientific methods by means of which 
    the destroyed molecular structure is examined. This, however, was not done

    In sample No. 7 were paint splinters with paint layer structure that was different 
    from the bow mentioned because lots of grey and blue epox paint had been rubbed 
    on the top white paint layer. This epox paint was when it comes to the pigment 
    and the component type to its chemical structure of the same type as the Inerta 
    160 epox colour, that had been manufactured in the laboratory from the samples 
    8. and 9.« </font></i></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These are the 
    only known activities in connection with explosives which were incurred by 
    the Authorities involved in the casualty investigation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No further information 
    relating to explosives having possibly been on board the ESTONIA on her last 
    voyage were received until approximately mid 1996 when rumours were circulating 
    that there was a big hole in the starboard side of the hull in way of sauna 
    and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck. The information came at first from 
    some source in the upper middle management of Sjöfartsverket. A check of the 
    available video material - see Chapters 25-28 - revealed that the respective 
    parts on all video tapes had been cut out - see Subchapter 34.6 - Disengage 
    Report. A review of the statements of the survivors from the 1st deck having 
    been rather close to the area in question did not allow definite conclusions 
    until it was possible to talk to one of them personally. This was Carl Övberg 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151</a> and Subchapter 12.4.2 - who explained among other things that 
    he saw water escaping under high pressure from the goose-necks fitted to two 
    ventilation pipes coming up from 0-deck. He made this observation about 1 
    minute after the 3rd and most most heavy shock, vibration of the vessel but 
    about 30 seconds before the big heel to starboard. This allows the conclusion 
    that at least the 0-deck compartment directly below Carl Övberg must have 
    been flooded and under pressure.This indicated a connection to the outside, 
    i.e. a hole in the hull, in way of 0-deck as otherwise the compartment could 
    not have been under pressure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This scenario was 
    among other things also presented at the first and second exhibition organised 
    by this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997 when the 
    complete investigation results were presented to the national and international 
    public and media. Among the many pieces of information received during these 
    exhibitions there were also explanations regarding possible explosions on 
    board.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a relatively 
    silent 1998 when most of the interested people were analysing and subsequently 
    criticising the report of the JAIC a new person appeared in Sweden apparently 
    with sufficient time, and an undisturbed mind, to analyse again all the publicly 
    available video footage and documentation on this subject collected by the 
    JAIC. He found among other things on the video B40b, made by the SPRINT ROV 
    on 03.12.94, a package on the port superstructure in way of the 5th deck which 
    appeared suspicious to him. Video images were made and shown among others 
    also to experts in explosives in Sweden and Germany. See the following image.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1099.jpg" width="345" height="248"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both identified the 
    package with about 90% certainty to be an explosive charge used underwater.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Evaluation 
    of the footage made by ROV on 02. and 09.10.94 revealed, however, that the 
    package had not been at the identified location on the 5th deck on these dates, 
    thus must have been placed there between the 09.10. and 03.12.94 and therefore 
    could not be casualty related.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    the term "explosives", which had always been in the background during the 
    preceding years of the investigation, was suddenly brought back to the attention 
    of the investigators and the video footage available in Hamburg, all obtained 
    from the JAIC, was analysed again also in an attempt to find possible explanations 
    for numerous so far unexplained damage areas. It revealed among other things 
    that an orange coloured cube had been attached to the recess of the port front 
    bulkhead of the wreck in way of the hydraulic and manual side locks and the 
    fastening of the bow ramp actuator. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cube was clearly 
    visible and had been closely looked at by the ROV during the inspection on 
    09.10.94, it could not, however, be found on the 02.10.94 videos which was 
    possibly due to restricted visibility and was definitely not in this location 
    on the SPRINT ROV made on 03.12.94 respectively on the diver video of the 
    same date.<br>
    Images were made from the orange coloured cube and identified by all three 
    experts from Sweden, England and Germany with a high degree of probability 
    as an<b> "explosive charge"</b>. See the following two images. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As this charge attached 
    in way of a very sensitive area - the port side locking devices of the visor 
    and the fastening of the port bow ramp actuator - obviously did not explode, 
    the corresponding area of the starboard side was analysed for possible explosion 
    damage which was positively identified by the underwater explosive expert 
    Brian Braidwood. This resulted in a further analysis of the available video 
    footage all received from the JAIC. The results are outlined in the following 
    subchapters. </font></p>

    all car/passenger ferries with bow doors were closely inspected as soon as 
    possible whenever they arrived in a Swedish or Finnish ports. It is unknown 
    whether this procedure was also carried out in the Estonian ports. From Sweden 
    it is only known that reportedly 28 vessels were found to have serious defects 
    to their bow-door arrangements. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From Finland 
    the following report was received:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The bow and 
      stern doors of all the Finnish passenger/Ro-Ro cargo/ ferries have been

      (F.B.N.).<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two 
      vessels were stopped for repairs. The locking arrangements have been welded 
      into closed position on board the ferries which run between Helsinki-Stockholm, 
      Helsinki-Travemünde and Vaasa-Sundsvall, and also on board the ferries which 
      are cruising in the Northern Baltic.<br>
      A special Port State Control Survey has been carried out on board all the 
      passenger ships which are regularly trading to the Finnish ports. Captain 
      Veikki Inkinen, Chief Maritime Inspector of the Gulf of Finland Maritime 
      District, informed that two main categories of damage to the locking devices 
      were found:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1. Fatigue 
      fractures. <br>

      mm) due to extensive wear. Also corrosion damages were found.<br>
      The inspectors found damage to almost every ship's bow visor's locking devices.<br>
      Maritime Inspector Tom Sommerdal surveyed about 10 vessels in Helsinki. 
      Also he found wear and tear damages in the lugs and bolts of the locking 
      devices of the bow visors. Also leakages in the hydraulic systems were noted.<br>
      The vessels under Estonian flag were in worse condition than those under 
      Finnish flag.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the 
    Swedish government instructed already on the<b> 03.10.94</b> the previous 
    Supreme Court Judge <b>Magnus Sjöberg</b> to carry out an internal investigation 
    of the National Maritime Administration for Shipping and Navigation - Sjöfartsverket 
    - and, in particular, its Sjöfartsinspektionen - The Shipping Inspection (Shipinspec). 
    This investigation covered among other things the subjects 1) to 3) stated 
    on the previous page and was performed on basis of a Government decision defined 
    as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 28 September 
      1994, the passenger ferry Estonia foundered south-west of Utö in Finland 
      en route from Tallinn to Stockholm. The vessel was flying the Estonian flag. 
      On 29 September 1994, the Government commissioned the Board of Accident 
      Investigation to assist in the accident inquiry. A joint accident board 
      was then formed, with representatives from the Estonian, Finnish and Swedish 
      authorities. One of the main functions of this board is to establish the 
      reason for the accident.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Survivors 
      of this maritime disaster have stated that the vessel's bow "visor" was 
      torn away, which is supposed to have been an important cause of the sinking. 
      <br>
      Information has since emerged to the effect that incidents and problems 
      with bow doors have occurred previously with ferries of the same type as 
      the Estonia. A high standard of safety at sea demands that the necessary 
      conclusions are regularly drawn from incidents and accidents that occur. 
      In addition to the investigation now being carried out by the joint accident 
      board (JAIC), other matters should be dealt with including the reporting 
      routines within the Shipinspec. <br>
      The Government commissions former Judge of the Supreme Court Magnus Sjöberg 
      to carry out such a survey. As part of this, the investigator is to examine 
      how information relevant to maritime safety is analysed and promulgated 
      within the department, and where necessary put forward proposals for improvements. 
      The investigator is also to look at the options for and the frequency of 
      exchange of relevant maritime safety information between maritime safety 
      authorities and other bodies that have important functions in the field 
      of maritime safety, such as classification societies, insurers and shipowners' 
      associations. Finally, the investigator should examine how such information 
      exchange takes place between Shipinspec or corresponding bodies within our 
      local region, and where necessary put forward proposals as to how this might 
      be improved. <br>
      The investigator shall carry out his work in contact with the JAIC and in 
      co-operation with the special committee on increased maritime safety for 
      ferry services that the Government will be setting up.<br>
      The Government authorises the Minister of Communications to appoint a secretary 
      or other assistant to the investigator.<br>

    It comprises 58 pages and deals exclusively with the conditions existing before 
    and at the time of the ESTONIA accident and among other things the investigator 
    has closely looked into the history of bow door failures and associated incidents 
    as they were reflected in the various files of the different Sjöfartinspektionen 
    offices - not at a central register - of which some shall be explained below:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a) The car/passenger 
    ferry "VISBY"<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry VISBY was built in 1972 and had a gross tonnage of 6665 registered tons. 
    On 12 November 1973 on its ordinary run between Nynäshamn and Visby, the forebody 
    of the ship was struck by heavy seas. The result was that the bow door opened 
    and water was shipped on the car deck. The master therefore decided to turn 
    the vessel back to Nynäshamn. This event took place after the vessel had come 
    out into the open sea. There was a high wind and heavy sea at the time. On 
    survey of the damage it was found that both of the locking hooks of the bow 
    door had been broken off and indentations were left on the door. As a temporary 
    measure the bow door and cargo ramp were welded to the hull. After the repair 
    had been water-tested and surveyed by the relevant Classification Society, 
    Lloyds Register of Shipping, the vessel received temporary permission to continue 
    trading until the next yard inspection. In February 1974 permanent repairs 
    were carried out, in which the bow door received new locking hooks of heavier 
    dimensions than previously, and the locking device was further reinforced 
    by shroud screws with lashing attachments.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec's 
    conclusion about the cause of the accident, as stated in the investigation 
    report dated 1 November 1974, was that the bow door locking devices were of 
    too weak construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) "STENA SAILER" 
    <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Ro-Ro 
    cargo ship STENA SAILER was built in 1973 and had a gross registered tonnage 
    of 2872. On a voyage between Zeebrügge and Dover on 16 January 1974 with a 
    cargo of trailers and transport lorries, the vessel encountered heavy weather 
    with increasing opposing seas. The vessel reduced its speed, but the strong 
    sea broke apart the locking devices of the forward bow door, and lifted it 
    out of closed position. The space between the bow door and the bow ramp was 
    filled with water. The ramp was therefore secured using six chains. In order 
    to avoid additional damage, the vessel was hove to and subsequently Rotterdam 
    was called on as port of refuge where a temporary repairs were carried out. 
    The locking mechanism and hoisting arms of the bow door had been damaged, 
    and the port side ramp hydraulic actuators had become unusable after the failure 
    of the operating rod attachment. The investigation report of Shipinspec dated 
    12 December 1974 found that the cause of the accident was the took weak constructions 
    of the locking devices of ramp and bow door.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(c) "SVEA STAR"</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">SVEA STAR, 
    a car/passenger ferry built in 1968 with a gross registered tonnage of 9963, 
    was registered with Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Between Travemünde and Helsingborg 
    on 5 May 1974, the vessel encountered heavy weather and rising seas. A particularly 
    heavy sea struck the vessel, breaking the forward locking devices and extra 
    securings and lifting up the bow door. Water collected between the forward 
    door and the ramp. The vessel returned to Travemünde for damage inspection.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey 
    it was found that all three hydraulic locking devices were completely damaged, 
    and even the extra securing with two 2-inch turnbuckles had been torn apart. 
    No damage was evident to the actual door or ramp. The locking devices were 
    temporarily repaired and surveyed two days later in Helsingborg by both the 
    Classification Society and the Department.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec 
    investigation report dated 12 December 1974 states that in the opinion of 
    the master, of the Classification Society and of the Department the accident 
    was due to the too weak construction of the locking devices of the bow door. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(d) "SAGA STAR" 
    </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry SAGA STAR, with a gross registered tonnage of 8226, was built in 1981. 
    On 6 May 1982 the vessel was about to sail from Travemünde to Helsingborg. 
    The weather was calm. When the bow visor was closed the port hinge failed 
    which caused the port side of the visor to fall down four meters. The hydraulic 
    hinges broke and oil leaked out. Immediately afterwards the starboard hinge 
    failed too and the entire visor fell down . After having been surveyed by 
    Lloyd's Register of Shipping, the vessel was given a permit to proceed to 
    Helsingborg - via Malmö - without its bow visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey 
    damage to the visor and its attachments to the hull, and hull damage between 
    ramp and visor was ascertained. It was stated in the Shipinspec investigation 
    report that the accident was probably due to the visor hinges having been 
    of insufficient dimensions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(e) "STENA JUTLANDICA" 
    </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry STENA JUTLANDICA was built in 1983, with a gross registered tonnage 
    of 15 811. On 12 October 1984, STENA JUTLANDICA was berthed at Fredrikshamn. 
    When the bow door was opened, the port hinge of the bow door failed and the 
    bow door fell down a bout 2 metres. After having been lifted back into position, 
    the door was welded in place. A permanent repair was carried out on a later 
    occasion. When the bow door was inspected, cracks were found in the hinge 
    attachment welds. The attachment plate was also partly cracked. According 
    to the Shipinspec investigation report the cause for the hinge failure was 
    the under-dimensioned welding seams of the hinge attachments which led to 
    crack propagation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(f) Certain other 
    accidents to ro-ro vessels <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The accident 
    on 16 March 1987 involving the HARALD OF FREE ENTERPRISE led the Shipinspec 
    immediately to carry out a review of all Swedish flag ferries from the stability 
    point of view. Letters were also written to the owners with questions about 
    such matters as their routines for operation and checking of bow and stern 
    doors.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During this 
    investigation details were also obtained of previous bow door damage to Finnish 
    car/passenger ferries. For example, it was stated that the Finnish vessel 
    FINLANDIA sustained damage to her bow door in 1981 which also led to a modification 
    of her sister ship SILVIA REGINA, later STENA SAGA. It was also revealed that 
    the Finnish car-passenger ferry MARIELLA suffered very severe visor damage 
    in 1986 - see also further in this chapter - which led to structural changes 
    of her and the visor of her sister ship OLYMPIA, then still under construction. 
    During the investigation of the above events it turned out that the bows were 
    designed with too much flare, which had resulted in extreme bow stresses. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a result of the 
    disaster involving the ESTONIA, one of the actions taken in autumn 1994 was 
    a specific inspection of passenger ferry bow visors by the Gothenburg Shipinspec 
    office. Of the twelve ships examined within the Gothenburg area, eleven showed 
    deficiencies. These ranged from the formation of cracks in the locking devices 
    to operating system deficiencies. One vessel, the LION PRINCE, was not permitted 
    to sail, while heavy weather restrictions were imposed on certain other vessels.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Finally, the following 
    should be noted in this context. The mass media reported that the ESTONIA's 
    sister ship, DIANA II, nearly lost her bow visor between Trelleborg and Rostock 
    on the same stormy night in January 1993 when the Polish ferry JAN HEWELIUSZ 
    sank. However, no so-called Section 70 report was submitted to the Department's 
    Investigation Section as required by the existing regulations. Nor was this 
    event, as far as it is known, brought to the attention of the central authority 
    in any other way until after the loss of the ESTONA. The Department subsequently 
    submitted the question of the master's conduct for possible prosecution, but 
    the prosecutor decided not to bring an action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The DIANA II as well 
    as the also above-mentioned MARIELLA incident shall be explained in more detail 
    later on in this chapter. Before, however, the reaction of the administration 
    on the SAGA STAR accident shall be outlined as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After survey the 
    chief inspector of the Malmö Shipinspec office, Åke Sjöblom, decided on 17 
    May 1982 that SAGA STAR could sail without the bow visor until the end of 
    May, provided that the weather was good, that the voyages were undertaken 
    at reduced speed, that due attention was paid to the other factors which might 
    affect the seaworthiness of the vessel and that the log extracts were submitted 
    to the Shipinspec after each voyage.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further 
    decided that complete drawings, together with calculation material for "bow 
    door", hinges and hydraulic arrangements should immediately be submitted to 
    the Shipinspec. Following a survey on 17 May 1982 Lloyd's Register of Shipping 
    awarded an Interim Classification Certificate in accordance with the Shipinspec's 
    decision. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The new bow visor 
    was surveyed and approved on 14 June 1982.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Classification 
    Society submitted the requested calculation material, and the then Safety 
    Section of Sjöfartsverket drew up its own highly comprehensive memorandum 
    with computation sheets. This memoran-dum is dated 14 July 1982 and was intended 
    to form the basis of discussions at a safety meeting. The memorandum proposed 
    that the Administration should determine how various forces are to be calculated. 
    There are also references to the accidents referred to above, and the fact 
    that these led to changes in the rules of the Classification Societies. It 
    was alleged also that the calculations submitted by the Societies indicated 
    inadequate engineering input on the calculation and design side, and it was 
    alleged that the Classification Societies did not monitor this aspect sufficiently. 
    It was mentioned for example that the bow doors of the VISBY and a vessel 
    named WASA STAR subsequently had to be strengthened. The author of the memorandum 
    expressed a desire for further Classification Society and yard calculation 
    material, and proposed that the Administration should take measures to prevent 
    further accidents of the kind in question. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    file the matter was finalised by the then acting Sea Safety Direction of Sjöfartsverket 
    who wrote to Lloyd's Register of Shipping on 21 September 1982, criticising 
    the Society's calculations and superinten-dence. The letter concludes as follows: 
    "The Administration requests that you test the suggestions made regarding 
    the present version and indicate the reinforcements that you consider necessary. 
    In view of the fact that the locking devices of bow visors broke open in bad 
    weather on a number of vessels, the Administration further requests you to 
    account for the dimensioning of the locking devices of this vessel." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently the SAGA 
    STAR accident had triggered off even more activities within the Administration 
    as reflected in the letter that the then Safety Director, Per Eriksson, wrote 
    on 15.03.84 to Lorenzo Spinelli of the Italian Classification Society RINA 
    - see Enclosure 33.419. It reveals that the strength expert, Gunnar Hjertstedt, 
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) had written a memo 
    after the cause investigation following the SAGA STAR accident and after the 
    subsequent discussions with Lloyd's Register, of which page 1 is available 
    and where among other things it is stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The correspondence 
      and discussions with the classification society involved in this problem 
      have shown that they consider the opening and closing arrangement of doors 
      as lifting appliances exempted from their surveys, except on special request 
      of the owner, while the other scantlings of the door and the locking arrangement 
      are subject to their control. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To 
      this procedure the Swedish Administration of Shipping and Navigation (Note: 
      Sjöfartsverket) has the following objection. Details involved in the opening 
      and closing of bows are integrated parts of the doors, which we find difficult 
      to separate from the regulations concerning securing and the problem to 
      calculate and establish the scantlings of other details of the door. If 
      the control in this case is separated to different authorities the hazard 
      of missing important control objects is great, which has been demonstrated 
      in this case. The Administration of Shipping and Navigation would suggest 
      that this problem is discussed within IACS.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The memo had apparently 
    been written sometime in 1982, but in March 1984 the responsible safety director 
    was obviously not even certain whether he had passed it on to "dear Lorenzo" 
    when being reminded by his strength expert before his retirement, which is 
    another demonstration of the attitude of the responsible authorities in those 
    years. The only page available of this memo is attached together with another 
    page from another letter or memo signed by Gunnar Hjertstedt but without date 
    referring to the "closing and securing of doors" as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.420.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    33.420.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After each of the 
    above-mentioned accidents exclusively concerning bow doors of car/passenger 
    ferries or Ro-Ro cargo vessels which were only 1 year or less old - with the 
    exception of the SVEA STAR having been 8 years old - Shipinspec and/or Sjöfartsverket 
    only investigated against the Classification Societies, mainly Lloyd's Register 
    but also Bureau Veritas and Norske Veritas. The Building Yards are not even 
    mentioned and the Classification Societies were blamed for took weak construction 
    and/or under-dimensioned locking devices and hinges. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is, of course, 
    remarkable to note bearing in mind that the head of the Investigation Section 
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfarts-verket) attended all the 
    meetings of the JAIC investigating the ESTONIA casualty, be it the official 
    full Commission meetings or the internal meetings of the Swedish part of the 
    JAIC where it had obviously been decided already shortly after the catastrophe 
    to put most of the blame on the Building Yard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally the report 
    of the Gothenburg office of the Shipinspec concerning the STENA SAILER accident 
    shall be quoted as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 2 May 1974, 
      a report was received from the Gothenburg Shipinspec office of a meeting 
      dealing with examination of bow door locking devices. From this report it 
      emerged that STENA SAILER's bow door had come open during a previous voyage. 
      It also appeared that the bow door of STENA SAILER's sister ship, the UNION 
      WELLINGTON under the New Zealand flag, despite having been reinforced, had 
      been opened during heavy weather. Another sister ship, the SEA TRADER, had 
      crossed the Atlantic in bad weather, but on this vessel the bow door had 
      been welded closed. The following may also be found in the report. "During 
      the meeting, it emerged that very little is known about the forces that 
      affect the bow door. However, through the trials conducted by G.L. (Note: 
      by Germanischer Lloyd), some slight under-standing of this has been gained. 
      It appeared that more or less all the locking devices on existing vessels 
      with bow doors are of too weak construction. That matters have gone as well 
      as they have so far is due to the fact that vessels with bow doors are mostly 
      used in restricted trades where they do not normally meet such heavy weather. 
      I propose that the Administration investigates how locking devices on bow 
      doors ought to be placed, designed and constructed, and that there should 
      then be a check on the locking devices of existing vessels. This presumably 
      will not be done by the Classification Societies, since after all these 
      have already approved the existing locking devices."«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Special 
    attention has to be drawn to the obvious fact that this proposal was made 
    already in May 1974 by the chief inspector of the Gothenburg office to the 
    National Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report of Magnus 
    Sjöberg on the STENA SAILER continues: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On 8 May 1974, 
      the Department wrote to Bureau Veritas, with which STENA SAILER was classified, 
      and sent the society the same memorandum and questions as had formerly been 
      submitted to Lloyd's Register of Shipping in connection with VISBY and SVEA 
      STAR. Bureau Veritas was given the chance to respond to the questions in 
      the memorandum and to give its views on the accident in question. It was 
      then asked what maritime safety measures Bureau Veritas intended to undertake 
      in connection with the bow door accidents that had happened.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Bureau

    on 10.01.95 where it is stated among other things: <i>»The bow door drawings 
    of the MV ESTONIA were reviewed by the Hamburg local office of Bureau Veritas

    into the performance of this organisation which, after all, had issued wrong 
    "Passenger Ship Safety Certificates" for VIKING SALLY, SILJA STAR, WASA KING 
    - the three previous names of the ESTONIA while trading under the Finnish 
    flag. It is also unknown whether a similar investigation was carried out in

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    in the course of the investigation by this 'Group of Experts' some further 
    bow door incidents concerning car/passenger ferries in the Baltic have come

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>VIKING SAGA</b>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Built for AB 
    Sally - simultaneously with VIKING SALLY - at the Turku Shipyard in 1980. 
    On 20.10.84 the vessel was on her scheduled voyage from Helsinki to Stockholm 
    and encountered a south-westerly wind of 14 m/s, i.e. Bft. 6-7, when at around 
    23.00 hours she was shaken hard by the sea, coming from ca. 3 point on port 
    side. The alarm of the locking device system was not activated. In Stockholm, 
    however, heavy structural damages in way of the port visor side were found 
    and temporary repairs were carried out. During the permanent repairs, performed 
    later, it was recommended to reinforce the visor. For particulars see the 
    survey reports attached in original and in office translation as Enclosure 
    33.421. Classification Society: Det norske Veritas (DnV).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>MARIELLA <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Built for 
    Rederi AB Slite at Turku Shipyard and delivered in March 1985. On 07.11.85 
    the ferry was on her scheduled voyage from Helsinki to Stockholm, when at 
    around 23.00 hours she was hit in the front by an uncommonly high sea from 
    port which shook the vessel hard. Locking devices and hinges of the visor 
    broke, the visor was lifted up and remained connected to the ship only by 
    the visor actuators. Due to the enormous pressure, exerted on the pistons 
    during thrusting up the visor, the pistons were widened and the pressure lessened. 
    As a result thereof the visor came down again and the ingress of a large quantity 
    of water onto the car deck was only prevented by the immediately initiated 
    full-astern manoeuvre. The ship continued to Stockholm on very slow speed. 
    The Classification Society of MARIELLA was and is Det norske Veritas. At the 
    time of this incident the vessel was still under guarantee. It was considered 
    to exchange the heavily damaged visor with the identical visor of her sister 
    ship OLYMPIA which was still under construction at the Turku Shipyard, but 
    it was subsequently decided to repair and convert the visor on site while 
    the ferry kept trading and during which time the loading/discharging operations 
    were carried out exclusively via the stern ramps. The repairs, which also 
    included the locking devices being considerably reinforced, required about 
    5 months.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This incident, 
    which was probably the most serious visor damage of a car/passenger ferry 
    in the Baltic area before the ESTONIA catastrophe, led to considerable discussions 
    in the shipping industry. The fact that DnV participated in the inspections/meetings 
    with three Finnish representa-tives and one Swedish representative underlines 
    that the problems were realized and that it was clearly considered to be a 
    Class matter, the F.B.N. was not involved. After analysing the events it was 
    agreed that the immediate reduction of the speed and the turning of the stern 
    into the sea had finally prevented the loss of the visor and the subsequent 
    probably unavoidable catastrophe. - See the Inspection Report <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.422.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    visor. In addition to this the vessel is equipped with a 2.50 m high and moveable 
    collision bulkhead on the car deck.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence 
    of the MARIELLA accident the locking devices for the bow visor of her sister 
    ship OLYMPIA, delivered in April 1986, were totally changed upon the instructions 
    of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - inspector Lennart Ahlberg. The owner, Gustav 
    Myrsten, was reportedly personally handling the changes and reinforcements 
    of the locking devices. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently 
    the OLYMPIA was chartered by P&O and used in liner service between Southampton 
    and Bilbao. At the same time the Classification Society was changed from DnV 
    to Bureau Veritas (B.V.) and P&O ordered the installation of eight additional 
    locking devices in view of the regular crossing of the Bay of Biscay.</font></p>

    II <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Built for 
    SF-Line, the third Viking Line partner, in 1973 as TURELLA by Sietas Werft, 
    Hamburg. She is a passenger/Ro-Ro cargo/ferry of 7984 gross tons and 1325 
    dwt, built to Lloyd's Register Class Rules and supervision and is classed 
    + 100 A1, Ice Class I, Ice Class IA, which corresponds to Finnish/Swedish 
    Ice Class Rules 1971. The vessel is fitted with a bow visor and ramp for vehicle 
    access at the forward end. At the aft end there is a stern door/ramp. The 
    mean draught is 5.35 m, while ESTONIA's draught was about 5.5 m. Information 
    was received from Helsinki about damage to the visor of this ferry having 
    been in bare-boat charter for Tallink (ESCO) from September 1993 to May 1994 
    between Helsinki and Tallinn. During this time the ferry experienced the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 11 January 
      1994 </b>- The bow visor was frozen in position above and below the Atlantic 
      lock, which was the modification fitted in 1982 consisting of a hydraulic 
      locking arrangement between the forepeak tank top below the bow ramp position 
      and the bottom of the visor. The visor could not be opened in Tallinn and 
      the vessel was discharged by the stern. The visor's lower area was heated 
      with steam hoses to clear the ice and then released. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- on 18 February 
      1994</b> - The starboard side bow plating, below the visor and in way of 
      the Atlantic lock space, was found to be heavily set in and the visor could 
      not be opened. After discharge of vehicles, on the early morning, the vessel 
      went to the Baltic Shipyard, where repairs were effected to the starboard 
      bow. See the attached photo documentation. After this incident on 18 February, 
      extreme care was taken when navigating in ice conditions, with the vessel 
      being trimmed by the stern to keep the visor higher above the waterline.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 29 March 
      1994</b> - The bow visor was found to be jammed and upon examination it 
      was noted that the port side bow shell plating, in way of the Atlantic lock 
      position, had been heavily set in, similar in nature to the damage noted 
      on the starboard side on 18 February 1994. Immediate temporary repairs were 
      carried out to allow the vessel to continue her service. On 4 April 1994 
      it became necessary to carry out some additional welding to the temporary 
      repair on the port side. Upon subsequent dry-docking it was found that extensive 
      damage to the shell plating on both sides had been sustained whilst the 
      bow visor was damaged as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Bow lower edge 
      plating, port and starboard buckled and set in and visor void tank possibly 
      breached.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the course of 
    the year 1995 and subsequently this 'Group of Experts' initiated a number 
    of technical and scientific investigations to ascertain the load exposure 
    of the visor and its locking devices, the actual strength of the Atlantic 
    Lock and the condition of parts recovered from wreck and visor. Also the break 
    load of the bow ramp hinges and the forces necessary for the visor lugs to 
    cut through the deck beam at frame 159 were calculated. In addition the available 
    video footage was evaluated and analysed and the videos still showing unexplainable 
    damage to the wreck were examined by a diving and explosive expert. Furthermore 
    the investigation results of "The Independent Fact Group", Stockholm, concerning 
    the forgery of documents to hide the initial unseaworthi-ness of the ESTONIA 
    have been taken up into this chapter with the permission of the authors. Finally, 
    the results of an investigation by the Det Norske Veritas Classification A/S 
    Håvik/Norway concerning the design load aspects for the bow area of Ro-Ro 
    vessels under the heading<b><i> "Bow Impact of Ro-Ro Vessels"</i></b> have 
    been made available and shall be considered in this chapter as well. <br>

    of the Government.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is the purpose

    departure by The Swedish inspectors Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée from the 
    Shipinspec Malmö office. The inspection was meant to be a Port State Control 
    (PSC) to train 8 or 9 high ranking Estonian officials. - See Chapter 15. At 
    the end the normal PSC form used by Shipinspec inspectors in Swedish ports 
    was filled out and the "findings" entered. Both form and findings do exist 
    in at least 4, probably 5, different versions, all of which are discussed 
    and evaluated by the IFG, the apparent purpose being to hide in hindsight 
    the initial unseaworthiness of the ESTONIA upon departure from Tallinn which 
    would clearly have been established if the complete findings would have been

    Structural Analysis of Bow Visor and Locking Devices<br>
    by means of the Finite Element Analysis by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As part of the investigation 
    in connection with the sinking of the ferry ESTONIA the structure of the visor 
    has been calculated on the basis of the load requirements by the Classification 
    Society Bureau Veritas (B.V.) by means of the Finite Element Method. Thereby 
    the distribution of the reaction forces on the fixing points of the visor, 
    and especially on the Atlantic lock, were of particular interest because of 
    the allegations published by the JAIC that the casualty had been initiated 
    by the failure of the locking devices of the visor. For this reason detailed 
    calculations have been performed, including cases whereby only a limited attachment 
    still existed after the hinges had failed. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time 
    of the design and construction of the vessel in 1979/1980 such detailed calculations 
    were neither required by the Classification Societies nor were they state-of-the-art. 
    The selected load on the model is based on an analysis of B.V. whereby the 
    load, acting normally on the shell plating of the visor was assumed to be 
    the water pressure acting on the visor when the ferry was underway. The load 
    acting on the lowest part of the visor was assumed to be 7 t/m² and decreasing 
    continuously with increasing height. At no height level is the pressure less 
    than 3.5 t/m². The load includes the C-deck (forecastle deck). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The weight 
    of the empty visor and the rubber packings on the forepeak deck have been 
    taken into account in all calculations. Wave loads have been assumed to act 
    only on the port side of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Before discussing 
    the results, the symbols for the directions into which the forces were acting 
    shall be explained:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> x = transverse 
      (athwartship)<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">y = longitudinal 
      (forward aft)<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">z = vertical 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The calculations 
    clearly reveal that as long as the hinges are intact the Atlantic lock takes 
    only very little load. The force direction is opposite to the direction into 
    which the vessel is proceeding, i.e. aft. The small load is to be attributed 
    to the low stiffeners and the high deformation of the visor bottom. Even by 
    using a more detailed net of finite elements no other tendencies became apparent 
    respectively no other results were achieved. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In normal cases 
    the highest loads appear in way of the side locks. The loads cause the aft 
    bulkheads of the visor to be pressed against the front bulkheads of the vessel 
    in the middle and upper areas.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case also 
    the rubber packing of the visor on the vessel's front bulkheads are taken 
    into account the vertically acting loads are reduced.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If a load is 
    acting on the visor only from one side the hinge on this side has to bear 
    excessive load while the load on the other is less than normal, however, partly 
    acting from different directions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    visor is under constant pressure the loads on the hinges and side locks do 
    increase while the load on the Atlantic lock is decreasing. In case one or 
    both hinges fail all other fixing points have to bear substantially more load 
    and the force direction on the Atlantic lock changes to the opposite direction, 
    i.e. to forward. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case one 
    hinge fails the Atlantic lock has to bear 2.6 times of the normal load, if 
    both hinges fail the Atlantic lock has to bear 15.8 times of the normal load. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results 
    of this structural analysis of the visor can be summarised as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By means of several 
    calculation models various load conditions have been simulated, for example 
    the pressure load according to B.V., the load from the side and the load due 
    to a permanent pressure load. In all cases the visor's own weight was taken 
    into account.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The different 
    fixing point conditions were simulated as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - visor fixed 
      to hinges and locking devices,<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally 
      the rubber packings were considered,<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally 
      considering the manual side locks, <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- failure 
      of one and both hinges. The analysis reveals that the Atlantic lock absorbs 
      only a small force component as long as the hinges are intact. The force 
      direction is aft.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The highest forces 
    on the fixing points are effective when the load is acting simultaneously 
    on both side locks. If the visor is exposed to a load only on one side, the 
    load on the hinges on this side is the biggest.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case that 
    one or both hinges fail, the Atlantic lock becomes exposed to very heavy loads 
    and the force direction changes by 180° to forward.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If both hinges 
    fail the Atlantic lock has to take the heaviest load. The complete Report 
    is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.2.430.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In Estonia such an organisation 
    did not exist, but already early in the morning of the casualty day President 
    Lennart Meri had decided that in Estonia an independent commission should 
    be formed "to investigate the circumstances having led to the casualty and 
    the government organisations". (The Andi Meister book: "The Unfinished Logbook".) 
    This commission should consist of 11 members, mainly ministers and their representatives. 
    Chairman to be was the Minister for Transport and Communication, Andi Meister, 
    an engineer by profession. Captain Uno Laur, up to 1992 head of the navigation 
    department of ESCO and now a maritime consultant, was appointed by the President 
    to be his personal representative. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Prime Minister Maart Laar returned to 
    Tallinn that same evening and reported about the decision to form a joint 
    commission, five names from the above-mentioned 11 member commission were 
    selected and the embassies of Sweden and Finland were informed accordingly. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the same evening the Swedish JAIC members 
    together with the Swedish observer, Captain Sten Andersson from Sjöfartsverket, 
    flew over to Turku and met the Finnish members who had been on site since 
    the morning already and the first discussions between these two groups took 
    place.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the following morning, 29 September, the Swedish 
    and Finnish JAIC members met again and, after some further discussions, decided 
    to invite the Estonians to come over the for first joint meeting straight 
    away, which they did. By means of the Estonian Coast Guard plane the following

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently the three crew members considered 
    to be key witnesses were heard by the joint JAIC. See Subchapter 37.1.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the first meeting of the JAIC, also the 
    head of the Navigation Department of ESCO and Safety Adviser of Estline, Captain 
    Enn Neidre, was present, which apparently was considered to be normal procedure, 
    viz. that the manager responsible for officers and crew inside the organisation 
    of a shipping company is on-site when the survivors come ashore in order to 
    talk to them and prepare them to give evidence to the police subsequently, 
    that is to say, <i>"to remind them of their loyalty to their company"</i>. 
    That was actually done by Enn Neidre but he also attended the subsequent hearings 
    of the key witnesses Silver Linde, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak by the police 
    and the meanwhile formed JAIC. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The so-called key witnesses and other uninjured 
    crew members who returned to Tallinn on the evening of 29 September 1994 had 
    already been interrogated in Turku. Some of them, considered to be able to 
    give important evidence, up to three times, i.e. by the Finnish, Swedish and 
    Estonian police respectively security police. Upon arrival at the Tallinn 
    airport in the evening they were again interrogated by the Estonian criminal 
    and security police. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently it became obvious to the Estonians 
    in the course of the following days what really had gone wrong with the ESTONIA 
    and what it would mean for the reputation of the young state of Estonia if 
    the evidence given by some surviving crew members about the real causes for 
    the catastrophe would get to the public. It was thus decided to have somebody 
    with authority inside the JAIC, who was respected and feared by the crew and 
    who would - just by his presence - remind them of their "loyalty obligation" 
    to ESCO. This was Captain Enn Neidre, the head of the Navigation Department 
    of ESCO and safety adviser for Estline.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although in an <i>"Immediate Press Release"</i> 
    by the Foreign Ministry of Estonia on 10.10.94 at 17.00 hours - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/35.1.441.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    a bit longer, but as from 22.08.95 Jukka Häkämies attended all Commission

    the Finnish Board of Navigation. Consequently all three National Maritime 
    Administrations, having been responsible for the proper certification and 
    compliance of the ferry with SOLAS and other safety conventions were represented 
    at all the meetings of the JAIC, where among other things the failures and

    The Documentation </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The Swedish and Finnish parts 
    of the JAIC were obliged by law to keep a register - logbook (<i>dagbok</i>), 
    into which the complete incoming and outgoing documentation had to be registered 
    day-by-day. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unknown what Estonian law requires in 
    this respect and how it was complied with by the Estonian part of the JAIC. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sweden a very detailed and accurate looking 
    logbook system was kept from the very beginning, although it does not contain 
    the complete documentation. In Finland apparently no system whatsoever does 
    exist. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swedish documentation is contained in 9 
    files A - J, as far as it is known, in which the documents were registered 
    with running numbers, in total more than 1000. The complete register is available 
    to this 'Group of Experts', but not attached to this report. While working 
    papers and other documents considered to be crucial for the investigation 
    were kept <i>"classified"</i> until the Final Report was published, most of 
    the documentation collected by the Swedish part of the JAIC as time went by 
    was open to the public although this was realised by very few people only. 
    After the publication of the Final Report everything should have been made 
    public according to applicable regulations. They were however not complied 
    with as certain documents known to have been in the possession of a member 
    of the JAIC cannot be traced in the files nor are they registered. This refers 
    especially to the repair lists from on board of ESTONIA in which the crew 
    was - among other things - asking for repair of the broken port outer hinge 
    of the bow ramp. According to Börje Stenström these lists have been in his 
    possession. </font></p>

    Governments of the three countries involved, their various administrations 
    and other organisations took place during the early days and following weeks 
    with regard to the sinking of the ESTONIA and which were of relevance to the 
    investigations of the JAIC. Some shall be explained below. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>36.1<br>
    Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée</b></font></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On the day after the casualty, 
    29 September 1994, Chief Inspector Åke Sjöblom and Inspector Gunnar Zahlée 
    returned from Tallinn to Sweden with their knowledge of the extremely bad 
    condition of visor and bow ramp, the incompetence of the crew and finally 
    the impossibility to stop the ferry from departing despite all their endeavours. 
    See Chapter 15. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already on the following day a confidential 
    meeting behind closed doors took place which was chaired by the then head 
    of Sjöfartsinspektionen, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, with the heads of the Stockholm 
    and Gothenburg offices of Sjöfartsinspektionen and their assistants attending. 
    Åke Sjöblom informed those assembled about his real findings and his desperate 
    but futile attempts to stop the ferry from departing. The very far reaching 
    consequences were discussed, but then it was decided to inform the public 
    that only minor deficiencies had been found, moreover that the inspection 
    had only been on-the-job training and not a real PSC. See <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    15</a>. This official version is upheld by Sjöfartsverket up to day and Åke 
    Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée have confirmed it when being questioned by police 
    and the public prosecutor. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unknown whether the members of 
    the Swedish part of the JAIC were informed during a meeting in the Sjöfartsverket 
    head office in Norrköping on 13 October 1994. It has to be assumed that Olof 
    Forssberg and Börje Stenström were informed, because otherwise it would not 
    be understandable that Börje Stenström in his capacity as chief maritime technical 
    investigator did not take part in the questioning of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar 
    Zahlée at the office of the Swedish JAIC in November 1994, which was, at least 
    officially, the only time that these two - being really key witnesses as to 
    the ferry's condition before her last departure - have been interrogated by 
    JAIC members. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Åke Sjöblom at the beginning wrote a 
    draft version of his report con-cerning the "On-the-job training on the Estonia" 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.198.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.198</a> - and did send this draft by letter of 24 October 1994 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.199.htm" target="_blank">see 
    Enclosure 15.199</a> - to Willand Ringborg being in charge of the Sjöfartsverket 
    project of the training of Estonian safety inspectors. Recently another copy 
    of this letter with two hand-written notes to Börje Stenström on it was made 
    available - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.1.443.htm" target="_blank">see

      of Åke Sjöblom.)<br>
      The 2nd note at the bottom in another handwriting reads: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If she would have been stopped on the 
      27th to correct all the 17, they would probably quite quickly have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found 
      the rest of the damages (failures) and in that case the ship would have 
      been detained for a few weeks in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estonia.

    version of this "filled-in PSC form" is attached as Supplement 223 together

      assistance of the Swedish Maritime Administration inspectors) on m.v. 'Estonia' 
      on 27.09.94. The purpose of this inspection was to obtain experience for 
      the Estonian inspectors in respect of large passenger ships and also to 
      carry out a Port State Control (PSC) of this vessel. As a result of this 
      inspection all shortcomings noted by the inspectors and instructors were 
      fixed in the "Report of Inspection in Accordance with the Memorandum of 
      Understanding on Port State Control". This Report was signed by the Head 
      of National Ship Inspection Department A.Valgma. Later on this Report was 
      used as a teaching aid on training of inspectors. The aim of this inspection 
      was not to find out the knowledge and training of the officers or crew members 
      because it is the task of other authorities. In course of discussings with 
      the ship's officers the theoretical problems of stability were not touched 
      since the inspectors were interested in technical condition and organizational 
      level of the vessel. <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The described manipulation of the documentation 
      was a vain attempt to disguise the personal tragedy of the two Swedes who 
      had on this occasion completely failed in their professional mission. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the E.N.M.B. in the trainee 
      team - in particular Aarne Valgma - had the authority to detain the vessel 
      until repairs had been effected (see Chapter 15), whether this inspection 
      qualified as a Port State Control inspection or not <a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank">(see 
      Chapters 9.3.</a>, 15). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two Swedes had no such authority and 
      those who had in Sweden and were contacted by Sjöblom (see Chapter 15) did 
      not live up to their professional duties. The reason may be the notorious 
      lack of fantasy in bureaucrats. All they would have to do is to communicate 
      to the Estonian authorities that the vessel would not be permitted to enter 
      Swedish waters or ports in this condition. In the JAIC Report, Chapter 5.2, 
      only the following is mentioned: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"During the last day 
        in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme for Estonian Maritime 
        Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port State Control in 
        compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control 
        (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough Port State 
        Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed by 
        <b>two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. </b>The 
        exercise was documented in protocol, set up in a form according to the 
        Paris MOU. A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement. The 
        Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by the 
        Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and very 
        well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused detention 
        or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular Port State 
        Control. However, some deficiencies were noted, such as that the rubber 
        seals for the bow visor were worn, had tear marks in some places, and 
        were in need of replacement, and watertight hatch covers on the car deck 
        were open and in a condition indicating that at least one was not normally 
        closed. It was also stated during the interrogation that the Swedish inspectors 
        had experienced <b>"lack of respect for issues related to load line matters"</b> 
        in their contact with officers met during the exercise." </i> </font></p>

        the bomb threats and presumably reported them to the intermediate Estonian 
        Commission. Both left this commission upon their own recommendation shortly 
        after its foundation. </font></li>

        in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i> on page 21 among other things 
        after the wreck had been found: <i>"On the recordings of the search vessel 
        the front side of the vessel was flat and then for the first time the 
        idea came up that the waves had torn off the visor and that water had 
        penetrated the car deck via the bow ramp which was also confirmed by survivors. 
        Another possibility seemed not to exist. <b>On the other hand, a bomb 
        could also not be fully excluded." </b></i></font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The watch A.B. onboard 
        of the training vessel "LINDA", having been berthed in Tallinn on the 
        evening of 27 September 1994, told SPIEGEL TV in December 1999 that he 
        had overheard a VHF conversation between the ESTONIA and "Port Control", 
        i.e. the Harbour Master's office. "Port Control" had asked the ESTONIA 
        either shortly before or after the departure whether the search for bombs 
        had brought any result. ESTONIA's answer was: No. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Bomb threats against 
        a ferry carrying on each voyage 1000 people or more onboard is with certainty 
        a matter to be reported to the Board of Directors. It has to be assumed 
        therefore that Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Director of N&T - see 
        Subchapter 5.2 - and member of the Board of Estline was informed. It is 
        most likely that he - in turn - informed the N&T management because at 
        about the same time there were bomb threats against Silja vessels, which 
        were considered to be so serious that drastic safety measures were introduced 
        at the Silja pier in Stockholm. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It was confirmed by 
        Sjöfartsinspect's inspector Lennart Ahlberg to SPIEGEL TV in December 
        1999 that the Estonian as well as the Swedish criminal police and also 
        Sjöfartsverket were informed about these bomb threats.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In summary of the aforementioned 
        it has to be concluded that relevant governmental agencies of Estonia 
        and Sweden, and probably also Finland, especially their police organisations 
        were aware that there had been recent threats to sink ESTONIA by bomb 
        explosions and that the last threat dated 27 September, when the ferry 
        had been searched but apparently without result. It has to be assumed 
        that the JAIC members had the same knowledge as Olof Forssberg was a high 
        ranking civil servant with the Ministry of Defence and Kari Lethola being 
        part of the Ministry of Justice.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It is unknown to this 
        'Group of Experts' whether the government agencies mentioned before also 
        knew already on the morning of 28 September that there possibly had been 
        explosions onboard of the ESTONIA because the technical facilities available 
        to the Nordic countries and their partners to detect explosions at sea 
        are not the subject of this investigation.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> But the way in which 
        the JAIC members and the Finnish criminal police officers performed the 
        interrogations of the survivors does indicate that they had knowledge 
        of - at least - possible explosions onboard. The questioning of the German 
        survivor Manfred Rothe by the criminal police in Helsinki may serve as 
        an example. It was video-filmed and according to the transcript he was 
        asked among other things: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>"1. Mr. Rothe, could one think that the vessel was 
        hit by a mine?</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>2. ... and, no explosives at all?" </i>(See

      placed ashore in Hangö paint samples were taken from the areas around the 
      failed locking devices and the visor lug for subsequent examination for 
      possible traces of explosions. (See Subchapter 32.1.)<br>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In this connection it 
      has to be noted that the explosive experts of the Finnish criminal police 
      apparently did not know that it was no more possible to prove by means of 
      the above-mentioned methods whether an object had been affected by explosions 
      which had been below water for 7 weeks. According to the explosives expert 
      Martin Volk this is only possible by a metallurgical examination of the 
      molecular structure of the affected metal. Such an examination, however, 
      was not carried out according to available information. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of the existing rumours about "possible" 
      or even "actual" explosions in the foreship area which might also have caused 
      a hole in the starboard hull - see the following Subchapter 36.3 - with 
      respective influence on the casualty scenario, the official investigation 
      was never directed in this direction. It has to be noted, however, that 
      recent photos, taken of the visor since being in Södertälje, showed that 
      a substantial part of the visor bulkhead plating around the initial location 
      of the lugs for the side locks has been cut off at both sides. Initially 
      it had only been small rectangular parts directly around the locations of

      The "Hole in the Starboard Side"</b></font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 2/3 and 9/10 October 
      1994 ROV inspections of the wreck were carried out in the presence of Tuomo 
      Karppinen of the Finnish JAIC. The hole in the forward part of the starboard 
      hull seems to have been discovered which assumption is confirmed by the 
      many cuts of the video footage of this area. The existence of this hole 
      seems to have been known also to Sten Andersson, thus at a certain level 
      within Sjöfartsverket, as well as to the JAIC members. This fact was consequently 
      leaked out to the press, as is first shown in the article on 18 October 
      1994 in DAGENS NYHETER by Anders Hellberg, where he states: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">"Bow Visor Tore Up Holes 
        <br>
        Accident Commission convinced what caused the Estonia casualty. Estonia's 
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together 
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull caused water 
        to flow on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the 
        ship completely changed. <br>
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces 
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, 
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the JAIC who was not present at the Monday 
        session in Tallinn.<br>
        Also from other very well informed sources <b>DN has received the same 
        information, that holes in the hull contributed to water getting into 
        the ship so quickly</b>. According to Sten Andersson, the three visor 
        locks, two on the sides and one at the bottom, were ripped off. This can 
        be seen from the new underwater pictures taken. <br>
        The DN's source, with substantial knowledge of the ship's construc-tion, 
        has difficulties believing that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic 
        lock - could have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. The source 
        said: "I rather believe that the visor attachments on the deck have broken 
        and that the 54.5 ton visor fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock. 
        The bow visor then started to move forward/ aft tearing on the upper part 
        of the ramp on which cars and trailers normally drive. The bow ramp hung 
        on the visor and was finally dragged out a meter or two in its upper part. 
        Here water came into car deck."<br>
        <b>Note: </b>This should be the other way round: The visor actually hung 
        on the bow ramp, but it may be a misunderstanding. <br>
        But many experts have had difficulties to believe that this compara-tively 
        small opening of the ramp would have let in such huge amounts of water, 
        that later sank the ship. More than 1000 tonnes have entered.<br>
        The two pieces of information explain how additional water came into the 
        ship. When the visor finally broke loose the hydraulic actuators, that 
        normally regulate the opening, tore big holes into the hull. The beam 
        on which the actuator was fastened has, in its turn, <b>ripped off part 
        of the hull plating. There are pictures of those damages, that we just 
        got from the new videos taken by the underwater cameras, Sten Andersson 
        says. </b><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Such pictures are not visible on the video footage publicly 
        available.<br>
        According to the source of DN this scenario gives "violent mechanical 
        damages and big holes in the hull". Those holes will then be situated 
        under the water line in the heavy sea. <br>
        Survivors have testified about several different bangs, that might explain 
        how the bow visor first came loose in its lockings from the actuator attachments. 
        <br>
        Those who stayed in the cabins under car deck in the foremost part of 
        the ship have told about a scraping from the outside of the bottom, that 
        is the outside of the ship. That sound might have been caused by the finally 
        ripped-off visor drifting along the ship's side. The new conclusions of 
        the JAIC changes the earlier picture, where the visor was ripped off and 
        the bow port was instead pushed in by the violent sea. <br>
        The question then is of course whether the crew had any possibility to 
        save the ship and alert the passengers. <b>Probably the entire course 
        of events - with the bow visor coming loose, the pushed-out bow ramp, 
        and the ripped-up side of the hull </b>- took place very quickly. The 
        officers on the bridge didn't have many minutes until so much water had 
        entered, that the ship was not possible to save. <br>
        Why, then, has not the bow visor been found in the proximity of the wreck? 
        The Finnish Coast Guard has been looking along the route close to Estonia, 
        but hasn't found anything.<b> The Commission is convinced that the visor 
        doesn't lie in the area close to the wreck</b>, where one has been looking. 
        A possibility is, that it all happened so fast that the visor simply lies 
        under the wreck and therefore will not be found until the wreck - possibly 
        - will be salvaged."</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Note:</b> Hellberg 
          obviously means damage to the ship's hull not caused by the actuators 
          when cutting through the front bulkheads and Sten Andersson's reply 
          indicates that he refers to damage by which massive water ingress on 
          to the car deck is possible. Hellberg has just a vague idea but confronts 
          Andersson with information about big damage to the hull's side. If Andersson 
          had not been aware about such damage he would have corrected Hellberg 
          imme-diately. But Andersson did not reject it and let it pass. Thus 
          it was published and stands up to day uncorrected. Hellberg furthermore 
          writes in his article that "the scraping noises heard by survivors from 
          the 1st deck might have been caused by the visor drifting along the 
          vessel's hull side" which became indeed part of the JAIC scenario. This 
          cannot have been possible because according to the <i>"Floatability 
          Calculations of the Visor"</i> by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg, 
          the visor sank as soon as it became detached from the vessel - <a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank">see 
          Subchapter 34.11 </a>- which was only when the vessel was heeling from 
          90° to upside down, i.e. approximately when the heel was 130°/140° - 
          <a href="chapter31.htm" target="_blank">see Chapter 31</a> - the Casualty 
          Scenario. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Although such a hole 
        could have explained the sinking and, in particular, the way the ferry 
        sank, it was completely ignored by the JAIC in their press conference 
        and in all internal and external publications. However, not all of the 
        relatives forgot about the Hellberg article in DN and especially those 
        who had made own observations which could lead towards a hole in the side 
        of the ferry remained very interested and followed this up whenever possible. 
        This occurred for example at a big meeting at Karlberg Castle on 13 March 
        1996 when Johan Fransson from Sjöfartsverket was asked whether there was 
        a hole in the starboard side. His answer was: <i>"Yes there is a hole 
        in the starboard side, but I don't know anything about it - please the 
        next question!"</i> This was said in the presence of many relatives, journalists 
        and survivors, among them Rolf Sörman, who reported on the meeting at 
        the Styrelse for Psychological Försvar (Board of Psychological Defence) 
        on 9 June 1999 when the survivors Mikael Öun, Sarah Hedrenius, Sten Jolind 
        and himself met with Johan Fransson, Per Nordström from Sjöfartsverket 
        and some people from the SPF. Rolf Sörman asked Johan Fransson again whether 
        there was a hole in the starboard side and his answer was "yes": However 
        the "hole" had disappeared to the public and was completely covered by 
        the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström and his colleagues 
        which was presented to the public. </font></p>

      The Hearing of the Survivors </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Finnish police took 
      statements of all the survivors brought to Finland - sometimes two or three 
      statements - during which one of the standard questions to the survivors 
      was: <i>Did you note or feel explosions?" </i>The Swedish survivors were 
      interviewed by local policemen in their home cities or villages, who in 
      most cases were not trained to ask the proper questions for a maritime investigation. 
      This resulted in the disappearance of valuable evidence forever, a procedure 
      which as such was accepted by the Swedish part of the JAIC as well as by 
      the investigating public prosecutor. There is evidence that SÄPO (Security 
      Police) officials tried to persuade survivors to change their statements 
      in regard to particular matters. Some followed, very few did not. All the 
      statements were in the early stage declared "classified" by prosecutor Birgitta 
      Cronier, however, were declassified sometime in 1995. The statements were 
      sent to Estonia on 17 October 1994 and were received by the Swedish part 
      of the JAIC on 20 October 1994. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Estonia the crew survivors were frequently 
      heard by the Criminal Police, the Security Police and subsequently by a 
      transport investigation office in addition to being heard several times 
      by Estonian members of the JAIC. According to the statements available the 
      Estonian passenger survivors however were heard only once. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Estonian statements were sent to the 
      Swedish and Finnish police and translated subsequently into the respective 
      languages. The Swedish versions were received by the JAIC on 1 December 
      1994 and are available together with some of the Estonian originals to this 
      'Group of Experts'. A comparison of the Estonian originals with the translations 
      revealed that the Swedish text is substantially shorter and relevant parts 
      of the originals were not translated at all. It is, of course, unknown to 
      this 'Group of Experts' whether this occurred just due to sloppiness of 
      the translator or was done deliberately. The statement of Ain-Alar Juhanson 
      taken by the Central Criminal Police of Tallinn, at Tallinn airport on 29 
      September 1994 at 17.10 hours shall serve as one of many examples: <br>
      The translation from the Estonian original reads as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Before the catastrophe 
        I was on Deck 2 in cabin 1056 of the ferry 'Estonia'. The vessel left 
        her berth in Tallinn, at 19.00 hours. Our group consisted of 4 sportsmen. 
        Myself, Anti Arak, Kristjan Rainend, Jaak Pehk are athletes. Ülle Karo 
        was responsible for our massage. We were underway with a Mercedes bus 
        without driver. Our bus was one of the last taken on to the car deck. 
        I do not know how the bus was secured. The driver was K. Rainend who had 
        driven the bus on to the car deck. We had a double cabin but we were 4. 
        The cabin no. was 1056. Ülle Karo had bought a 1-person ticket for this 
        cabin. We four others had deck tickets. The cabin was in the middle of 
        the ship. I cannot define exactly, I was unable to orientate myself on 
        the vessel. At the moment of the catastrophe we were in cabin 1056. Myself, 
        Arak, Rainend and Ü. Karo. I do not know in which cabin Pehk was. We all 
        slept.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a high sea state prevailing. 
        The waves were beating against the vessel, there was strong wind. I woke 
        up by a heavy metal bang. I felt that the vessel heeled immediately to 
        the right side. I was sleeping on the floor. Prior to this metallic bang 
        I did not hear anything in particular due to the noises of the engines. 
        As a result of the bang we all woke up. It was clear to us that something 
        particularly extraordinary had occurred. I took my Texas trousers, my 
        shirt and left the cabin. All the passengers were already in the alleyway. 
        It appeared that some water was already in the alleyway. All four of us 
        then went up the stairs to the deck - I was the first one. The vessel 
        continued to heel to the right. On the stairs there were only few people, 
        but up at the doors it was quite full. There was full panic. Everybody 
        was screaming: "What shall we do?" At this time everywhere the light was 
        on and in my opinion also the engines were still running. Only very few 
        managed to reach the railing. Not everybody managed to get out of the 
        foyer. Myself, Arak and Rainend managed to reach the railing. After we 
        had reached the railing I heard a female voice shouting over the loudspeakers 
        2 or 3 times the word "Alarm" in Estonian language. At this time there 
        was still light. Arak and myself stayed for a while at the railing. There 
        was a strong storm. Suddenly the vessel heeled heavily to the right, the 
        heel reached almost 90°. Then we heard the siren and the light went out. 
        We climbed on to the side of the vessel and tried, depending on the heel 
        of the vessel, to have a firm hold beneath our feet. Together with us 
        many people had climbed on to the side of the vessel. Rainend did put 
        on a lifevest whilst holding on to the railing. There were many lifevests. 
        Together with Arak we tried to fabricate a raft from lifevests. We succeeded 
        but did not manage to lift the raft on to the vessel's side. There were 
        a number of rubber boats floating around in the waves. I cannot say when 
        the ship's engines stopped. Together with Arak we estimated that in case 
        we would jump into the water to reach one of the lifeboats we would be 
        smashed against the vessel by the waves coming in from this side. There 
        was a heavy storm. We then moved towards the bow. We could see that the 
        bow was damaged. At the bow I climbed along some sort of grids downwards 
        together with Arak. To the water's surface remained some 10 m and hand-in-hand 
        we jumped. We swam about 100 m away from the vessel to avoid being sucked 
        down by the vessel. Due to the high waves we were unable to save ourselves 
        on the rafts. We had both put on lifevests when we were standing at the 
        railing and now were swimming together until we saw a white cabinet. The 
        doors of the cabinet were closed. We climbed on top of it. I do not know 
        how long we were on the cabinet. We were able to hold ourselves to the 
        handles of the cabinet. In the moonlight we saw the vessel. The distance 
        was approximately 150 m. Finally we managed to reach a rubber boat. After 
        about 3-4 hours we were picked up by a helicopter. Together with Arak 
        I was rescued. I cannot say what happened to the others.<br>

        our bus during the catastrophe." </i></font></p>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"We were with a Mercedes 
        Benz bus. Our bus was one of the last placed onto the car deck. I do not 
        know how the bus was secured to the car deck. The bus driver was Kristjan 
        Rainend. Ülle Karo had bought the ticket for cabin 1056. The other 4 had 
        deck passenger tickets. The cabin was in the middle of the vessel, where 
        exactly I cannot say because I could not orientate myself. All 4 of us 
        slept. Out at sea there were high waves which were beating against the 
        vessel, there was strong wind. Woke up from a heavy metallic bang. Before 
        that nothing worth mentioning was heard in the engines ........ After 
        the mentioned metallic bang the vessel began to heel to the right. The 
        light was everywhere functioning when we jumped out into the alleyway. 
        I had the impression that the engines were still running. Ülle could not 
        come out of a door. Myself, Arak and Rainend reached the railing. There 
        was heavy storm, the vessel heeled ca. 90°. Suddenly there was a loud 
        siren, thereafter the light went out. There were many people up there. 
        At the railing there were also many lifevests. In the sea there were many 
        liferafts but we did not dare to jump from the side because the waves 
        would smash us back against the vessel. I do not know when the engines 
        stopped. We went to the vessel's bow which was damaged. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hand-in-hand we did jump into the water 
        which was about 10 m below. We swam about 100 m away from the vessel and 
        were holding on to a cabinet which we met. There we were about 150 m away 
        from the vessel. The moon was shining and therefore we could see the vessel. 
        Finally we reached a rubber boat. Together with Arak I managed to get 
        in. I do not know what happened to the others. I was not on the car deck 
        to check our bus during the catastrophe." </i></font></p>

        is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.5.446.2.htm" target="_blank"> 
        Enclosure 36.5.446.2. </a><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite obvious that the Swedish text 
        by far does not contain the information stated in the original, thus the 
        psychological expert to the Swedish JAIC Bengt Schager, who was to summarize 
        all statements for the other JAIC members and experts, was not in a position 
        to evaluate the full evidence of this important witness. He could therefore 
        not question him further about his observations at the damaged bow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that very important evidence 
        remained unknown to the JAIC. <br>
        In any event, the JAIC relied on the statements of the survivors mainly 
        taken by policemen untrained for maritime casualties and refrained from 
        the taking of own statements. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the JAIC only heard 
        a couple of the crew members whom they considered to be the key witnesses, 
        which they actually were and still are, however, they did not tell the 
        truth or, at least, not the full truth. They were - as it could be expected 
        - very loyal to their owners ESCO and N&T. The many passenger survivors 
        having made numerous valuable observations were not heard by the JAIC, 
        except for one or two. Instead the psychological expert to the Swedish 
        part of the JAIC, Bengt Schager, was instructed to make summaries from 
        available statements which were then handed to the other members and experts 
        and on the basis of which they formed their opinion about the developments 
        onboard and about the casualty sequence of events. These summaries were 
        complied in such a way that for example water observed on deck 1 was not 
        even mentioned in the first version. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kari Lethola was interviewed by Jutta 
        Rabe of SPIEGEL TV in May 1996 and was also confronted with certain survivor 
        statements, e.g. Carl Övberg, he stated that they (the Finnish part of 
        the JAIC) did not have the complete statements, but just "Summaries" made 
        by Bengt Schager. In the course of the further interview it turned out 
        that the JAIC had not taken the statements of any passengers themselves. 
        Nevertheless it turned out that Lethola knew the Övberg statement about 
        the hydraulic noises heard, which, according to Lethola, were caused by 
        the visor actuators when the visor was opening/closing after the locks 
        were broken.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Stenström the noises were 
        caused by the stabilisers. Lethola subsequently confirmed that the JAIC 
        did everything to prove in the best possible manner that the hypothetical 
        scenario developed by Stenström less than 4 weeks after the casualty is 
        the real one and that consequently the locking devices of the visor, allegedly 
        under-dimensioned, were the main cause of the casualty. In a subsequent 
        interview after his resignation from the JAIC Bengt Schager told Jutta 
        Rabe among other things: </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Q:</b> I was told 
        that you were first asked to make summaries of the statements and then 
        later again, more or less, to count statements which were talking about 
        a detailed time line, so that one could know when there was water under 
        the car deck, etc.? <br>
        <b>A</b>: Oh yes, when I made my first version we suddenly came across 
        that new things were important, on which I had not put any emphasis before, 
        for example, we have the reports about water on deck 1 and I knew there 
        were reports about water on deck 1 and I was again re-reading this in 
        a more thorough way and put it into my summary as it was said, because 
        it could prove to be important after the shipbuilders report. I did not 
        know, when I started my first version that this could be very important, 
        that the actual wording had to be put there. <br>
        <b>Q:</b> Did it affect in some way? <br>
        <b>A:</b> No, it was more ... I knew at that time that we believed that 
        the accident started with water on car deck. We had reports of small amounts 
        of water, trickles really, on deck no. 1, but then people came out publicly 
        and said that the accident started with water on deck 1 and then it is 
        obvious that I had to rewrite it in a way that is clear that the data 
        we have does not support such an idea. <br>
        <b>Q:</b> So, from the existing statements you did not get that impression? 
        <br>
        <b>A</b>: That's correct.<br>
        <b>Q: </b>You have not been able to talk to passengers who had seen water 
        under the car deck and asked them again?<br>
        <b>A:</b> No. " </i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Had the JAIC questioned 
        Carl Övberg and Carl-Erik Reintamm they would have become quickly aware

      1. Q: Do you know how the visor functioned?<br>
      A: Very little, not my job. <br>
      2. Q: Was it dark when you left 'Estonia'?<br>
      A: Some light in the distance. Was swimming. Saw 'Estonia's' silhouette. 
      Frightening. Heavy list. Saved himself before the capsizing. <br>
      3. Q: Was the visor in place? <br>
      A: Possibly, but not fully certain. The stern sank first. The vessel turned 
      when the stern sank down. Much shouting. Completely dark.<br>
      4. Q: Did you see the bulbous bow above water!<br>
      A: Cannot answer this (was close to being squeezed to death when rescued 
      by 'Silja Europa').<br>
      5. Q: <b>Did you see a black hole? </b><br>
      A: Impossible to see.<br>
      6. Q: Have you been on watch?<br>
      A: Yes, I was in the engine control room. Did not see anything unusual. 
      <br>
      7. Q: How did the vessel behave? <br>
      A: It was very stormy. Heavy movements. Heavy vibrations. No abnormal noises. 
      Was in the control room when the engines stopped. Heel was then about 50°. 
      Everything rushed to the side. <br>
      8. Q: How did you get out?<br>
      A: Via the engine room and up through the emergency exit in the funnel.

      12. Q: <b>Did you see whether the hatch burst open by explosion (was blown

      behind. <br>
      13. Q: Why did you leave? Heel or water on car deck?<br>
      A: General feeling that something did happen. The emergency generator started 
      when they pulled themselves up. 15-20 seconds after they came out everything 
      became dark. Injured his hands at a hot boiler in the engine room when it 
      was dark. <br>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These question/answer notes 
    were also published in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 06.10.94, however, without the 
    question whether the bow ramp was blown open by an explosion. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much to the surprise of the Finnish and Swedish members 
    the interrogations were suddenly interrupted by Andi Meister at this time, 
    allegedly because their plane would be waiting, which was a poor excuse as 
    the plane - owned by the Estonian Coast Guard - would have waited as long 
    as required. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manner which Andi Meister chose to end 
    the first meeting of the JAIC caused considerable irritation with the Swedish 
    and Finnish members. <br>
    This was reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on the next day - 30.09.94 - as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Political manipulations 
      disturb casualty investigation. Estonian Minister blamed for forcing important 
      questioning of survivors</b>.<br>
      The Estonian chairman of the JAIC, Transport Minister Andi Meister, is committing 
      political manipulations which have already done damage to the work of the 
      JAIC. <br>
      Due to the pressure resulting from forthcoming elections in Estonia he forced 
      the first questioning of surviving crew members in Turku. "Therewith Meister, 
      having absolutely no experience with casualty investigation, has already 
      proved that he is unsuitable to lead the work", a source said. <br>
      Both the Swedish and the Finnish members of the JAIC are irritated about 
      the Estonian chairman's stopping the first interrogations held in Turku 
      on Wednesday. The JAIC had selected 3 crew members who were considered to 
      be the most interesting to be questioned: <br>
      - AB sailor Silver Linde, who went the last watch-round, just an hour before 
      the casualty, and who subsequently received instructions from the vessel's 
      command to go down to the car deck to find out what was happening there, 
      just before the vessel took the heavy list and sank. <br>
      - Engineer Henrik Sillaste who saw on the TV monitor in the engine room 
      that water was streaming onto the deck. <br>
      - the third witness was a motorman.<br>
      Interrogating the three has revealed valuable information. For the JAIC 
      it was very important to hear their reports and to put forward their questions 
      without haste and pressure. Therefore the behaviour of the Estonian Transport 
      Minister "is, at least, strange", said one of the Swedish participants. 
      "He made it understood, powerfully and determinedly, that the interrogation 
      should be stopped so that he could go back on the plane waiting at the airport 
      of Turku." The plane had been chartered by the Foreign Ministry to take 
      survivors home to Tallinn. "We carried out the questioning as well as possible. 
      Finally we understood that we were compelled to end the interrogation - 
      the plane was waiting", said one of the investigators. Various different 
      sources have confirmed the picture. <b>In addition, the Transport Minister 
      had made it quite clear that he wished a quick investigation.</b> "He believes 
      in his naiveté that the investigation can be finalised within two weeks". 
      It was apparently the intention of the Minister to present the investigation 
      report on the 'Estonia' casualty before the change of government in Estonia 
      which was forthcoming. Upon the question of the Transport Minister Meister 
      to Olof Forssberg, head of the three-man Swedish part of the JAIC, as to 
      how long it would take until the investigation is completed, Forssberg replied: 
      "About 1 year." "This answer left him considerably surprised", said one 
      source. "No perspective, no experience. He obviously has never had anything 
      to do with qualified casualty investigations", said another participant 
      at the Turku meeting."<br>
      <b>Note: </b>When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe, Andi Meister said among 
      other things: "I thought it was not the best decision to appoint me as chairman 
      because of my position." </i></font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Also the following statements 
    were made to DAGENS NYHETER and published on 29.09.94:<br>
    Kari Lethola refused to make a statement as to the possible cause of the casualty, 
    but said: <i>"However, since there is a bulkhead between the port and starboard 
    side of the car deck, shifting of cargo can be excluded ..... " </i><br>
    <b>Note:</b> He means the centre casing.<br>
    Also Carl Bildt did not wish to speculate on the causes, but stated that <i>"it 
    could not just have been the heavy weather"</i>. He added that during the 
    forthcoming investigation work<i> " ...... each stone will be turned"</i>.

      There were two masters onboard the 'Estonia'. The acting master was Arvo 
      Andresson who did not survive. <br>
      Piht was onboard to fulfil his examination to obtain the pilot licence for 
      the Stockholm archipelago. "The 4 inspections carried out by the Swedish 
      Sjöfartsinspektionen did not include the condition of visor and bow ramp. 
      This had to be done by the French classification society Bureau Veritas." 
      <br>
      "Henrik Sillaste, 25 years old, was working in the engine room when he saw 
      on the TV monitor that water was penetrating the bow ramp." "We had 'Estonia' 
      on the radar screen for exactly 8 minutes. Then she was lying stopped in 
      the water. At 01.48 hours (Finnish time) she disappeared from the radar 
      and we knew what that meant", said the Staff Commander of the Fortress Utö."

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In the evening the Swedish 
    Embassy in Moscow sent by fax an ITAR-TASS message from St. Petersburg with 
    the following wording: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"St. Petersburg September 
      29 TAS - by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev. Rumyantsev: A Russian underwater 
      expert believes people may still be alive inside the 'Estonia' ferry which 
      capsized in the Baltic Sea on Wednesday and lies at a depth of 80-90 metres.<br>
      "Hundreds of people remaining inside the sunken ferry can be saved and should 
      be saved." Anatoly Kuteinikov, designer general of the St. Petersburg based 
      'Malakhit' company told TASS on Thursday. The company is the leading Russian 
      defence enterprise producing underwater craft. <br>
      He said that an "air cushion" always accompanies any shipwreck and may allow 
      those remaining inside the ferry to stay alive for at least a week.<br>
      "One should not be scared by the excessive pressure. 80 metres are not too 
      deep", Kuteinikov said. <br>
      He regretted that the Finnish and Swedish authorities had not requested 
      the Russian rescuers to help with the 'Estonia' shipwreck. "We have a big 
      experience in underwater work, as well as good and maybe the best equipment. 
      It is a pity that we did not join efforts. Moreover, there are our citizens 
      in distress", Kuteinikov complained. The chief designer believes that the 
      main cause of the disaster was a poor training level of the crew. Besides, 
      it is also clear that the ship had some design faults. "Ships of the 'Estonia' 
      class do not sink in five minutes. They can overturn, but should stay afloat 
      for several hours to a whole day", he said." </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The JAIC continued their 
    endeavours to confirm their hypothetical casualty scenario and to improve 
    the argumentation and evidence in favour of it. It was planned to publish 
    a detailed technical Part-Report as soon as possible. Regular press statements 
    in line with the above strengthened the public opinion in the Nordic countries 
    that the main blame for the catastrophe rested with the builders, Meyer Werft 
    in Papenburg. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused the Managing Director of the yard, 
    Bernard Meyer, to instruct his lawyer, Dr. Peter Holtappels, to form an own 
    team of experts to investigate the real causes for the sinking of the ESTONIA.

  <p align="center"><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">38.1<br>
    The German 'Group of Experts'</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Dr. Peter Holtappels, senior 
    lawyer with the law firm Ahlers & Vogel, Hamburg, became the chairman of the 
    new team and engaged Prof. Dr. Eike Lehmann from the Technical University, 
    Hamburg, to perform the investigation from the Naval Architect's point of 
    view and Captain Werner Hummel, Marine Consultant and Managing Director of 
    Marine Claims Partner (Germany) GmbH, Hamburg was engaged to investigate the 
    visor condition, the ESTONIA berths in Tallinn and Stockholm and collect all 
    information relevant to the casualty. In addition, Captain Håkan Karlsson 
    from Mariehamn/Åland Islands was engaged in his capacity as one of two masters 
    having been in charge of the ESTONIA for about 12 years. Simultaneously Meyer 
    Werft nominated a member of its Design and Construction Department, Naval 
    Architect Dipl. Ing. Tomas Wilkendorf as co-ordinator of the internal yard 
    investigation and link to the 'Group of Experts'. Already the first of three 
    inspections of the visor in Hangö revealed: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that the visor, although well painted from the outside, 
    was in an extremely bad maintenance condition; - that the starboard visor 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinge had been in a very poor condition already before the 
    casualty with deep burning marks and fatigue crack propagations in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way 
    of the broken parts of the visor arm and elsewhere; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that numerous water marks inside the visor indicated that 
    the visor had been water-filled at sea up to different levels obviously &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depending 
    on the outside water height, i.e. that the visor had not been weather tight;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that the (lowest) 3rd stringer was covered with oil on 
    which fresh footprints were visible indicating substantial activity inside 
    the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visor after the water had left the visor the last time 
    before it was lifted ashore in Hangö, i.e. before the last arrival at respectively 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the last departure from Tallinn. <br>
    The areas in the aft bulkheads of the visor, where the lugs of the hydraulic 
    side locks had been located, were already burnt out and taken to Stockholm. 
    The starboard hooks of the manual side locks were crushed while the port ones 
    were intact and just bent slightly together. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big lug fitted to the after part of the 
    heavily damaged visor bottom was in place but almost cracked off the visor. 
    This lug was part of the Atlantic lock. For further details see <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    30</a>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In brief, it was very obvious that this was not a 
    normal and properly maintained visor, but a misaligned, leaking structure 
    with poorly treated and thus considerably weakened hinges and manual locks, 
    which apparently had not been engaged. The numerous footprints on the 3rd 
    and to some extent on the 2nd stringer indicated quite some activities inside 
    the closed visor which is unusual because the only installation inside the 
    visor, the Atlantic lock, was normally operated remote controlled from the 
    car deck. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later at a fortuitous meeting with 
    Uno Laur in his Tallinn office, he explained the following: <br>
    - the visor was leaking and at sea full to the outside water level; <br>
    - the hydraulic installation of the Atlantic lock was leaking as "did all 
    hydraulic installations on older vessels", thus hydraulic oil was swimming 
    on top of the water surface inside the visor when the vessel was at sea;<br>
    - the hydraulic oil caused the water marks inside the visor and, when the 
    speed was lowered, the water left the visor through the gaps in the bottom 
    and the oil settled down on the stringers, frames and on the bottom - see 
    also Subchapters <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4.</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.;</a><br>
    - as the Atlantic lock had suffered badly during the last ice winter (January 
    to March 1994) when the crew had to hack to pieces the ice inside the frozen 
    visor, it could no more be opened and closed by the hydraulic cylinder, but 
    this had to be done manually by hammering; <br>
    - therefore each time before arrival at Tallinn two crew members went down 
    and hammered the bolt open and after Tallinn they hammered the bolt closed 
    - see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a>. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: At that time it was unknown to this 'Group of Experts' that the 
    sensors had been dismounted because they were also damaged by the ice hacking 
    and as long as crew members were going down to hammer open or closed the bolt 
    of the Atlantic lock it was not required to renew the sensors, which were 
    anyway hindering the hammering. This was at least the opinion of N&T as technical 
    managers of the ferry. Had it been known, Uno Laur would certainly have been 
    asked as well and he would probably have told the real background. Now it 
    took some months longer before a Finnish engineer with a friend among the 
    2nd crew of the ESTONIA relayed the information that the sensors had been 
    dismantled because they were damaged and were causing short circuits in the 
    electrical system of the car deck and as each time when the Atlantic lock 
    had to be opened or closed the crew members went down to do the job, the sensors 
    were not needed. Before this background it is of course understandable that 
    Stenström threw the already recovered bolt of the Atlantic lock back into 
    the sea, because it clearly showed the hammering marks and also two different 
    contact marks indicating that the bolt had sometimes been fully closed and 
    sometimes only partly closed which has nevertheless been clearly established 
    from the available video footage. It is also understandable that Stenström 
    ordered the divers to burn off the sensor plate and to clip off the cut ends 
    of the sensor cables and subsequently throw both to the bottom of the sea 
    consisting of soft clay where they disappeared forever (see Subchapters <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, 
    <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27.1</a> and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> In any event, it was now 
    quite clear that the publications and statements by the JAIC were, if at all, 
    only part of the truth and that the crew and possibly also owners/technical 
    managers of the ferry had had difficulties with exactly these locking devices 
    which - according to the JAIC - had triggered off the casualty sequence-of-events 
    by their failure. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new information was evaluated and discussed 
    and by fax of 20 January Dr. Holtappels suggested a meeting with the JAIC 
    to which Börje Stenström replied on 20 January among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Appreciate the opportunity 
      to get views from a group of experts from your side, the commission is certainly 
      open for any constructive comments on the development of the accident. For 
      your information the full commission will have a meeting in Helsinki on 
      26-27 January. We do not expect to have any press conference but questions 
      from media are unavoidable. The official view of SHK was published in a 
      news release via the Swedish press news agency a week ago, stating that 
      the report of the commission was delayed because more time had been allowed 
      to the yard to complete their investigations, metallurgical investigations 
      were still going on in Stockholm and the commission had initiated a second 
      look at the weather conditions and in particular any specific wave conditions 
      at the site of the accident." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On 26 and 27 January 1994 
    the JAIC met in Helsinki and from the protocol the following items are quoted: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"4 Bow Visor <br>
      Börje Stenström presented a status report on the technical findings and 
      technical evaluation of the probable sequence of events and cause of the 
      accident. Several supporting investigations are still going on. Comments 
      from the shipyard have not yet been received. The members and experts are 
      working on the report concerning the bow visor. When the draft report is 
      ready it will be sent to the commission members and experts. Tuomo Karppinen 
      presented SSBA model experiments. Simulations will be continued. <br>
      5 The Estonian delegation presented material on the adequacy and qualifications 
      of the crew of M/V "Estonia". <br>
      6 All the lifeboats and liferafts of M/V "Estonia" which have been found 
      after the accident in Finland and Estonia have been photographed and examined 
      by the technical group for the Finnish Central Criminal Police with the 
      assistance of an expert from the Finnish Maritime Administration. A copy 
      of the report (including a selection of pictures) of one liferaft examination 
      was presented." </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> At a subsequent press conference 
    the present status was presented to the international media. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 30 January the first meeting of the German 
    'Group of Experts' was held during which the forthcoming meeting with the 
    JAIC scheduled for 16/17 February in Stockholm was prepared. A model of the 
    foreship with moveable visor and bow ramp of VIKING SALLY built by the yard 
    was presented. </font></p>

  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">February 1994</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> On 2 February Börje Stenström 
    sent his revised "Assumed Sequence of Events" with illustrating drawings - 
    see Enclosure 38.1.462 - which repeated his earlier expressed thoughts.<br>
    By fax of 7 February Stenström requested the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"1. The bottom lock. 
      You indicated that the assembly consisting of the locking plunger housing 
      and the lugs should have been a shop assembly, properly welded. As far as 
      I recall one of the engineers attending our last meeting at Papenburg (presumably 
      a shop engineer) confirmed the weld was a normal installation weld. We have 
      no detailed drawing of the bottom lock assembly except as shown in drawing 
      number 49111-373. In case there is a shipyard drawing showing such an pre-fabricated 
      assembly, including welding details, we would much appreciate a copy. <br>
      2. The side locks. We have no dimensional drawing of the side lock lugs 
      except that shown in drawings 49111-372. If there is a more detailed drawing 
      we would like a copy. We would also like, if available, a copy of the design 
      calculations for the attachment to the visor and the associated weld joint.<br>
      3. Damage to rubber seals. As far as we understand, the heavy stem post 
      on front of the visor rests against the fixed continuation on the stem/bulbous 
      vow. This determines the vertical position of the visor in closed position 
      and any change of the steel work at the rubber seals would not change the 
      vertical position of the visor. In checking with inspectors who had been 
      onboard shortly before the accident there had been no signs of changes to 
      the rubber seal installation." </i></font></p>

      According to information from Tallinn the bolt of the lock could not be

      given to us as explanation for the oil spill inside the visor and the many 
      footsteps on the 2nd and 3rd stringers. We were also told that ever since 
      then the bolt was closed and opened manually.<br>
      We have spoken with a number of ex crew members about this, but everybody 
      feels it difficult to believe that the bolt can be handled manually the 
      proper way. We would like to discuss this with you and, if possible, read 
      the relevant statements, e.g. from the witness who had reportedly seen the

    solely technical discussion </b>and from the German side the answers to the 
    questions raised by them already in November. <br>
    3. <b>Video material</b>: At first the Finns had sent down a ROV to the wreck 
    which took better pictures than the divers did. The video sent to the yard 
    does not contain ROV pictures which will, however, be made available, if requested. 
    The film sent to the yard had been made by an English diving team having examined 
    the wreck for 80-90 hours from a Norwegian semi-submersible (belonging to 
    the Norwegian Smit-Tak subsidiary) by order of the Swedish Maritime Administration. 
    The aim was to obtain material for a feasibility study in respect of the lifting 
    possibilities. Subsequently the divers were available to the JAIC for another 
    ca. 10 hours for examination of the foreship. Thereby Stenström has personally 
    directed the divers via a monitor and had a close eye on them all the time. 
    He excludes that the divers have dismounted the sensors of the Atlantic lock 
    (therefore it is established that this must have occurred before the casualty). 
    <br>
    4.<b> Recovered objects</b>: The divers have dismounted respectively burnt 
    off the well known parts including the bolt of the Atlantic lock. When they 
    were preparing the helicopter flight back some parts had to be left behind 
    due to weight restrictions. As the bolt did not show any changes except for 
    some notchings, it was left behind on the diving support vessel. He assumes 
    that the bolt has been thrown overboard in the meantime (weight ca. 25 kg). 
    The other parts will be shown to us tomorrow. We will receive name and contact 
    of the owners of the diving support vessel and shall find out where the bolt 
    actually is. <br>
    5. <b>Surviving crew members:</b> in total about 30, of whom only 4 were on 
    watch, i.e. 1 engineer, 2 motormen, 1 decksman (name: Silver Linde). He was 
    sent twice from the bridge to the car deck to check whether the ramp was still 
    tight. The last time was shortly before the catastrophe, the green lights 
    were always on. <br>
    6. <b>Atlantic lock</b>: As it had been assumed already they had not spent 
    much thought on it. The lugs are obviously broken an that is sufficient for 
    them, they thought. They have not yet realised that:<br>
    - the sensors were obviously dismounted before the casualty;<br>
    - the actuator as well as the bolt were turned about 90° towards aft; <br>
    - the port hydraulic hose was torn off. <br>
    They have no explanation for the oil spill on the lowest stringer of the visor 
    nor for the many footprints (also the technicians from N&T do not). On the 
    other hand, it is not in doubt that the heavy weather securings were not engaged.<br>
    7. <b>2 Swedish inspectors </b>have indeed inspected the vessel on the departure 
    day together with 9 Estonian trainees, however, they cannot give relevant 
    information. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: This means that Stenström began the "cooperation" with this 'Group 
    of Experts' with two untrue statements, namely: <br>
    (a) he alleged to have left the bolt onboard, although actually he had personally 
    thrown it overboard; and<br>
    (b) he stated that the two inspectors had no relevant information, although 
    at that time he had known for more than 3 months that those inspectors had 
    found such grave deficiencies on the ferry that they had tried to stop her 
    from sailing - see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a>

    Stockholm on 16/17 February and was attended by the persons mentioned on the 
    previous pages.<br>
    Stenström advised that it was not the aim of the JAIC to blame somebody for 
    the casualty, but to establish the facts, i.e. the causes, and to issue recommendations 
    for the future which should avoid a repetition. He emphasized that the Swedish 
    part of the JAIC - Statens Havarie Kommission - is completely independent 
    and comparable to the U.S. National Transportation Board, while the Finnish 
    part, headed by its permanent chairman Kari Lethola, was attached to the Ministry 
    of Justice and the Estonian part was formed exclusively for this investigation.<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The open questions concerning 
    the locking devices of the visor were discussed in detail and in every thinkable 
    direction, however, whenever maintenance matters were discussed uncertainty 
    came up especially on the Estonian side. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a respective question the Finnish and Swedish 
    JAIC members explained that interrogation of the Estonian crew members as 
    well as all questions concerning the vessel, the shipping company, the organisation 
    and operation were exclusively dealt with by the Estonian JAIC member, Uno 
    Laur, because the other two members were the Transport Minister and the Head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO who could not - or only restrictively 
    - participate in the daily work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are obvious: Only that information 
    was passed to the Swedish/Finnish JAIC which did not affect Estonian interests 
    or which was already public. It was thus not surprising that the same Uno 
    Laur who had explained to a member of this 'Group of Experts' only 4 weeks 
    earlier - in the presence of one of his Finnish clients - why the footprints 
    were in the oil on the stringer, now tried to convince the audience that the 
    Atlantic lock had been operated hydraulically up to the end. It became obvious 
    in the course of the two days that the JAIC had not even considered to investigate 
    the condition of the vessel before her last departure and was content with 
    their hypothetical cause consideration and casualty sequence-of-events which 
    - "so sorry" - did put the blame almost entirely on the builders. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the meeting, the personal talks with 
    the Finnish participants and, in particular, with Börje Stenström were very 
    open in response to the many questions concerning the circumstances of the 
    casualty, the route, weather, crew and all the many relevant details of which 
    this 'Group of Experts' knew practically nothing, but which were of crucial 
    importance for the investigation. The Estonian participants in the discussions 
    tried to do everything to avoid the creation of a bad impression of vessel 
    and crew. When for example the subject "ice damage to vessel and visor" was 
    raised because the visor had obviously at least two quite heavy old damages, 
    Uno Laur said: <i>"It was a very, very mild winter. What should have happened. 
    Moreover the vessel had ice class 1A.</i>" Actually the Gulf of Finland and 
    the Middle and Northern Baltic were covered by thick ice from the end of January 
    to the beginning of April 1994 - see Subchapter 12.4.2 - and the ferry had 
    frequently been used as an "ice breaker". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The hypothetical scenario 
    of the JAIC had, however, serious weaknesses and some of them became very 
    apparent at the meeting. These were mainly: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(a) the condition of the 
      locking devices as found;<br>
      (b) the uncertainty whether the locking devices were still original; <br>
      (c) the apparent fact that the maintenance and damage history of visor, 
      bow ramp, its locking devices and hinges had not been examined at all before 
      arriving at and going public with their scenario and the conclusions therefrom; 
      <br>
      (d) the apparent fact that visor seals were missing/damaged and the visor 
      had been full of water to the outside level at sea with (then) unknown consequences. 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Being so sure about their 
    scenario the Finns for example agreed to the visor condition as explained 
    under (d) above, while Stenström and the Estonians smelled trouble and were 
    reluctant. In any event, Karppinen and Rahka fully agreed that the visor had 
    always been full of water at sea, however later with-drew from this admission 
    completely, when they realised what consequences water in the visor had in 
    combination with a damaged bow ramp: water on the car deck. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the JAIC meeting in March in Tallinn among 
    other things also the protocol of the statement of the nautical student Rain 
    Oolmets to the criminal police in Tallinn made already on 03.10.94, i.e. 6 
    months before, was handed over to the Swedes/Finns. The reason for the long 
    delay in presenting this important statement to the JAIC is obvious: It dealt 
    with up to 10-cm long cracks in the welding seams of the visor hinges observed 
    by the student only some weeks before the casualty when he was the member 
    of a working team. See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a> 
    and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.177.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.5.177 - .179</a>. It was agreed that the man should identify the cracks 
    at the hinge remains of the visor in Hangö and Enn Neidre took over the arrangements 
    (apparently no one told him that the hinge remains had been cut off from the 
    visor already in January and were now at the KTH in Stockholm). In any event 
    the Swedish chairman, Olof Forssberg, wrote to the Estonian chairman, Andi 
    Meister, on 20 March among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"We agreed in Tallinn 
      to question two witnesses about the observation of cracks ........ " </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Andi Meister replied on the 
    following day, 27 March, among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Referring to the Protocol 
      of Interrogation which was discussed by the Commission on the last meeting 
      ... Rudissaar, whom Oolmets claims he told about the matter, knows nothing

      a Mr. Gunnar Kull, who should know more</b>. Captain E. Neidre, member of 
      the commission, shall arrange <b>the trip to Helsinki for Oolmets and Kull.</b>

      and they will go to Hanko by car."</i></font></p>

    Investigation and Communication</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In the course of the following 
    days tank conditions and cargo distribution - then known by the JAIC, but 
    later proven to be incomplete - the Finnish videos made by ROVs in the early 
    days, and some stability calculations and other documents were received. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a subsequent letter Börje Stenström wrote 
    to Dr. Holtappels, the chairman of this 'Group of Experts' among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I had the opportunity 
      to see part of your instructions to the team members and noted with appreciation 
      that they are instructed to work unbiased. I also feel that we were able 
      to do so during our meeting. I do disagree, however, with your little indication 
      that the international commission should not be unbiased. I would like you 
      to rest assured that the commission has only three goals, to establish what 
      hap-pened, why it happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. 
      I am speaking for the Swedish part of the commission in this matter since 
      we have a firm policy in this regard established by law. I take it that 
      our policy will also be valid for the entire commission as we do, in reality, 
      have the lead." </i><br>
      <b>Note:</b> The "little indication" that the JAIC might not be entirely 
      unbiased refers, of course, to the Estonian JAIC members Andi Meister and 
      Enn Neidre. The apparent fact that the Swedes had the "lead", although the 
      Estonians had been awarded the chairmanship, reflects the factual situation. 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The communication and exchange 
    of documentation and information with JAIC, in particular with Stenström, 
    went on and by fax of 28 March among other things the so-called "Explanatory 
    Note" was received - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.172</a> - which was apparently meant to be the Estonian answer to the 
    allegation of this 'Group of Experts' that the sensors of the Atlantic lock 
    had been dismounted some time before the casualty. The note, however, merely 
    states that the sensors on the ESTONIA were magnetic and not mechanical - 
    as stated on the drawings - and that during the time under Estonian flag the 
    sensors had not been changed, moreover that it was believed that these sensors 
    had been installed at newbuilding already because there were numerous others 
    of this type on other installations. In other words: the drawings of the yard 
    were wrong. This was not the case as was subsequently established when previous 
    Finnish electricians declared when and why they had changed the initial mechanical 
    sensors against the magnetic ones. See Subchapter 3.3.6, pages 42/43 of the 
    Final JAIC Report. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By fax of 29 March Stenström sent among other 
    things the Cargo Manifest by which he considered<i> "the truck loads to be 
    properly documented and the truck loads to look quite harmless"</i>. It is 
    revealed from the fax prints on top of the pages that it had been sent on 
    27 September 1994 at 18.38 hours from Estline-Tallinn and that Stenström had 
    received it on 29.11.94 from N&T. See also <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.211</a> and <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 17.1</a>. 
    The manifest contains 39 trucks of which the last one was added in handwriting 
    although there were actually 40 onboard according to the Customs List - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.213.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.213</a>. This list had been in the hands of the Finnish police since 
    14.10.94 already, however it is unknown when it was sent to Sweden. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, Stenström must have had in the early 
    days some other manifest or list or information because by fax of 30.11.94 
    he informed SSPA (Ship Model Testing Facility) that there had been 34 trucks/trailers 
    onboard only - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.3.462.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    38.3.462</a> and this went into the weight calculations for the first model 
    tests in the tank to establish the wave load on the visor/and the locking 
    devices. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection attention has also to be drawn 
    to a further mistake made in this above-mentioned fax about weight distribution 
    because Stenström wrote: <i>"tanks 13 + 14 (starboard and port heeling tanks) 
    183 ts"</i>. He means though - according to his own statement during his first 
    visit to Papenburg on 27 October 1994 - that the port heeling tank - no. 14 
    - had been completely filled with 183 ts., while the starboard tank had been 
    left empty - see also <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    17.1</a> and <a href="29.5.htm" target="_blank">29.5</a>. In a stability and 
    trim calculation received earlier, performed by Ship Consulting Oy, Turku 
    on behalf of the Finnish JAIC and dated 01.12.94 - see Enclosure 38.3 - <b>both</b> 
    heeling tanks are stated to have been filled completely with 185 ts each plus 
    <b>34</b> trailers. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By fax of 10 March Börje Stenström had already 
    distributed his "Draft Technical Report", the forerunner to the Part-Report, 
    among other things also to Dr. Holtappels. Already on the following day the 
    conclusions - pointing, of course, to Papenburg - could be read in "DAGENS 
    NYHETER" and the Berlin paper "TAZ". It revealed subsequently that the Sea 
    Safety Director of Sjöfarts-verket, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, had given a copy 
    to DAGENS NYHETER and the Estonian JAIC member Uno Laur had sold a copy to 
    TAZ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same day Jutta Rabe from SPIEGEL TV 
    interviewed Börje Stenström in his Stockholm office and after respective questions 
    Stenström admitted to have personally thrown overboard the bolt of the Atlantic 
    lock - see also the<a href="37.2.htm" target="_blank"> Subchapter 37.2.</a> 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the further interview he was asked 
    whether they had examined the visor and the wreck for ice damage and his reply 
    was:<i> "We had no indications for ice damage: it was a rather mild winter 
    (he had been shown the ice charts only 3 weeks before) and there were no indications 
    for such damage. At least, as far as we know</i>", and further:<i> "Anyway, 
    I believe that possible ice damage has not been examined, however, I am not 
    quite sure. A good question you are raising. We should possible check that."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> In this context it has to be mentioned that 
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' attended the hearings of several crew 
    survivors as technical consultant of a German TV team and this was the first 
    time that direct questions could be asked to key witnesses. One of the results 
    was the drawing made by the survivor Henrik Sillaste about his observations 
    on the monitor in the engine control room after the big heel. The drawing 
    - see Enclosure 21.2.4 - shows the bow ramp in slightly open condition with 
    water pressing through the gaps at both sides under pressure, however, more 
    at starboard side. The drawing, confirmed by the other two survivors from 
    the engine control room, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak - see <a href="21.2.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    21.2.3</a> and <a href="21.2.5.htm" target="_blank">21.2.5 </a>- proved that 
    the bow ramp had still been closed or almost closed after the big heel, while 
    according to the casualty scenario of the JAIC, the big heel was caused by 
    huge water quantities having entered the car deck after the bow ramp had been 
    pulled completely open by the forward tumbling visor. This was evidently wrong 
    because the bow ramp was still been in the almost closed position when Sillaste 
    and Kadak left the engine control room at a list of 30°/40°. From the very 
    beginning of their testimonies Treu, Sillaste and Kadak have testified this 
    water penetration at both sides of the bow ramp after the big heel. This was 
    also reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and DAGENS NYHETER during the early days, 
    however, unfortunately was ignored by the JAIC.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the "Draft Technical Report" of the JAIC 
    which was analysed in detail by this 'Group of Experts'. After considerable 
    discussions it was agreed not to comment on this draft report since it was 
    out anyway and, in particular, since the JAIC was under no circumstances prepared 
    to change its substance in preparation of the Part Report due to be published 
    in early April. Instead Dr. Holtappels gave an interview to Lloyd's List which 
    was published in the 17 March issue and reads as:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"German Yard inquiry 
      finds lock system was altered MEYER WERFT HITS BACK ON 'ESTONIA' An investigation 
      into the loss of the Baltic ferry 'Estonia' by the German yard which built 
      her is set to counter Swedish press claims that a weak lock was responsible 
      for the disaster. Meyer Werft, which is due to publish its first findings 
      early next week, will claim that safety indicators had been tampered with 
      and that the 'Estonia' was operating on a route where she would not have 
      been. Lawyer and former shipowner Peter Holtappels, who heads the commission, 
      said the findings would shed "a very different light" on the tragic accident 
      than the impression given by parts of the report of the international commission 
      published by the Swedish media. The preliminary German report claims that 
      the safety indicators on the bridge showing whether the bow visor was locked 
      had been tampered with to display permanent "green". It also alleges that 
      the sensors on the major device, the Atlantic lock, had been removed. Dr. 
      Holtappels declined to comment further on the claims but insisted that "the 
      ship set sail from Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition" </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On 6 April the representatives 
    of the relatives were informed in Stockholm by the Swedish JAIC about the 
    contents and conclusions of the Part-Report, i.e. that the sequence-of-events 
    which led to the capsizing and sinking of the ESTONIA had been initiated by 
    the failure of the locking devices of the visor, in particular the Atlantic 
    lock. Allegedly the locking system had been 50 per cent under-dimensioned. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any questions concerning speed, behaviour of 
    the crew, organisation of owners/managers were not answered with reference 
    to the Final Report to be published by the end of the year. On the following 
    day the Part-Report was introduced simultaneously in press conferences by 
    the JAIC parts in Tallinn, Helsinki and Stockholm and copies were distributed 
    to the media. In the introduction letter to the Part-Report Stenström states 
    among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The full report, covering 
      also operational aspects and other outstanding matters is expected to be 
      published in the autumn of this year. The Commission is fully aware of the 
      disadvantages of publishing a part report that deals with only one segment 
      of the circumstances contributing to the accident. It has, however, been 
      assumed to be of value to make the present findings available at an early 
      stage to all sectors of the maritime world, working with various aspects 
      of the safety of passengers ships."</i></font></p>

      "Part-Report Concerning Technical Issues on the Capsizing on 28 September 
      1994 in the Baltic Sea of the Ro-Ro Passenger Vessel M.V. Estonia" reads 
      as follows:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>" The bow visor locking 
      devices failed due to loads generated by the hydrodynamic forces on the 
      bow visor at the prevailing speed, heading and wave conditions. </i></font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The visor locking

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> Following failure 
      of the locking devices the visor pounded heavily on the stem structure before

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The failure of the 
      bow visor caused the ramp to be forced open due to mechanical interference 
      between the visor and the ramp, inherent in the design. This design arrangement 
      had crucial consequences for the development of the accident." </i> </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The previous hypothesis had 
    become "conclusion" now and the JAIC made it quite clear in the Preface to 
    the "Part-Report" that it was not their intention ever to change these "conclusions" 
    when they stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The Commission has 
      previously concluded that the accident was initiated by the locking devices 
      for the bow visor being unable to withstand the loads imposed during the 
      prevailing speed, heading and sea conditions. This conclusion is still valid. 
      This part-report covers main technical findings and conclusions. The final 
      report to be issued later will cover also all other factors and circumstances 
      found to have contributed to the development of the accident. This will 
      include inter alia operational practices, certification and inspections, 
      stability information, weather conditions and train-ing. Rescue operations 
      and resources will be covered as well." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In other words, whatever 
    the investigation ahead, for example of "<i>operational practices</i>" and 
    "<i>inspections</i>", might reveal "<i>it is anticipated that all facts and 
    conclusions reported herein (the visor locking devices were calculated with 
    less strength than required according to calculations) remain unchanged in 
    substance</i>". "<i>Operational practices</i>" for example includes the forcing 
    of ice barriers several meters high at sea with full speed and the respective 
    affect on the locking devices, the hinges and the visor structure in general, 
    just to mention one example. For more examples see <a href="12.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    12.4</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Stenström continued with considerable energy 
    to distribute his "present findings" - the term in itself implies that the 
    findings are not final - to the maritime world by giving papers, for example 
    at the IMO meeting on 31.10.94 and at the Marine Safety Seminar of the Cologne 
    Re in Rotterdam - in 1995 - when he submitted his "present" findings as firmly 
    established facts. He said in Rotterdam under the heading:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>MS Estonia</b> 
      <br>
      1. Aspects of Human Shortcomings <br>
      Sorting out the various contributory factors, it is obvious that the structural 
      strength of the bow visor, the sea conditions and the speed of the vessel 
      all contributed, and any one of these factors could be seen as triggering 
      the catastrophe or could have prevented it. In the prevailing sea conditions 
      two basic factors remain: The design of the locking device of the bow visor 
      was too weak, and the speed of the vessel was too high under the prevailing 
      conditions. The systems' inadequacies may be divided into three groups: 
      Technical inadequacies, regulatory inadequacies and operational inadequacies.<br>
      2. Technical inadequacies<br>
      On the technical side, the classification rules valid at the time, and in 
      particular those according to which the ship was built, were not very detailed 
      and did not contain sufficient guidance for the design of the visor attachment 
      devices. The shipyard designer did the best he could with the advice available 
      and the result of his work would have been reasonably acceptable, albeit 
      at the lower end of the scale. The manufacturing side of the shipyard, however, 
      acted on quite different and unqualified information and built locking arrangements 
      for the visor which had less than half the strength of the outcome of the 
      calculation work. The visor attachment arrangements therefore had a total 
      strength to failure of about one third to one half of what it should have 
      had based on the knowledge of the sea loads at the time. The locking devices 
      then failed under conditions equivalent to the assumed design load conditions. 
      Such loads existed as extreme values under the prevailing speed and sea 
      conditions. If the shipyard had had a quality assurance system similar to 
      the current requirements under ISO 9000 there would have been routine procedures 
      ensuring that the manufacturing was carried out on the basis of correct 
      information." </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Regardless of all this the 
    exchange of information, the communication between this 'Group of Experts' 
    and the JAIC, especially Stenström, continued and was even deepened during 
    the coming months after Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister had become a consultant to this 
    'Group of Experts' in metallurgical matters. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason for the engagement of Prof. 
    Dr. Hoffmeister of the University of the Armed Forces in Hamburg was the obvious 
    attitude of the JAIC to state that the fractures of the locking devices and 
    hinges had been caused in the overload mode while even the layman could see 
    fatigue cracks at different vital places. Another reason was that the visor 
    had to be examined in detail by a qualified metallurgist. In the course of 
    the following weeks Prof. Hoffmeister closely inspected the visor and the 
    parts already cut off and recovered from the wreck. After some time a relatively 
    close co-operation developed with Prof. Kjell Pettersson from KTH, Stockholm, 
    who had performed the metallurgical examination on behalf of the JAIC. The 
    results of the investigations by Prof. Hoffmeister were laid down in draft 
    reports nos. 1 to 4. Draft report no. 4 is still valid, because Prof. Hoffmeister 
    is still expecting parts from the wreck for examination which would enable 
    him to make final conclusions. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: The owners have repeatedly refused to let Prof. Hoffmeister have 
    the parts in their possession for his examination. Simultaneously the exchange 
    of views and information with Börje Stenström continued more or less uninterrupted. 
    On 21 April there was a further meeting between Stenström and a member of 
    this 'Group of Experts' when a complete set of photos made of the visor and 
    the foundations of both visor actuators were handed over to Stenström with 
    interpretation. Stenström's attention was drawn to the accumulation of oil 
    in the forepart of the 3rd stringer indicating that either the vessel must 
    have had a forward trim more or less all the time and/or the visor had been 
    misaligned in relation to the vessel possibly due to a pressed in stempost. 
    Furthermore Stenström's attention was drawn to the fact that the port visor 
    actuator was no more connected to the B-deck at the time of the casualty. 
    He was only mildly interested, but told the story of the Landvetter meeting 
    instead:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"All the main witnesses 
      were questioned again - especially watch A.B. Silver Linde - however, in 
      the presence of Enn Neidre, the superior of all ESCO sailors, which was 
      regrettable but unavoidable because Neidre insisted and he was a JAIC member. 
      The main aim of this meeting had been to find out what had happened on the 
      bridge, why they had been so passive. According to Silver Linde the 2nd 
      and 3rd officers had left the bridge after 01.00-01.05 hours, thus at that 
      time they considered everything to be normal and routine. About 5 or 10 
      minutes later the vessel suddenly took a starboard list of about 20° and 
      started a sharp port turn which increased the starboard heel. It seemed 
      possible that the 2nd and 4th, mates, then on the bridge, were knocked off 
      their feet and became unconscious. Then probably the (other) 2nd mate and 
      the 3rd mate returned to the bridge, transmitted "Mayday" and "Mr. Skylight 
      to No. 1 & 2" and asked the engine room whether it was possible to pump 
      over water to the high side. Survivors have confirmed that the lee side 
      was the high side. A port turn has also been confirmed by the position of 
      lost objects found on the sea bottom. Silver Linde had stated that when 
      he was ordered to check the ramp to take the boatswain with him. The passenger 
      who heard the hydraulic sound was midships on 4th deck - they believe he 
      heard the stabilisers. There are no indications that they used the hydraulic 
      actuators to hold down the visor."</i></font></p>

    meeting. See also Subchapters <a href="21.2.2.htm" target="_blank">21.2.2</a>,

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Part-Report was discussed 
    and Stenström's attention was drawn to the many mistakes, e.g. the <i>"disappeared 
    stempost"</i> and the impossibility that the control lights were all green 
    if the port lower bolt of the bow ramp had not engaged the pocket, etc. Finally 
    Stenström was asked, why did they state in the Part-Report that <i>"in all 
    probability the sequence of events and cause consideration will not be changed"</i> 
    because evidently they had not even covered 10% of the required investigation 
    extent. After some thinking, Stenström said: <i>"These are our instructions 
    and please don't ask us any more questions in this respect. We had to draft 
    our report to the effect that the blame is more or less entirely resting with 
    Meyer Werft, however, in the Final Report we shall draft it so vaguely that 
    there will be not enough evidence to commence legal action against the yard, 
    in other words, after our Final Report has come out, nobody can be blamed 
    and the case will be closed shortly afterwards"</i>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the following weeks and the 
    ongoing exchange of views and information Stenström admitted that his Part-Report 
    was wrong in some respects, however, when it came to water in the visor, which 
    evidently had been there, he was not prepared to give in. After this 'Group 
    of Experts' had written, on 16 June:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"As to water in the 
      visor which was flowing out once the vessel had reduced speed and the bow-wave 
      became smaller we do not mean the crewmen of the pilot boat, but some Stockholm 
      pilots who have observed the above, and they are not talking about just 
      150 litres. On the other hand the fact that at sea the inside of the visor 
      was filled up to outside level with water due to poor or missing rubberseals 
      was admitted by Ulf Hobro at our discussion in your presence mid February."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Stenström replied already 
    on 22 June:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I think there is nobody 
      claiming that the space inside the visor was dry. It is not even required 
      to be watertight by their rules. In a seaway water will be pushed in through 
      any leaking seals at a higher rate than it would flow out when the bow rises 
      out of the water and some water may have been there in bad weather. Please 
      consider, how-ever, that the ramp seals were probably not 100 per cent watertight 
      either, in particular not at the lower edge due to some play in the hinges 
      and the fact that one locking wedge had not found its way fully into its 
      female part. Any steady level of water inside the visor should therefore 
      undoubtedly leak past the ramp into the car deck area. The area was inspected 
      regularly, even shortly before the accident, and there was no water in the 
      ramp area. Have therefore difficulties in believing in the existence of 
      any large amount of water in the visor that could have influenced the dynamics 
      of the visor in a seaway."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Of course Stenström could 
    under no circumstances accept large quantities of water inside the visor because 
    at that time he knew already of the partly open bow ramp at the port lower 
    corner which meant water on the car deck which evidently had been the case 
    already in 1993 - see <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 12.4.4</a>, 
    especially the statement of pilot Bo Söderman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also another principle matter was seen differently 
    by Stenström and this 'Group of Experts', viz. the non-recorded respectively 
    non-documented repairs. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>4. Visor Structure 
      </b><br>
      You might have good control about the documented repairs ,but what abut 
      the ones not documented? Who has and when carried out the highly insufficient 
      repairs to lower lugs at B-Deck of the port actuator (hydraulic cylinder), 
      just to mention one example? These repairs as well as changing of bushings 
      of the visor hinges e.g. are subject to class inspection and repair approval, 
      which, as you know, has not been the case." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström replied:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"It is quite possible, 
      and normal onboard any ship, that small defects are repaired onboard, e.g. 
      the crack in the stiffener underneath the port side platform for the lifting 
      actuator. Replacing a hinge bushing is a different things, that would be 
      a considerable undertaking even at a shipyard and can certainly not be undertaken 
      whilst in service. There are no indications in all the records we have examined 
      of such a repair, superintendents and other people who have followed the 
      ship also deny that any such work should have been carried out. Why should 
      it have been done secretly if there had been a need??? In case there had 
      been a need to remove the bushing, burning off the old weld would undoubtedly 
      have resulted in burning marks in tangential direction on the plating around 
      the weld. There are no such marks. The cutting marks in the holes are perfectly 
      perpen-dicular to the plate and cannot be generated by burning on an existing 
      completed installation. Had there been a need for repair due to play, the 
      old bronze bushing would undoubtedly have been removed by local machining. 
      This is shipyard standard practice for relining any worn shaft bushing from 
      propeller shaft bearings down to small diameters. As all four visor arm 
      side plates have identical appearance, would you suggest that all four bushings 
      were replaced by the crew in secrecy? The hinge bushing was inspected by 
      Professor Hoffmeister last week and we had a few more sections cut and examined 
      according to his desire. I hope he got the information he was looking for 
      and will appreciate a copy of his report. The extra work has been done on 
      behalf of the SHK as it is in our interest as well to find maximum amount 
      of facts." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström made it quite clear 
    that the JAIC was of the definite opinion that the deep burning marks were 
    caused by the yard already at newbuilding and did not hesitate to tell that 
    also to the media. He was, however, wrong in almost all respects, because:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - at the starboard hinges 
    were indications of tangential burning marks although covered by the welding 
    seams; <br>
    - the perpendicular burning marks can very well be generated by burning on 
    an existing completed installation as it was proved by a respective test carried 
    out by Meyer Werft in summer 1995 - see the photo below and see also <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    30</a> - S3/P3. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/report%20pics/partc/Page122.jpg" width="462" height="392"></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- all four arms do not have 
    identical appearances as it is evident from the two photos below, the left 
    one shows the port outer visor arm and the right one the starboard inner visor 
    arm.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/report%20pics/partc/Page%20123.jpg" width="493" height="357"></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Evidently the starboard visor 
    arm plate looks identical to the test burnt installation part - see the photo 
    above - and the port one is smooth without burning marks at all. A detailed 
    inspection even revealed indications of circumferential drilling marks as 
    initially the holes were drilled at newbuilding - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    2.4.6</a>. Therefore this 'Group of Experts' has always taken and still does 
    take the view that the port bushings were still original while the starboard 
    ones were very unprofessionally replaced. How gross negligently this replacement 
    was carried out became fully clear when a passenger video was made available 
    to this 'Group of Experts' in 1996 - see Subchapter 39.2. </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This 'Group of Experts' presented 
    their findings and the sequence-of-events supported by the metallurgical evaluations 
    of Prof. Hoffmeister, all of which was discussed at the end.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The JAIC admitted that 
    the visor was already substantially damaged when the vessel departed from 
    Tallinn.<br>
    - The JAIC admitted that the visor hinges were considerably weakened by fatigue.<br>
    - The JAIC admitted that the existing poor condition of the hinges and locking 
    devices does not necessarily result from bad performance of the new-building 
    yard if no repair work was found to be documented or otherwise recorded. <br>
    - It was agreed that Prof. Hoffmeister should make further detailed examinations 
    of the hinges and Atlantic lock parts in close cooperation with KTH Stockholm 
    and VTT Helsinki. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Finally, Dr. Holtappels indicated 
    that the JAIC had to be considered biased due to the presence of the head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO in the Commission, because ESCO having 
    been 50% owner and crew manager of the ESTONIA was one of the subjects of 
    the ongoing investigation. This was received by the audience in silence.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In summary it could be concluded 
    that the JAIC got the message that their scenario was not necessarily the 
    only one and that other circumstances had played a dominant role in the sinking 
    of the ESTONIA and, further, that this 'Group of Experts' was not prepared 
    to accept that the "scenario and main findings" of the Part-Report would remain 
    "unchanged in substance". In those days this 'Group of Experts' still believed 
    that the JAIC - being a governmental institution - wanted to find out the 
    truth, maybe apart from the Estonians, however, the first shadows of doubt 
    arose in particular created by the behaviour of Börje Stenström. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>39.1<br>
    Communication and Investigation up to March 1996</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In January some time was 
    spent drafting the reply to Börje Stenström's letter of 22.12.95 which - finally 
    - was agreed and sent by fax of 22.01.96 to Sweden. As the contents is of 
    some importance the questions with answers shall be quoted below:<br>
    1. On top of pages 4 and 6 you say that von Tell submitted and B.V. approved 
    load calculations for the locking devices. The only document we know about 
    is the short telex from von Tell to B.V. informing that they had used LR rules 
    for defining the strength of the locking devices and were somewhat high on 
    shear stress (must presumably refer to the locking bolt). Have you seen any 
    calculations?"<br>
    as to 1:<br>
    We have seen part of the telex exchange between von Tell-Hamburg and Gothenburg 
    and also have seen some of their memos. From both it is revealed that there 
    have been discussions (probably by telephone) between BV-Hamburg and von Tell-Gothenburg, 
    and it has to be concluded that von Tell-Gothenburg have made calculations. 
    This is also confirmed by the telex you have quoted and which is in your possession. 
    To answer your question, we have not seen any of the von Tell calculations 
    as we do not know where the files from von Tell-Gothenburg are, if they should 
    still exist. We do conclude, however, from what we have read and heard from 
    von Tell-Hamburg that such calculations have been made."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">2. On page 6 you further 
    say that von Tell produced drawings sent to the yard for production. The von 
    Tell drawings showed the von Tell deliveries and the complete assembly but 
    not installation arrangements. Agree that the parts indicated by von Tell 
    as "Werft Lieferung" are not clearly identified as information or as manufacturing 
    guidance and we say in our text that this may have been misleading."<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 2: <br>
    The parts marked "Werft Lieferung" in the von Tell drawings are generally 
    according to scale respectively oversized in case they had to be made to fit 
    for installation onboard. These parts are always drawn in such a way respectively 
    the dimensions are stated in such detail that burning diagrams for the 1:10 
    shop could easily be made and/or the detail drawings were directly used for 
    production. When questioning the yard workers having done the above-mentioned 
    work in 1980 there was not the slightest indication that this "may have been 
    misleading" - as you say in your report." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">3. On bottom of page 6 you 
    say that the yard compared the von Tell design requirements with own results. 
    Again, where are von Tell design requirements given?"<br>
    "as to 3: <br>
    When we say von Tell design requirements then we mean dimensions and form 
    of the von Tell parts as could be taken from the drawings respectively from 
    the information on the drawings supplied by von Tell. In other words, the 
    yard obtained the load requirements which von Tell had based their dimensioning 
    of the locking devices on by drawing conclusion from these dimensions and 
    comparing the results with own calculations. In addition, this matter was 
    certainly also discussed on the telephone, possibly personally."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">4. Page 7, item a), refers 
    to welding tables instead of drawing information. The steel drawing for the 
    visor does indeed contain very detailed welding information for welds which 
    may be regarded as standard, such as butt joints between plates of different 
    thickness. It is lacking, however, details of the non-standard welds, such 
    as welding 60 mm thick plating. This seems to be contrary to your explanation." 
    <br>
    as to 4:<br>
    The steel drawing does contain some welding information and we agree to your 
    statement that butt joints between 2 plates of different thickness have to 
    be regarded as standard. This, however, does not refer to shape of the respective 
    steel plate edges. It is for this reason that at the lower right corner of 
    drawing 1103 very detailed dimension sketches can be found. The same refers 
    to other dimension sketches on other parts of this drawing. We assume that 
    your missing welding information is for the 60 mm plate. This can be found 
    in way of the visor arms (butt joints) as well as on the very detailed sketch 
    of the welds of the cylinder lifting lugs. In both cases, however, the measurement 
    information does not refer to the thickness of the welding seams but to the 
    preparation for the welding seams. The thickness of the welds is only indicated 
    by the thick-black coloured area. For comparison please look at the detail 
    "visor arm/bushing", where you will not find any measurement. Consequently 
    no welding preparation was required because a fillet weld was planned. The 
    black-coloured area, however, indicates a rather thick weld and reference 
    is made in this respect to page 8c, i.e. the thickness of the weld should 
    be between 50% and 70% of the thickness of the structural member to be welded. 
    Due to the very clearly and easily recognisable black-coloured area the welders 
    could not understand why they should not have followed instructions." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">5. Page 8, item (b). the 
    lugs of the bottom lock show clearly that the holes for the bushings were 
    made by machine flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges show at several places 
    a machine flame cutting pattern. (The coarse flame cutting pattern still being 
    a question-mark.)" <br>
    as to 5: <br>
    We have to assume that the lugs for the bottom locks including the holes in 
    the lugs for the bushings had been made by the 1:10 shop by means of machine 
    flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges, however, have been definitely drilled. 
    This is confirmed by the evidence of those who have done it in 1980, the respective 
    drawings, photos and, last but not least, the remains of the hinges at KTH. 
    In particular, the outer port hinge - showing only very minor burning marks 
    at one location - demonstrates the original condition of the hinges at time 
    of delivery, whilst at the stb. hinges due to the severe burning marks 10-15 
    mm material is missing. This is contrary to your previous statement when you 
    said that the initial thickness would be still there.<br>
    In summary we agree that the holes in the lugs for the bushings of the Atlantic 
    lock have probably been machine flame cut, although we have not yet found 
    the respective drawing for the 1:10 shop (probably due to the use of "Diana 
    II" drawings). As far as the holes for the hinge bushings are concerned, however, 
    we emphasize that these were drilled, which we are able to prove and have 
    done so already. We strongly suggest that you re-measure the hinge remains 
    at KTH again and you will find out that at the stb. hinges there is 10-15 
    mm material less than at the port hinges. That leads to the conclusion that 
    at the stb. hinges at least 10 mm material was missing (taken away by the 
    burning) which at port side is still there. What effect that had on the alignment 
    of the visor you may conclude yourself." </font></p>

    as to 7: <br>
    "Viking Sally" was not a few hundred tons lighter than originally estimated, 
    but during the building phase the steel weight was continuously controlled 
    very carefully in order to avoid overweight which would reduce the deadweight 
    figure. As a matter of fact, AB Sally commenced arbitration proceedings against 
    Meyer Werft claiming that the vessel was too heavy and thus could not carry 
    the contracted deadweight, which, however, was not found by the arbitrators.<br>
    All this has nothing to do with the welding seams which, in total, correspond 
    only to max. 2% of the steel weight. <br>
    Your assumption is probably based on the well known fact that Meyer Werft 
    vessels have proved to be heavier and stronger than ordered for decades."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 8. Page 12, 4th para. We 
    have no documentation showing that the bottom lock was installed to meet a 
    design load of 132 tons. If available, please provide. Bottom of the same 
    page, the safety factor is not so easily defined in a design where base material 
    and welds carry the load simultaneously because the welds have some much lower 
    ductility once the yielding strength is exceeded." <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 8: <br>
    The 132 ts figure is based on 7.5 mm welds and on a permissible tension of 
    150 N/mm². (7.5 mm welds were initially applied.) The safety factor considered 
    can be defined as the proportion between the nominal tension and the tension 
    of the breaking tension of the basis material."</font></p>

    around 100 tons when subjected to the combined pulling and bending force. 
    This matches the actual tests carried out in Helsinki." <br>
    as to 9: <br>
    The lugs of the side locks were made according to von Tell drawing. The yard 
    has made sure that the length was sufficient. The relatively low LCC of the 
    side locks is not due to the too short lugs but due to the wrongly placed 
    stiffeners at the bulkheads behind the lugs."</font></p>

    as to 11:<br>
    - We have also had more closer looks at the mounting plate in question and 
    still did not find any sign of sensors, which, according to a member of the 
    relief crew had been removed already several months before (due to damage 
    sustained during the ice-winter 1994). In our opinion it is also clear from 
    the videos that the cables for the sensors have been cut. <br>
    - The condition of the rubber packings we have discussed so many times and 
    we have nothing to add to this. <br>
    - The visor was not flooded during sea trials (there were 4 people present, 
    among them the BV surveyor Lohmann and the von Tell representative Todsen). 
    At 22 kn speed and vessel pitching in head sea near Helgoland some water was 
    leaking through the packing. After return to Emden they carried out the chalk-test 
    and found that the packing at one location was not fitting tightly enough; 
    a flat bar was welded in way, the packing fitted again, a high pressure hose 
    test was carried out, and the visor was accepted as being weathertight by 
    owners, BV, Yard and von Tell. (Signed acceptance or delivery certificate 
    has been sent to you.)"</font></p>

    Do you have any information about how this was corrected." <br>
    "General:<br>
    You will recall that the quantity of water at sea inside the visor respectively 
    the height of the water level has always been in dispute between us. Although 
    there are very clear water marks inside visor and outside the (closed) ramp 
    you would not accept this, which we could never understand until you gave 
    us the explanation for your attitude. Your explanation was the gap at the 
    lower port side in way of the securing bolt (which did or could not engage 
    the mating pocket at the ramp side), i.e. there was a small opening of the 
    bow ramp through which water would have penetrated the cardeck much earlier 
    already with serious consequences, which it obviously did not do and therefore 
    the water could not have been as high in the visor as we say. Upon my question 
    where do you know this from, your answer was that the gap was caused by the 
    severely twisted port outer hinges of the bow ramp, which had been stated 
    in the working list several times for repairs but had not been repaired because 
    it is a major item. We have thereafter looked a bit deeper into this and can 
    see on the videos that the hinge was under repair. We have also found the 
    explanation for water in the visor up to the visible marks, i.e. above the 
    gap, and still no water on cardeck (at least not in dangerous quantities, 
    i.e. crew members have plugged the gap each time bow ramp/visor were closed 
    when they had to go down anyway to hammer the bolt of the Atlantic lock closed 
    and at the same time plugged clothing, sheets, rags and the like into the 
    bow ramp gap. You can still see these rags, etc. hanging respectively being 
    pressed in way of the initial gap." The complete letter is attached as Enclosure 
    39.1.466 and its contents have never been disputed by the JAIC.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 8 January 58 pages of 
    the index from the Swedish JAIC's register were received and carefully studied. 
    The non-classified documents of interest, in particular the statements of 
    the survivors, were ordered and subsequently copied and sent to Hamburg by 
    members of the SEA relatives organisation. The statements and other documents 
    arrived in bunches in the course of February and March and were very carefully 
    studied, which took some time since they were in Swedish. Reference will be 
    made to this further turning point in the investigation under the respective 
    month. On the same day the Swedish JAIC plus the Sjöfartsverket observer Sten 
    Andersson met again with S.C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&T who were accompanied 
    by their lawyer. No details of the meeting are known. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">February: In an internal 
    meeting of this 'Group of Experts' it was decided to build a mock-up of the 
    Atlantic lock with as-found welding seams, i.e. 3 mm, and have it pulled to 
    destruction. The JAIC was informed accordingly and it was offered to have 
    the break test performed by VTT or any other institute in the choice of the 
    JAIC. After some time Klaus Rahka - the Finnish metallurgist expert - came 
    back on behalf of the JAIC and declared that the JAIC was happy with the "Institute 
    for Shipbuilding" (Institut für Schiffbau) of the University Hamburg to perform 
    the break test, but that the JAIC would like to attend. The preparations for 
    the tests, to which Klaus Rahka submitted own proposals, commenced and took 
    several weeks. The JAIC Report was now scheduled to be published on 15.06.96. 
    At the same time this 'Group of Experts' started the publication of a request 
    to the Swedish people in the Swedish Text-TV for photos, slides, videos and 
    other documentation/information about the condition and performance of the 
    ESTONIA during her 20 months in service under this name. The request was repeated 
    daily for 6 months and led to several slides, photos and videos, among them 
    the so-called "passenger video" of 19.09.94 which shall be commented under 
    "April" when it was received. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">March: One of the highlights 
    of the month was the publication of the book "Katastrofenkurs" (Catastrophe 
    Course) by Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle. Hellberg was working as journalist 
    for DAGENS NYHETER and had proven on several occasions to have had confidential 
    access to the classified files of the Swedish part of the JAIC while Anders 
    Jörle was then working in the Stockholm office of "GÖTEBORG POSTEN" <br>
    The conclusion of the book written after more than one year of investigation 
    was: <br>
    The sinking of the 'Estonia' had been caused by the failure of the visor hinges 
    which were considerably pre-damaged by faulty and unqualified performed repairs. 
    The catastrophe was programmed and could have had occurred practically at 
    any time. Contributing factors were the facts that the master had not been 
    on the bridge during the decisive last 15-20 minutes and further that the 
    vessel departed from Tallinn with full port ballast water tanks but still 
    had a starboard list. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was, more or less, a 
    confirmation of the tentative casualty scenario and cause consideration of 
    this 'Group of Experts' and in complete contradiction to the JAIC. Stenström

    <br>
    The Break Tests and the FE Analysis of the Visor </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The first break test of a 
    mock-up of the Atlantic lock with 3-mm welds (as-found) between bushings and 
    lugs was carried out by the Institute for Shipbuilding of the University Hamburg 
    in the presence of Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish JAIC. <br>
    The result was the breaking of the big visor lug at a load of about 210 ts, 
    a result which was in total contradiction to the calculations and findings 
    of the JAIC and hectic phone calls between Karppinen/Rahka and Stenström followed. 
    For details of this and the break tests performed subsequently reference is 
    made to Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> 34.3 </a>and <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">34.4.</a> 
    The result of this first break test meant that the break load of an intact 
    Atlantic lock installation on the forepeak deck would have been in excess 
    of 210 ts. As the lugs on the forepeak deck failed at the accident whilst 
    the visor lug held, it follows that the lugs on the forepeak deck of ESTONIA 
    must have had a holding power inferior even to a new lock with only 3 mm welding 
    seams.<br>
    At this time the attention of the JAIC was also drawn to the results of an 
    FE analysis of the visor and the loads on its locking devices which had been 
    performed by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg - see Subchapter<a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.2</a>. The result of this scientific analysis was that as long as the visor 
    hinges were intact the load on the Atlantic lock was only in the range of 
    50-60 ts. - much less than on the side locks - and that the force direction 
    was towards aft and upwards. Only after the visor hinges were broken the load 
    on the Atlantic lock almost tripled and the force direction changed towards 
    forward/upwards, i.e. the mode in which the lugs failed at the accident. All 
    this was submitted in detail and in combination with the detailed break-test 
    results to the JAIC, however without any obvious result. Upon request of the 
    JAIC three further tests were prepared, i.e. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- with a strengthened visor 
    lug to find out the break load of the 3 lugs with 3 mm welds;<br>
    - with tag welds between lugs and bushings;<br>
    - without welds between lugs and bushings; </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Klaus Rahka attended at one 
    further test and he even made written proposals - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.2.466.1.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 39.2.466.</a>1 - the others were left to the "Institute for Shipbuilding". 
    <br>
    In any event, it had been established that an intact Atlantic lock installa-tion 
    with 3-mm welds only failed at a load of 210 ts, and that the visor lug made 
    of mild steel was the weakest point. It was further established by the FE 
    analysis of the visor performed by the TU-Harburg that the load on the Atlantic 
    lock was comparatively small, less than 1/3 of the break load, and that the 
    force direction was aft/upwards as long as the visor hinges were intact. Since 
    the lugs on the forepeak deck, however, broke in a forward/upwards mode at 
    a load below 210 ts, it has to be concluded<br>
    (a) that the visor hinges were already broken when the Atlantic lock failed 
    and, further,<br>
    (b) that the Atlantic lock installation was no more intact, a fact that was 
    confirmed by the investigation of Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister. See <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    34.8.</a></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> All this in combination 
    with the side lock break-tests results by VTT, Helsinki, indicated very clearly 
    that the intact, i.e. as built, locking devices of the visor had by far not 
    been as weak as the JAIC had outlined in their Part-Report and this 'Group 
    of Experts' could correctly demand from the JAIC to correct their load assumptions 
    and conclusions. This, however, was not done in spite of all the contradictory 
    evidence, which could not be better demonstrated than by the fax that the 
    Swedish JAIC administrator Gunnel Göransson did send to the 'STERN' representative 
    in Stockholm in April 1996. It reads - office translated - as follows:<br>
    <i>"I hope you received the DN article, Anders Hellberg, who wrote the article 
    did follow up the commission work already from the beginning and did also 
    write a book which has recently been published. </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here are the answers to 
    your questions: <br>
    1. Why does the Commission disregard the rumours concerning sabotage, dumping 
    of narcotics, the master involved with the Russian Mafia? The damage scenario 
    is so clear. The Commission has examined the visor and knows that all the 
    locking devices, Atlantic lock and side locks were properly closed when the 
    visor broke off. Therefore the rumours that the visor shall have been opened 
    early and that then the locking devices could not have been properly locked 
    again, cannot be true. Furthermore, if they would have had indeed the intention 
    to dump cargo overboard it would have been much more suitable to do it by 
    the stern ramps. <br>
    2. Did 'Estonia' comply with requirements for so-called 'short voyages'? The 
    answer is yes. The law requires that if the vessel proceeds more than 20 nm 
    from the nearest land, there has to be a radio operator onboard and there 
    has to be provision in the lifeboats (food and water). 'Estonia' had this 
    after she flew the Estonian flag and it was valid until the accident. Earlier 
    when 'Estonia' traded between Stockholm and Turku she had an exemption. <br>
    3. Cause of the casualty? <br>
    The commission maintains its opinion as stated in the technical Part-Report, 
    see page 31. a.)<br>
    The locking devices of the visor were constructed with less strength than 
    required according to calculations. Extraordinary heavy weather. The ramp 
    enclosed by the visor construction, etc. The report shall be ready later summer 
    or early autumn. Regards, Gunnel" </font></i></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Subsequently Olof Forssberg 
    was interviewed by "DER STERN" and the resulting article with the heading 
    "Unqualified Rubbish Talks" published in STERN Nr. 18/96 shall be quoted in 
    parts:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "STERN : Witnesses did reportedly 
    hear already shortly after 20.00 hours starting noises on the car deck ... 
    . What explanation does the commission have?<br>
    Forssberg : Of course all sorts of noises were heard. We have heard 135 witnesses 
    (Note: actually they heard 5), however no one heard car noises or did see 
    anything respectively. Furthermore the car deck was control-led by cameras 
    and the pictures were transferred to monitors on the bridge and in the engine 
    room .... . I do not understand that this is taken seriously in Germany.<br>
    STERN : Is it true that certain witnesses' statements have never been properly 
    followed up and that they are now classified? <br>
    Forssberg : During the pending investigation not everything is public. However, 
    when we present our Final Report all the statements will be put on the table. 
    <br>
    STERN : How did the casualty develop according to the Commission?<br>
    Forssberg : ... The combination of weather, waves and speed explains why the 
    visor was torn off. In addition, the construction of the vessel, the connection 
    between visor and bow ramp was not very fortunate, and the locks were not 
    strong enough to master the situation. <br>
    STERN : Is it true that divers were allowed to examine every-thing on the 
    sunken ferry except for the car deck? Is there something hidden? <br>
    Forssberg : In order to be able to enter the car deck difficult burning work 
    is necessary. There was no reason for this. It is irrelevant for our investigation 
    whether there were drugs or cobalt onboard. <br>
    STERN : Isn't it wrong to bury the 'Estonia' under concrete in the light of 
    these speculations before possible new evidence has been secured? <br>
    Forssberg : We have all the information we need. ..." </font></p>

    The STERN questions were answered and the interview was made well after the 
    results of the break tests in Hamburg and Helsinki were known to Forssberg. 
    <br>
    It is also amazing to note that Forssberg states that the JAIC has all information 
    they need while at the same time Stenström, Karppinen and Rahka are preparing 
    a detailed ROV inspection of the vessel and Lethola even considered another

    The Passenger Video </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 April a 90-second video 
    was received which showed the closing of the visor looking down from the open 
    deck 8. After the visor was closed the operator zoomed on the starboard visor 
    hinge for quite a while and the result was shocking. The video showed very 
    clearly and without doubt that the hinge was in an inoperable condition: The 
    outer bushing stuck out, with its lower half missing and the securing plate 
    was gone as well, just to mention a few of the very serious deficiencies demonstrated 
    by this video. The video was taken by a Swedish passenger only 10 days before 
    the last departure of the ESTONIA, i.e. on 17 September 1994. In order to 
    secure this valuable evidence properly and to obtain the most reliable information 
    from it the reconnaissance expert Bryan Roberts was instructed to evaluate 
    the video tape by means of his acknowledged methods and summarize his findings 
    in a report. For details see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    12.5</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.180</a>. Various images were made and one was sent by courier on 4 June 
    to Börje Stenström together with the explanation of what this 'Group of Experts' 
    could see on the images/tape, i.e.: <br>
    - there is a clear gap between the outer hinge plates vessel-/visor-sides 
    which was obviously created by the steel bushing not sticking far enough through 
    the bore, i.e. the larger part of the bushing is at the outer side of the 
    visor hinge plate. - the outer securing plate is missing although 3 bolts 
    can be seen.<br>
    - the lower part at the outer part of the bushing is apparently missing because 
    you can see the end of the visor arm respectively the deck where the bushing 
    respectively the securing plate should be.<br>
    - From the original of this photo, which is slightly clearer than the attached 
    copy, you can also see that the hinge plates at vessel's side are not parallel 
    to those from the visor.<br>
    - Furthermore, at the inner side there is a rust spot where subsequently the 
    upper fracture occurred. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström replied on 
    16 June as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>"1. Starboard side hinge. 
    Have double checked together with Mikael Huss and Hans Öberg that the free 
    ends of the hinge beam side plates are parallel, not converging as the video 
    picture shows. This may influence the virtual position of the hinge bushing. 
    Will look forward to a computer enhanced picture when available." </i><br>
    The Swedish JAIC showed the images sent to them to N&T for comments. The result 
    is unknown. <br>
    In August, during a meeting in Hamburg with the representatives of the relatives' 
    organisations DIS and SEA, Henning Witte and Lennart Berglund, the video tape 
    was shown, without mentioning the date when it was made. After his return 
    to Stockholm Witte informed the press which triggered off some interviews 
    with JAIC members and N&T on which SVENSKA DAGBLADET reported on 31 August 
    as follows: <br>
    "The video film was made by a Swedish passenger when 'Estonia' was in Tallinn 
    harbour. Meyer Werft refuses to say by whom and on which date the film was 
    made, but stated that it was "shortly before the casualty". <br>
    The film shows quite clearly, believes Meyer Werft, that the port hinges of 
    the bow visor had been manipulated. The yard's conclusion is that carrying 
    parts welded together in order that the hinges function better will lead to 
    weakening of the load carrying capacity. <br>
    Shots from the video film are known to the International Commission for more 
    than 1 month and they have received an offer to obtain a copy of the film. 
    This shall be done shortly by the Finnish Commission members, said Olof Forssberg, 
    Chairman of the Swedish part of the International Commission. He refused today 
    to comment on the degree of importance of the picture material as evidence. 
    This will, however, be determined before the substantially delayed Final Report 
    will be published. .......... <br>
    On behalf of the owners N&T the technical manager, Sten-Christer Forsberg, 
    rejected the last play-out of the German yard." <br>
    "This is nothing new or changed, not everything is as obvious as it seems. 
    We have seen the shots from the video which the yard has sent to the Commission 
    and we have replied that these pictures do not prove what the Germans are 
    alleging", said S.C. Forsberg.<br>
    "The pictures are data enlargements and are of the same fantastic quality 
    as the Germans are talking about their own behaviour. We base ourselves only 
    on our own material which confirms that the vessel was 'in good condition' 
    before the casualty", said S.C. Forsberg. <br>
    He also rejected the conclusion of Meyer Werft viz. that there should be no 
    welding at load carrying parts in order to make the hinges of the visor function 
    better. <br>
    "There have been no welding works at the visor hinges. This is furthermore 
    another one in a line of allegations put forward by the Germans. Earlier they 
    had already alleged that the bow visor was opened when the vessel was in Stockholm. 
    But the visor is mainly not opened when the vessel is in Stockholm", said 
    S.C. Forsberg, who characterised the acting of the German yard as "unethical".<br>
    The remarks of the N&T manager shall not be commented, however, the attention 
    of the reader is drawn to the picture on page 292 of this report which shows 
    the ESTONIA at her berth in Stockholm with open visor and open bow ramp.<br>
    On 5 September a copy of the video tape together with the Bryan Roberts report 
    was handed over to the Finnish part of the JAIC in Helsinki. It was viewed 
    jointly with Kari Lethola, Tuomo Karppinen, Klaus Rahka and Kari Larjo and 
    everybody realised and recognised the deficiencies as explained in the report 
    of Bryan Roberts. Subsequently the tape was sent to the Criminal Police Laboratory 
    for examination whether it had been falsified, which it was not. Thereafter 
    a copy was sent to Olof Forssberg of the Swedish JAIC, who informed prosecutor 
    Tomas Lindstrand about the video.<br>
    By letter of 13 September, however, Forssberg sent the tape to the Military 
    Intelligence Service (MUST) - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.467.htm" target="_blank">39.3.467 
    </a>- and asked for data processing and contour strengthenings of certain 
    sequences. <br>
    The MUST reply came on 20 September and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.468.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.3.468. </a><br>
    The "comments on the picture sequence" by MUST reads as follows: <br>
    "Mikael Huss mentioned a 'white line' at the bottom of the visor arm and the 
    right part of the hinge. Upon studying the sequences picture by picture it 
    is visible that this line is connected and sometimes looks broken. We have 
    made 2 examples from each part picture which show these variations. <br>
    Such effect might occur with pictures if the distance between 2 objects is 
    just few frames. Sometimes the objects are melting together and sometimes 
    there appears to be a gap between them. This is due to the digital sensor 
    of the video camera, respectively, how this sensor meets the shadow in each 
    single picture." <br>
    The result is not negative and it is nowhere mentioned that the video tape 
    is not reliable and cannot be interpreted correctly.<br>
    Nevertheless Stenström wrote on 20 September to this 'Group of Experts':<br>
    <i>"Regarding the tourist video picture, we have of course studied the report 
    of Dr. Robert with great interest. Unfortunately it does not come out from 
    his report whether the analysis is based on a computer enhanced picture or 
    purely from work with isolated pictures. Was a computer treated picture ever 
    produced? We have looked at the video tape handed over to our Finnish colleagues 
    two weeks ago and have done so on a screen where the pictures could be fed 
    one by one with retained clarity. In this mode most of the details in the 
    hinge area jump around quite a bit and the starboard hinge bushing is twisted 
    clockwise almost as often as it is twisted anti-clockwise. We are attempting 
    to get a computer processed picture from the copy we have and will study further 
    the possibility of a pre-accident damage to the hinge arrangement."</i> <br>
    On 28 September DAGENS NYHETER published under the heading "The Hinges of 
    the Visor Were Sound" the comment of Olof Forssberg: "The pictures which allegedly 
    show that the visor hinges were maltreated show instead that the hinges were 
    'completely sound'." <br>

    On 21 October Anders Hellberg wrote in DAGENS NYHETER under the heading "Video 
    Film Causes Controversies" and quoted the following comments: <br>
    "Olof Forssberg: <i>"We do not believe that the pictures show anything new, 
    none of them reveal that there was such a damage as alleged by the relatives."</i><br>
    Hellberg went on to say: <i>"Börje Stenström pointed out that the loads during 
    the casualty night affected the port and not the starboard hinges as the yard 
    is now alleging."</i><br>
    Finally he quoted Sten-Christer Forsberg, the technical manager of N&T, who 
    could find nothing serious in the report of the English expert: <br>
    <i>"As far as I understand the judgements of the Swedish defence and the JAIC 
    destroy the basis for the theory of the German yard." </i><br>

    Börje Stenström wrote on 3 November to this 'Group of Experts':<br>
    <i>"Have arranged for a copy of the data processed picture of the deck hinge 
    to be sent to you. This picture is produced by superimposing in a computer 
    program all the still pictures during a time period. In the 'average' picture 
    so obtained the distorsions, which are numerous in any one still picture from 
    a video camera, will be eliminated.<br>
    I am still not certain whether Dr. Robert has used such technique or not in 
    his work. In this cleaned up picture we cannot see any signs of the distorsions 
    that Dr. Roberts is reporting about. <br>
    Am trying to look into the listing of discrepancies you made in the fax but 
    have very little evidence to by. Likewise we have no evidence of any contact 
    accident with a berth of breakwater, certainly nothing that has been reported 
    to the class."</i><br>
    The picture received showed the same as all the other images and the tape 
    itself. It was nevertheless sent to Bryan Roberts for comments, which read 
    as follows:<br>
    <i>"Thank you for your letter of the 12 November and the enclosed print 0:05:17. 
    This is within the bracket of frames I used in my Report. The complete range 
    showing the starboard hinge assembly being 0:05:13 to 0:05:40. These were 
    all used to arrive at the conclusions in my Report. <br>
    The frame 0:05:17 is one of this sequence and, with frame by frame re-examination 
    I can see no reason to change the content of my Report in any way. The change 
    of angle between the visor bolt (annotation 10) and the outer bushing (annotation 
    8) can be clearly seen on images in this sequence and equally well on frame 
    0:05:17, although the quality of the images I used were rather better than 
    this print. <br>
    In assembling my Report I examined all frames on the video tape with any possible 
    relevance to damage or distortion. These were viewed frame by frame on a Sony 
    UP5200 printer/projector which allows visual examination of each frame and 
    printout of selected frames at a chosen degree of enlargement. The ability 
    to scan a sequence allows the comparison of one frame to another and any difference 
    between components of an assembly to be seen." </i><br>
    Bryan Roberts' reply was sent to Stenström by fax of 15 November together 
    with the following remarks:<br>
    <i>"Since you have given your photo together with the report of Bryan Roberts 
    obviously to the press - where else should they have got it from - and bearing 
    in mind your and Olof Forssberg's remarks to Dagens Nyheter published on 21.10.96 
    (copy attached), we will now also give the comments of Bryan Roberts to Anders 
    Hellberg and others." </i><br>
    Stenström's reply came two days later on 17 November: <br>
    <i>"To clarify matters, the picture of the starboard hinge first appeared 
    on Swedish TV in an interview with the lawyer Witte, obviously after he had 
    had a meeting with you. Media naturally demanded comments from the commission 
    and only then did we make our opinion public.<br>
    As to the technicalities, we have also looked at the pictures one by one and, 
    as I have said before, there is considerable jumping around of the contours 
    of the details. The average picture obtained by superimposing all pictures 
    via a computer program then shows the correct shape, better than any isolated 
    picture. Taking the contour of the bottom of the hinge beam as an example, 
    the "mean picture" shows that it stops short of the hinge bolt locking plate. 
    Many of the individual frames show the same thing. To comment only from an 
    individual frame showing the opposite obviously becomes dubious. <br>
    We are at the moment not exploring this matter further." </i><br>
    In other words, the JAIC would completely disregard the evidence contained 
    in this video and that's what they did. It was not mentioned at all in their 
    Final Report. Hellberg, however, wrote again on 25 November, obviously after 
    having spoken to Bryan Roberts: <br>
    "Hinges of 'Estonia' Were Damaged.<br>
    Dispute about video film, British photo expert rejects casualty investigation. 
    By Anders Hellberg <br>
    The 'Estonia' Commission does not believe in the information that the starboard 
    hinge was dangerously damaged when 'Estonia' left Tallinn on the evening of 
    the 27th September 1994. <br>
    In case the Commission had taken another attitude a large part of the blame 
    for the catastrophe would be with N&T, having been respon-sible for the operation 
    of the vessel, and with the classification society Bureau Veritas, who performed 
    the inspections. <br>
    The members and experts of the Commission, however, do not believe that it 
    is possible to draw the same conclusions from the video, taken on board of 
    'Estonia' weeks before the catastrophe, as the English photo analysis expert 
    did.<br>
    <i>- "This is pure nonsense", said one of the members to DN during the meeting 
    the Commission had in Stockholm last week. <br>
    - "The total arm holding the visor is winding like a snake in the film due 
    to unevenness of the video - it is not possible to draw conclusions from such 
    material", said one of the experts. <br>
    - "We do not trust the interpretation of the British photo expert who has 
    been instructed by the German yard",</i> said another member. <br>
    According to the Yard and the British photo interpretation expert Bryan Roberts 
    the bolt, which holds the starboard hinge, is not there and the bushing through 
    which the bolt should go is partly missing. Thereby the whole hinge should 
    have been so dangerously weak-ened that it collapsed in the heavy weather 
    and was also the cause for the visor to fall off. The Swedish experts of the 
    intelligence Service, MUST, state in their short report that there are variations 
    between different pictures of the film and that this should explain, among 
    other things, why the bushing towards the bolt appears to be broken. <br>
    Bryan Roberts said he was astonished by such an attitude: <br>
    <i>"It is obvious that on a number of picture details of the deck can be seen 
    which should not be possible to be seen"</i> - this is a fact which is difficult 
    to get around. There can be no doubt that the bolt of the hinge is missing.<br>
    Roberts, who has long years of experience as a photo interpreter inside the 
    British Military Intelligence Service, said he had used a number of pictures 
    in video sequences and that his expert opinion therefore was not just based 
    on one frame. <br>
    Although the angle to the bushing was changed, it could be seen on a large 
    number of frames on the video. "I cannot understand", said Roberts, <i>"how 
    other experts can come to a conclusion other than mine. I would be pleased 
    to meet them to discuss the matter." </i><br>
    But the Commission consequently cannot trust Roberts without changing their 
    initial opinion stated in the Part-Report from 1st April 1995, viz. that at 
    first the locking devices failed before the hinges broke. According to the 
    opinion of the yard, at first the hinges collapsed due to having been weakened 
    before the locking devices at the bottom of the visor broke." <br>
    Thereafter the video film was not mentioned again in the Swedish media but 
    was brought back to the attention of the public by the Exhibitions held by 
    this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997. See Subchapters 
    40.2 / 40.3. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Rederiaktiebolaget 
    Sally, based in Mariehamn, was at that time one of the major Finnish shipping 
    companies with engagement in tankers and passenger vessels. The company was 
    one of three which together formed the marketing consortium 'Viking Line' 
    for ferry operations between Finland and Sweden (see Subchapter 2.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1986, ownership 
    of the vessel was taken over by the Finnish/Swedish group Effjohn, owners 
    of the competing Silja Line. The vessel continued, however, to operate in 
    the Viking fleet under the original name. The technical operation was subcontracted 
    with the remaining part of the Sally company.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In April 1990 the 
    Effjohn group took over full operation of the vessel and transferred her to 
    Silja Line under the name SILJA STAR for continued operation between Turku 
    and Stockholm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In January 1991 
    the vessel was transferred to the Wasa Line, another subsidiary of the Effjohn 
    group, and was placed in the Wasa Line operation in the Gulf of Bothnia between 
    Vaasa in Finland and Umeå and Sundsvall in Sweden. The ship was then renamed 
    WASA KING. She operated on this route until she was sold to the Estline Marine 
    Company Limited, which is registered in Cyprus.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The

      speed in heavy head seas is not only a question of reduction of stress on 
      vessel's and visor's structure and fixing points, but also the comfort of 
      passengers has to be taken into account. Lars Karlsson made at least 1000 
      cruises and more than 100 times reduced the engine output himself in the 
      engine room when he considered it necessary in heavy weather. He did so 
      for the last times in July 1991 when the vessel was already sailing as WASA 
      KING between Vaasa and Umeå/Sundsvall and consequently the vessel arrived 
      once 11/2 hours late and another time 21/2 hours late.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the vessel 
      was sailing between Turku and Stockholm there had to be two officers and 
      one AB on the bridge. When she was shifted to the Vaasa/Umeå trade the owners 
      wanted to spare one officer, which was accepted by F.B.N. under the condition 
      that the control panel for the indicator lights for visor and bow ramp were 
      moved to the large operation panel in front of the bridge where the lights 
      could be seen from the seats of master and watch-officer. This was done 
      some time in 1991.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck 
      4 cameras were installed prior to delivery in 1980, i.e. one forward towards 
      the forward ramp, two at the sides and one looking aft towards the stern 
      ramp. The cameras could be moved and also had zoom ability. Monitors were 
      on the bridge (located at port side of the entrance to the chart room) and 
      in the ECR above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor 
      could be changed to any other camera, either manually or automatically. 
      The monitors on bridge and in ECR were showing the same picture. The main 
      monitor with operating sticks was in the ECR, i.e. the bridge could not 
      change to another camera nor operate the zoom. Later a further camera was 
      installed at port side of the car deck, but it is unknown where and by whom 
      the pictures were recorded.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Officers and engineers 
      had their accommodation directly in front of the superstructure overlooking 
      the forecastle deck including the visor.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The forepeak was 
      more or less always full in order to keep the vessel on even keel. By means 
      of tank No. 1 the trim of the vessel was adjusted depending on the number 
      of trucks. The trim was mostly 0.5 - 1 m by the stern. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After closing 
      of ramps and visor the hydraulic pumps were always switched off, whereafter 
      a rest pressure remained between cylinders and control lever which slowly 
      decreased within the following 3-4 hours. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Visor and ramps 
      were exclusively operated by the chief officer and the boatswain.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Sea watches were 
      maintained at sea and in port.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Safety rounds 
      were made every 30 minutes on the car deck and below.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inside of 
      the visor was only accessible via the entrance hatch on the forecastle part 
      of the visor. There were no lamps installed inside the visor. </font></li>

  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">THE YEAR 1997 </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC finally managed 
    to complete their Report and publish the English version together with 2 Supplements 
    on 3 December while the Swedish version took another year. Before the publication, 
    however, many things happened which shall be explained in the following Subchapters. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.1 <br>
    The Development until May 1997 </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">January: Due to the illness 
    of Börje Stenström the position of the technical head of the JAIC was apparently 
    taken over by Tuomo Karppinen assisted by Mikael Huss and Klaus Rahka. Karppinen 
    phoned on 17 January and reported the following: <br>
    - They are still making small changes to the report. They had the lugs of 
    the Atlantic lock at VTT and have analysed the paint layers. They found some 
    7-8, grey, white, red, blue paint and are certain now that the lugs were on 
    board for quite some time.<br>
    - They have also spoken to the Turku yard, who stated, never to have painted 
    the forepeak deck area, thus it must have been the crew.<br>
    - Have told him about the change of shape and he said the lugs from board 
    have the same shape as the von Tell drawing and as the mock-up during the 
    break tests, which is correct except that the aft part is vertically cut off. 
    <br>
    - He is unable to give an estimate when their report might be completed, a 
    lot depends on the meeting next week. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Helsinki 
    on 24/25 January and continued to discuss the final version of the Report. 
    The protocol of the previous meeting on 16/17 December in Pårnu was distributed. 
    It reveals that Kari Lethola had spoken to Edelmann/F.B.N. who had told him 
    that there were two persons in the administration, who knew that there was 
    a "problem" with accepting the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead, but that it was common practice to do so. <br>
    This protocol further reveals that Tuomo Karppinen had contact to a Mr. Mäkälainen, 
    who had stated that locking devices had been changed and that Uno Laur had 
    demanded a written statement from this man. The person is unknown to this 
    'Group of Experts' and nothing about him is mentioned in the JAIC Report. 
    This and other protocols finally reveal, that the Sjöfartsverket "observer" 
    Sten Andersson actively participated in the drafting of the Final Report. 
    He was obviously treated as a commission member and apparently did behave 
    like that. Enn Neidre participated also. <br>
    From one of the relative organisations the information was received that the 
    handling of the ESTONIA case by the Swedish Government had been moved away 
    from the Ministry for Communication and Transport (Minister Inez Uzman) to 
    the Ministry of Defence - "Department for Psychological Defence".</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> February: The JAIC met again 
    in Helsinki on 19/20 February. The discussion of the chapters of the final 
    Report was continued and Enn Neidre attended again. On 21 February Tuomo Karppinen 
    phoned again and reported about the results of the meeting:<br>
    - In principle they do agree on the contents of all the chapters - they however 
    have to be proof-read. <br>
    - But they did not agree on the conclusions and recommendations. Therefore 
    they will meet again on 12 March and remain together until everything is agreed. 
    <br>
    - The conclusion will be that one wave impact broke the visor at 01.00 hours. 
    <br>
    - All attachments including the hinges broke a few minutes after 01.00 hours. 
    <br>
    - The first water on the car deck was at 01.10.12. <br>
    - Then it took about 10 minutes for the visor to cut through the deck beams 
    and then the ramp was pulled open.<br>
    - 01.20/22 the main engines stopped, vessel started to drift, starboard side 
    to the wind. <br>
    - Only two passengers have reported water in the 1st deck. <br>
    Note: Actually 9 survivors reported water on the 1st deck, of which two already 
    before the big heel.<br>
    - At 01.30 hours ESTONIA was on the side. <br>
    On 25 February Klaus Rahka reported the following: <br>
    - He wanted the report from the Institute for all the break tests performed 
    (was sent to him). <br>
    - He promised to send a copy of the final findings (which he never did). <br>
    - They ignored the passenger video - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    39.3</a> - because the pictures are jumping too much. It was explained to 
    him that the pictures did not jump on the copy which was jointly viewed in 
    Helsinki, but he was not interested. His attention was drawn to the fact that 
    the starboard hinge bolt was standing without bushing on the rail, which confirmed 
    that the bushing cannot have been complete as otherwise it couldn't have fallen 
    off the bolt and would have remained attached to the bolt as evidently the 
    point bushing did. He was not interested, the decision had already been made 
    jointly. <br>
    - They had come to the conclusion that the load on the visor was about 60 
    ts which was sufficient to break all the locks. <br>
    - He believes that the welding seams of the 1st mock-up had been 5 mm instead 
    of 3 mm. <br>
    - Börje Stenström had now officially resigned from the case. Note: Börje Stenström 
    passed away on 25 February.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> March: On 5 March Tuomo 
    Karppinen faxed page 13 of the Draft Report and requested details about the 
    communication between the yard/ BV/ von Tell, etc. which was complied with 
    by sending the respective chapter of the Report of this 'Group of Experts'. 
    From 12-16 March the JAIC met again to finalize the Report which failed, although 
    - as stated above - it had been the intention to stay together until the last 
    disputes were solved. On 17 March "DAGENS NYHETER" as well as "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" 
    published articles about the internal disputes in the JAIC between Estonia 
    on the one side and Sweden/Finland on the other concerning the behaviour of 
    the crew, respectively how much blame was to be put on the crew. Furthermore, 
    the attention of the public was drawn to the letter Stenström wrote at the 
    beginning of December 1996 to Dr. Holtappels indicating that the JAIC would 
    not point to Meyer Werft having installed the faulty locks by not excluding 
    that the installations could have been changed after the vessel had left the 
    yard. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: At the beginning of 
    this month the stowage plan showing the reconstruction of the condition on 
    the car deck according to the cargo manifest was sent from Hamburg to Helsinki. 
    In exchange, a copy of the KTH-Report about the examination of the hinge material 
    was received.<br>
    During the second half of this month a contact to the Turku Repair Yard was 
    established which resulted after some time in the receipt of very valuable 
    documentation, i.e. the repair-specifications, -quotations and invoices concern-ing 
    the time before, during and after the take-over of the ferry by N&T - see 
    <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.4.</a><br>
    Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 23 April and requested help with regard to <br>
    - the memo on magnetic limit switches (made up by the Estonian JAIC - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.5.172</a>); <br>
    - type of these switches, names/telephone numbers of the electricians having 
    installed them; <br>
    all of which was sent to him. <br>
    In exchange he sent the Leif Bogren and the Hangö statements, which were received 
    the following day. <br>
    He reported further that proof-reading and lay-out of the Report would not 
    be completed before the end of May, i.e. the Report might be printed before 
    midsummer, thus could be published just before the vacation season begins, 
    which the JAIC would prefer. <br>
    At a meeting on 18 April with the Stockholm public relations company H&H the 
    idea was developed to present the findings of this 'Group of Experts' to the 
    Swedish public at an exhibition in Stockholm at the same time when the Report 
    of the JAIC was presented and the media and the public could come to the exhibition 
    and check, compare and discuss the results. This was decided during the following 
    days and the time was set for the week before midsummer, which left two months 
    for preparations.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Tuomo Karppinen phoned 
    on 6 May and stated that <br>
    - they were still proof-reading;<br>
    - they had planned some sort of seminar under the chairmanship of Prof. Rutgersson 
    from KTH in Stockholm where they wanted to present their technical findings 
    to raise the profile of the JAIC, however this can, of course, only be done 
    after the publication of their final report, which will probably be during 
    the week before midsummer. <br>
    On 16 May Karppinen phoned again and told that they were making good progress, 
    about half of the Report was already in the printing house in Helsinki. The 
    day before they had gone through part of the Report with their English language 
    expert. It is most unlikely that they will attend the seminar. It is still 
    under consideration between Kari Lethola, Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg whether 
    this 'Group of Experts' will get the part of their Report dealing with Meyer 
    Werft matters.<br>
    On 20 May journalist Anders Hellberg from DAGENS NYHETER reported that the 
    seminar had been postponed. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.1.1 
    <br>
    The Dismissal of Olof Forssberg</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 26 May the interview 
    quote below by radio journalist Erik Ridderstolpe with Olof Forssberg was 
    broadcasted in Swedish Radio:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Journalist (J), Olof Forssberg 
    (OF)<br>
    "Speaker: The Swedish chairman of the JAIC has lied about a letter concerning 
    important facts about why Estonia and other vessels were built in an incorrect 
    way. Despite the fact that Olof Forssberg has been assigned by the government 
    to lead the commission's work in trying to establish the truth behind the 
    sinking of Estonia, he has repeatedly lied.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> J: So you have never seen 
    this letter?<br>
    OF: No. <br>
    J: Never at all?<br>
    OF: No. It must have been delivered faulty. I will receive a new copy on Monday 
    ... It wasn't today's mail.<br>
    J: Isn't that strange since the letter was sent to you a long time ago. <br>
    OF: These things happen. The post is not always reliable. <br>
    J: So you haven't seen what this letter contains at all? <br>
    OF: No. <br>
    Speaker </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Olof Forssberg 
    is chairman of the JAIC. He is the one responsible for establishing the truth 
    behind the catastrophe. He has already been heavily criticised for his way 
    of handling the investigation. This time the issue is sensitive information 
    about the Sjöfartsverket. It is information that shows that Sjöfartsverket 
    for many years didn't control the placement of the very important collision 
    bulkhead that shall prevent water from entering the car deck in an emergency 
    situation. If Estonia's collision bulkhead had been placed in the right position, 
    the vessel would never have sunk. Olof Forssberg has received and read the 
    letter, but had not registered it. He has deliberately or non-deliberately 
    misplaced the letter. At least one other occasion he has denied that he has 
    received the letter, and he has asked the sender to sent the letter again 
    just so that it would seem as if he had never received it. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">J: But I just can't understand 
    why you are lying?<br>
    OF: I can't understand it either and I must say that I am ashamed over having 
    lied. I have no explanation. I regret that I have been handling the truth 
    carelessly. The reason I have asked you to come here today is partly that 
    I want to explain that I have been lying and also apologise to you.<br>
    J: Is this common behaviour for the chairman of the JAIC?<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> OF: Absolutely not. 
    It goes without saying that the answer to that question is no. <br>
    J: Is this the way you normally handle documents? <br>
    OF: Absolutely not. I always register documents very carefully. Actually I 
    think that the reason for this omission, or rather consequence of, was the 
    fact that the person who handles the Estonia file was on vacation.<br>
    J: How do you think this affects the credibility of the JAIC?<br>
    OF: This is what concerns me most. There have been a few occasions where I 
    not even today can understand why I have acted with such a lack of judgement 
    in certain situations. <br>
    J: The motive behind this is still not quite clear. Why did you lie about 
    the letter? <br>
    OF: ..I...the..hm..I don't think that the motive is unclear. Quite simply 
    this document was received or I read it through and I put it somewhere and 
    then I didn't think anymore about it. <br>
    J: But it is one thing to do that, and quite another to deny the existence 
    of the document. And also you don't have the document here in your office. 
    <br>
    OF: ...n..ne...I...I don't know where it is right now, the letter has now 
    been miscarried but that is not a problem since I have asked the sender to 
    send the same letter once more.<br>
    J. That you did in order to look good and so that you could say that you had 
    now received the letter. <br>
    OF: I have now explained the whole situation to you and I think that, well, 
    that things are as they are." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The subject of the discussion 
    which subsequently turned out to be the reason for the dismissal of Olof Forssberg 
    by Minister Inez Uzman is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.2.3.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.2.3</a>. It is a letter concerning a directors' meeting at Sjöfartsverket 
    dated 07.04.59. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 28 May Tuomo Karppinen 
    phoned and reported the following: <br>
    - Ridderstolpe from Swedish Radio had phoned Forssberg and asked whether he 
    had received a paper from 1959, of which he, Karppinen, also has a copy. Forssberg's 
    answer was no, although he knew that he had the copy but could not find it. 
    He asked Sjöfartsverket to send the letter again which was, however, delayed. 
    So he told Ridderstolpe that he did not have it and never saw it and was subsequently 
    proven to have lied. The first letter was not registered because it was considered 
    unimportant. Ridderstolpe got a tip from somebody inside Sjöfartsverket.<br>
    - General Director of "Statens Havarie Kommission" (SHK) is a full time job. 
    In case the Government should decide to put an outsider in this position, 
    it will take several months and will cause further delay to the publication 
    of the Report. Therefore it has to be assumed that it will be somebody from 
    the Government administration.<br>
    - He has sent two more Chapters to the printing house. <br>
    - They are still of the opinion that it all started with the failure of the 
    visor locking devices on course 287° and full speed, but some within the JAIC 
    believe that it started with the hinges.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Olof Forssberg was dismissed 
    from his position as Chairman of the JAIC on 27 May and replaced by Ann-Louise 
    Eksborg on 16 June. The lady had been working in the legal department of the 
    Ministry of Defence before. Also on the same day Captain Olle Noord, nautical 
    expert up to that time, was appointed member in replacement of Börje Stenström, 
    i.e. now two master mariners were members (Rosengren and Noord). Naval architects 
    were no more present in the JAIC, which, however, did not mean that more emphasis 
    was put on the up to then widely neglected nautical aspects of the case. Olof 
    Forssberg attended for the last time at a working meeting of the Swedish part 
    of the JAIC on 4 June. <br>
    Note: Olof Forssberg was very soon appointed an appeal court judge. One wonders. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b><a name="2"></a>40.2<br>
    The First Exhibition in Stockholm </b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">40.2.1<br>
    Preparations </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The investigation events 
    were summarized in a brochure in English and Swedish languages - the English 
    version is attached as Enclosure 40.2 - which were distributed to the visitors. 
    In further preparation, two exhibition guides were acquainted with the investigation 
    results, these were <br>
    - from Sweden, Captain Erland von Hofsten, 68 years old, retired Stena Line 
    captain and Chairman of the Swedish Sailors Foundation, and <br>
    - from Finland, Captain Peter Jansson, 53 years old, maritime consultant and 
    owner of Oy Mariners Assistance, Porvoo. <br>
    Both spent one week in Hamburg, read through the material, viewed the videos 
    and discussed open questions with this 'Group of Experts'. <br>
    For the exhibition the history of the vessel from newbuilding to sinking was 
    illustrated on big paper sheets. In addition, the topics of the investigation, 
    e.g. the passenger video, the condition of the visor hinges, etc. were illustrated 
    on separate sheets. Furthermore, one of the mock-ups of the Atlantic locks, 
    broken at the break test, a model of the "VIKING SALLY", models of intact 
    and damaged visor hinges, the hinge mock-up with the burning test, numerous 
    drawings and other documentations of interest were shown at the exhibition 
    which took place in the "Gamla Spårvägshallarna" on Birger Jarlsgatan in the 
    centre of Stockholm. <br>
    While the preparations were in progress the chairman of the Swedish JAIC, 
    Olof Forssberg, was dismissed, which triggered off a wave of speculations 
    and, last but not least, caused a new delay of the publication of the JAIC 
    Report. After careful consideration of all circumstances it was decided to 
    continue with the preparations and to open the exhibition - as planned - on 
    Thursday, 12 June, because it was possible by this exhibition to fill the 
    gap which had doubtlessly been created by the new postponement of the publication 
    of the JAIC Report. </font></p>

    <br>
    The Exhibition</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Exhibition was opened 
    on 12 June at 10.00 hours with a presentation for invited guests. Invitations 
    had been sent to the JAIC chairman, members of the Government and of Parliament. 
    About 30 persons of the invited persons appeared, among others: <br>
    - Lennart Berglund/Odd Lundqvist - SEA Relative Organisation <br>
    - Gunnar Benndreus/Henning Witte/Alve Wendt - DIS Relative Organisation<br>
    - Prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand <br>
    - Sjöfartsverket Director Johann Fransson<br>
    - Jörgen Almelöv - Lawyer of N&T <br>
    - Carl Romare - Skuld / Stockholm <br>
    - Lawyers from Skuld / Estline / ESCO <br>
    - one representative of Trygg Hansa - the leading Hull Underwriters of "ESTONIA" 
    <br>
    - Pierre Frey of Bureau Veritas/Paris <br>
    - Bureau Veritas Stockholm - Lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> No one from the JAIC, the 
    Government or the Parliament appeared. <br>
    About 50 journalists attended the following press conference. They came mainly 
    from Sweden, but also from Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Germany. 
    Various TV and radio programs were present with own teams and a considerable 
    number of interviews were made. On the next morning, however, there were only 
    small articles in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and TT NEWS, while TV 1 and TV 4 mentioned 
    the exhibition briefly in their evening news. The question arose why the Swedish 
    media were suddenly so disinterested. Nevertheless the Swedish public, informed 
    about the exhibition by various advertisements, had a different opinion and 
    visited the exhibition in daily growing members while the media remained silent. 
    Only in DAGENS NYHETER on the "Debate" page did one letter from the N&T lawyer, 
    Jörgen Almelöv, appear, which was written in response to the letter of Dr. 
    Holtappels having been published on the same page the day before the exhibition 
    was opened. Among the daily increasing number of visitors were retired captains, 
    pilots, professors from the Royal Technical High Schools in Stockholm and 
    Gothenburg, but also relatives, survivors and previous passengers. Even the 
    master, the chief mate and the chief engineer from "REGINA BALTICA", the ferry 
    having replaced the ESTONIA, visited the exhibition twice and took information 
    material with them. <br>
    The Finnish JAIC chairman Kari Lethola came with two assistants and stayed 
    for 11/2 hours, the investigating public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand came 
    twice with criminal inspector Bo Wide. Both stayed for several hours. Also 
    several employees of Sjöfartsverket appeared and very interesting discussions 
    took place. Most important were the many statements taken from previous passengers, 
    in particular truck drivers, which provided new and more detailed evidence 
    about the disastrous condition of visor and bow ramp including hinges and 
    locking devices, all of which were incorporated into the report of this 'Group 
    of Experts'. See Subchapters <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3 /</a> 
    <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br>
    On the last day the relatives organisation DIS held their press conference 
    inside the exhibition to demonstrate their appreciation for the work of this 
    'Group of Experts' and its preparedness to show the results in Stockholm. 
    <br>
    At the exit of the exhibition a black book had been waiting for entries by 
    visitors about their impressions and feelings after having seen the exhibition 
    and the result was overwhelming as demonstrated by the Swedish original and 
    the English translation attached as Enclosures <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480</a> 
    / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480.1a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480.1.</a> 
    <br>
    On Thursday, 19 June, the day before the Midsummer celebrations would commence, 
    the exhibition was closed after having been open for 7 full days, during which 
    approximately 1200 visitors saw the exhibition.<br>
    In summary it has to be concluded that the exhibition had been a great success, 
    in spite of the silence of the media. The visitors appreciated the opportunity 
    to study the history of the vessel from design/construction to the sinking, 
    the many photos, drawings, the models and mock-up, all of which was explained 
    to them, if they wished so. Many regretted what they thought was a too early 
    closing, however, accepted the reasons, viz. that it would make little sense 
    to kept he exhibition open through Midsummer. Many visitors urged the exhibition 
    guides to request Mr. Bernard Meyer urgently to make sure that the exhibition 
    would be made available again to the Swedish public once the JAIC would finally 
    publish their report. Many visitors demanded a new diving investigation to 
    establish the real truth of the catastrophe. <br>
    It became obvious that the Swedish public and in particular the relatives 
    did realize that this 'Group of Experts' - contrary to all publications and 
    assumptions - really had done their utmost to uncover the real facts and circumstances 
    having led to the catastrophe, and still continues to do so as demonstrated 
    at the exhibition. The message from many relatives and survivors, that it 
    is of utmost importance to them to know, what really happened, was understood 
    and, also, that they felt to be left absolutely alone by their authorities. 
    <br>
    Furthermore, it was realised and accepted that there was serious and convincing 
    evidence available indicating a much better and more logical casualty scenario 
    than that published so far by the JAIC. <br>
    The visitors also understood that a substantial part of the responsibility 
    for the catastrophe was resting with their own Sjöfartsverket and many did 
    express their deep concern about it. The recent resignation of the Swedish 
    JAIC chairman Olof Forssberg in this connection did increase the ill feelings 
    of many visitors.<br>
    Basically it became clear to most visitors that the main blame was resting 
    with the technical managers and part owners N&T, the crew managers and part 
    owners ESCO and the classification society Bureau Veritas. Many visitors were 
    shocked that the ferry in such condition could depart every 2nd day from a 
    Swedish port with 1000 or more Swedes onboard, without any Swedish authority 
    doing anything to prevent it. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Swedish Government, when 
    faced with the facts shown at the exhibition, reacted as follows: <br>
    - The responsible Minister of Communication, Inez Uzman, remained silent and 
    did not attend. <br>
    - The same refers to the members of the Swedish JAIC (only the expert Mikael 
    Huss visited the exhibition in his own time). <br>
    - The only "officials" were Johan Fransson from Sjöfartsverket and prosecutor 
    Tomas Lindstrand. </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here the JAIC describes 
      in detail which inspections were carried out by Port State Control and the 
      surveyor of the Classification Society "in line with common practice and 
      requirements". The JAIC has always known positively that neither the visor 
      nor the forward ramp of the vessel were weather- respectively watertight. 
      (See Subchapter 38.2.) The JAIC was at all times furthermore aware, that 
      the vessel - on the route Tallinn-Stockholm - did not comply with stringent 
      SOLAS requirements with regard to the position of the upper extension of 
      the collision bulkhead above main deck. (See Subchapter 6.5.2.) Such deficiencies 
      render any such vessel unseaworthy without any further debate. If the inspectors 
      appointed by the Swedish government to execute Port State Control or the 
      surveyor of the Classification Society overlook such deficiencies then such 
      behaviour is not considered to be "in line with common practice and requirements" 
      amongst reputable members of the shipping community. It is furthermore noteworthy 
      that the JAIC in this Chapter describes the delivery drydocking in Turku 
      "in 1993" without any mention of the Repair List issued by the former owners 
      and known to the representatives of the new Owners. (See Subchapters 6.5. 
      and 12.5. and Supplement 231 to the JAIC Report). This list - as described 
      in detail in Subchapter 12.5 - contains the root of all the deficiencies, 
      the further worsening of which later led to the catastrophe. Given this 
      fact, hardly any interested reader will consider the following casual remark, 
      which can be found in Chapter 3.3.6., to be a satisfactory description of 
      the problem:<br>
      <i>"Just before transfer to Estonian flag by the end of 1992 attention had 
      been given to the strength of the ramp and visor locking devices and a quotation 
      for reinforcing them had been requested by Wasa Line. However, nothing was 
      made to the locking devices." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">8. JAIC Chapter 
    3.3.5 : </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC states here (page 
      42, middle column): <br>
      "It has been stated that the lower locking bolt on the port side of the 
      ramp sometimes failed to go to fully extended position. The standard procedure 
      was then to retract the bolt and again command it to locked position, whereby 
      it would normally go to fully extended position and the green indicator 
      lamp would come on." <br>
      Evidently the lower port locking bolt of the bow ramp could not engage the 
      mating pocket at the ramp side and consequently also not contact the sensor 
      because the port side of the ramp was misaligned by ca. 21/2 inches = 10 
      cm (diver's statement 2.12.94 - see Subchapters 27 and 29.2) which had the 
      consequence that neither the upper port bolt nor the port ramp (pull-in) 
      hook of the bow ramp were able to engage their respective mating pocket/mating 
      lug. The cause for this severe misalignment was the collapse of the port 
      outer ramp hinge - see Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 - by which the lugs connecting 
      the ramp with the vessel slid off the pin respectively broke. This had been 
      known to the technical managers and the crew since several weeks before 
      the casualty and the crew had - according to Börje Stenström - Enclosure 
      12.5.166 - frequently asked for repairs by putting this item on the repair 
      list. Although these circumstances - as stated above - rendered the ESTONIA 
      unseaworthy they are not mentioned in the Final Report. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">9. JAIC Chapter 
    3.3.6:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here we read: <i><br>
      "After transfer to Estonian flag no more service work was carried out by 
      the MacGregor service base in Turku as the regular maintenance was carried 
      out by the ship's crew and, according to the new owners, no need for external 
      service had developed. New rubber seals had, how ever been ordered. It was 
      known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point where corrective 
      action would be needed." </i><br>
      In this respect reference is made to Subchapters 12.4 and 12.5 where the 
      observations of the many previous passengers are reported. Contrary to the 
      statement of the new Owners, upon which the JAIC apparently relied, many 
      repairs were carried out both to visor and bow ramp parts, partly with heavy 
      burning and welding. There were frequent problems with opening of the locking 
      devices of the visor and/or the bow ramp after arrival in Tallinn which 
      sometimes made it necessary to tow the ferry away from the berth, turn her 
      around and berth her again stern first. This subsequently created very substantial 
      difficulties for the trucks to turn around and leave the car deck.<br>
      As stated by witnesses the lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt 
      off and subsequently rewelded. In this text reference is also made to the 
      divers' report - see Chapters 29.2 and 30 - who stated when inspecting the 
      lugs of the side locks still in the wreck that only a very small piece of 
      (white) visor bulkhead was attached to the lug, otherwise there were only 
      very thick welding seams. Nevertheless there were rectangular holes of the 
      size of the lugs in the visor plating which means that the lugs were since 
      some time before the casualty not welded anymore to the visor plating but 
      only stuck through the existing rectangular holes and then spot-welded from 
      outside and/or inside which explains the extraordinary thick welding seams 
      on the lugs. Thereby it was possible for the crew to adjust the lugs to 
      the changing distance between visor-platings and vessel-platings which increased 
      due to the growing misalignment of the visor. These very obvious deficiencies 
      have apparently not been investigated by the JAIC at all and consequently 
      also not taken into consideration when calculating the remaining load carrying 
      capacity of these lugs. Instead the JAIC based their calculations on newbuilding 
      standard. The JAIC continues further on page 43:<br>
      <i>"Minor routine welding repairs had been carried out on the mating boxes 
      for the ramp locking bolts whilst the ship was in service in the Gulf of 
      Bothnia." </i><br>
      Actually when the vessel was in service between Stockholm and Tallinn the 
      top plates of these mating boxes were frequently burnt off by crew members 
      when they were unable to disengage the bolt after arrival at Tallinn. Subsequently 
      the plates were rewelded. Reportedly this was also done after the last arrival 
      on the morning of 27 September 1994 when the starboard upper mating box 
      had been burnt open but the plate had obviously not been rewelded because 
      the box is still open with no sign of the top plate. See Chapter 29.2. <br>
      <i>"Local welding of a crack in a stiffener underneath the mounting platform 
      for the port side visor actuator has been noted."</i> <br>
      Actually the two lugs by the port visor actuator were found to have been 
      in the following condition:<br>
      - The outer stiffener had been very poorly repair-welded some considerable 
      time before the casualty. <br>
      - The inner stiffener was no more the original one since it did not show 
      any protective coating and it was only spot welded to the deck - if at all. 
      All stiffeners however were fully welded to the deck by the shipyard during 
      newbuilding, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation. 
      <br>
      For details see Chapter 30 - pages 990-1002. The JAIC continues further 
      on the same page: <br>
      <i>"One of the visor hinge pins had, according to verbal information, a 
      tendency to move out of position, breaking away the locking plate. This 
      was repaired once at the Finnboda yard by pushing the hinge pin back in 
      place and drilling for new locking bolts.<br>
      No other repair was, according to available information and extensive search, 
      carried out during the lifetime of the vessel on or in the areas of the 
      various operating and locking devices for the ramp and the visor." </i><br>
      This is wrong for the following reasons: <br>
      - According to the statement of the long-term chief officer Stig Lindström 
      (( January 1996) one of the visor locking devices had to be strengthened 
      some time before the sale - see Enclosure 3.4.101 and in the Swedish JAIC 
      register D11.<br>
      - The JAIC was made aware of several statements of truck drivers that the 
      lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt off and that the ESTONIA berthed 
      sometimes stern first in Tallinn in July, August, September 1994 because 
      visor and/or bow ramp could not be opened upon arrival, but subsequently, 
      after certain repairs could be operated again.<br>
      - Truck drivers have also directly reported to the JAIC that the port side 
      of the bow ramp was severely misaligned, was actually hanging down and could 
      not be properly closed since some time before the casualty.<br>
      - Truck drivers have also reported to the JAIC that securing bolts could 
      not be opened and therefore the top plates of the mating boxes at the ramp 
      were burnt off. <br>
      - Passengers/truck drivers have furthermore directly reported that the ferry 
      after having berthed bow first in Tallinn, was subsequently towed back and 
      turned by tugs and subsequently berthed stern first whereafter the trucks 
      could leave the car deck only with difficulties which reports have made 
      available to the JAIC.<br>
      - The JAIC has in its possession a video film made by a passenger upon departure 
      from Tallinn on 17.09.94 which clearly shows that the starboard visor hinge 
      had been repaired very badly with disastrous effect on the load carrying 
      capacity.<br>
      - The as-found condition of the bushings and hinge plate parts of the starboard 
      visor hinge arrangement confirms the above. <br>
      The JAIC also neglected the old damages in the visor, apparently caused 
      when the ESTONIA was used as an "ice breaker" and was forcing ice barriers 
      several meters high at full speed according to passenger information, which 
      are known to the JAIC. See Chapters 12.4.2 and 30.<br>
      Also the very fresh footprints on the 3rd and 2nd stringers of the visor 
      were not explained in the JAIC Report although the last JAIC chairman, Uno 
      Laur, has stated that they were created by crew members when they went down 
      to hammer open or close the bolt of the Atlantic lock before arrival and 
      after departure from Tallinn. The reason was the impossibility to open/close 
      the bolt hydraulically because the visor was that much misaligned and the 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were that much deformed. See Enclosure 12.5.175.

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Interim Passenger 
      Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) was false. It confirms that the vessel fulfils 
      the SOLAS requirements, which however it did not in respect of the location 
      of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead. On the ESTONIA this was 
      the bow ramp, which was positioned too much forward. Since the Tallinn-Stockholm 
      route - contrary to the Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm route - leads more than 
      20 nm away from the nearest land, no exemption was permissible. The "partial 
      collision door" initially offered by Meyer Werft but rejected by AB Sally 
      against a credit of DM 45.000,00 should have been installed prior to taking 
      up the Stockholm-Tallinn service. This was not done and thus the ferry did 
      not comply with the SOLAS requirements and consequently the PSSC confirming 
      this was false. The JAIC finds it appropriate to explain the failure of 
      Bureau Veritas in the issuance of the false PSSC with words, that stem from 
      Bureau Veritas, namely:<br>
      <i>"When Bureau Veritas surveyed the vessel for change of flag this was 
      done in accordance with the requirements to the extent of a periodic survey, 
      which did not include examination of construction drawings. The location 
      of the extension of the collision bulkhead was thus not considered during 
      this survey."</i><br>
      It is doubtful, whether a periodic survey did suffice (see Subchapter 6.5.2.) 
      and it may also be debated whether inspection of the structure of a passenger 
      ship does not also include a check of the design drawings. The essential 
      point in this case is that Bureau Veritas had accompanied this vessel since 
      its birth and hence perfectly well knew her design. Their own form for the 
      Survey Report as a prerequisite for the issuance of a PSSC demanded the 
      inspector to check the structure of the vessel! (See Subchapter 6.5.2). 
      The same is true for the Load Line Certificate, allegedly issued on 9 September 
      1994, which confirmed that the vessel complied with the requirements of 
      the International Load Line Convention. This the vessel did not for the 
      simple reason, that its hull was not closed watertight against the seas 
      at its bow. Both parts of the double security to ensure this state, namely 
      the visor and the ramp, were not watertight. See Chapters 12.4.3 and 12.5.

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here the following comments 
      seem to be appropriate: At the time of the casualty a new Trim and Stability 
      Booklet was not yet available, but was still in progress, therefore the 
      PSSC and Load Line Certificates were issued only interim and B.V. had to 
      carry out Load Line Surveys every 3 months. In relation to the Trim and 
      Stability Booklet valid at the time of flag change which had been approved 
      by the F.B.N. on 20.01.91 the JAIC states among other things: <br>
      <i>"The Commission has noted that at the inclination test, the ship's centre 
      of gravity was positioned to starboard to such an extent that the port side 
      heeling tank was filled with about 115 t more water than the starboard tank 
      in upright condition. The load cases in the trim and stability manual, however, 
      include the heeling tanks as being either both empty or both full.</i>" 
      <br>
      Such a condition did not exist during the initial inclination test performed 
      in the presence of Gunnar Edelman of the F.B.N. on 21.06.80 in Papenburg 
      and it was unknown what had caused such unfavourable weight distribution 
      101/2 years after delivery. <br>
      Had the JAIC investigated this matter and not left it as mystery, they would 
      probably have found the same answer as this "Group of Experts", namely a 
      hole in the underwater hull which opened a tank or void space to the outside 
      and thereby permitted the creation of unknown weights in the vessel. (See 
      Subchapter 17.1) </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here the JAIC states:<br>
      <i>"On departure from Tallinn on 27 September the ESTONIA was seaworthy 
      and properly manned. There were no outstanding items either from the authorities 
      or from the classification society's surveys. The maintenance standard of 
      the vessel was good as witnessed by various instances." </i><br>
      It has been stated before, that this statement is not only untrue, but that 
      it has also been made with full knowledge of it not containing the truth. 
      This Group of Experts is not the only one to say so.<br>
      Last - but not least - the chairman of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' 
      Association, Captain Christer Lindvall, has frequently condemned the findings 
      of the JAIC. With good reason. <br>
      The JAIC further comments on the "Port State Control" carried out until 
      shortly before the last departure: <br>
      <i>"During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme 
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port 
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on 
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough 
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed 
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise 
      was documen-ted in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. 
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement." </i><br>
      With regard to the inspection and the protocol reference is made to SUBCHAPTERS 
      34.1 and 36.1. Evidently several different versions of this protocol do 
      exist with the knowledge of Sjöfartsverket and the JAIC.<br>
      <i>"The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by 
      the Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and 
      very well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused 
      detention or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular 
      Port State Control." </i>Contrary to the statement the Swedes have actually 
      tried to prevent the departure of the ferry after having detected the many 
      serious deficiencies which are noted in the protocol registered in the files 
      of the Swedish JAIC under A 46 b - see Enclosures 15.200 - see Chapters 
      15 and 36.1. <br>
      The JAIC continues: <br>
      <i>"However, some deficiencies were noted, such as that the rubber seals 
      for the bow visor were worn, had tear marks in some places, and were in 
      need of replacement, and watertight hatch covers on the car deck were open 
      and in a condition indicating that at least one was not normally closed. 
      It was also stated during the interrogation that the Swedish inspectors 
      had experienced "lack of respect for issues related to load line matters" 
      in their contact with officers met during the exercise." </i><br>
      Whichever protocol is the correct one, they all contained deficiencies rated 
      17, which means that they should have been mandatorily remedied before departure. 
      The protocol contained in the Supplement to the JAIC Report (Enclosure 15.200) 
      contains no less than 7 of such deficiencies, none of which was remedied 
      before departure. <br>
      In a telephone conversation after the hearing of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar 
      Zahlée by the Swedish JAIC between Bengt Schager and Åke Sjöblom, the latter 
      did state, that the ESTONIA and her crew were the worst that he had ever 
      experienced. </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The JAIC does not mention 
      the filled void spaces at starboard side due to corroded bottom plates which 
      are most likely the cause for the starboard list. This is hardly a condition 
      that would be described by experts as a <i>"loading condition that was normal 
      for the route"</i>. The contrary is true. A passenger ship with unknown 
      weights of abt. 200 mts leading to an undefined list of abt 10 degrees, 
      which cannot be compensated by filling of the opposite heeling tank is - 
      on this count only - unseaworthy and should under no circumstance be put 
      to sea. <br>
      The JAIC also does not mention that according to eye witnesses from the 
      "SILJA FESTIVAL" the ESTONIA passed the breakwater with half open visor 
      towards the open sea. The respective statement was found in the files of 
      the Finnish JAIC. See Enclosure 19.236 - Chapter 19. </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">14. JAIC Chapter 6.1 : </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC create the impression 
    that they have actively participated in the interrogation of survivors, which 
    was not the case. JAIC members and experts have only questioned one passenger 
    - Pierre Thiger - and some of the crew members, whom they considered to be 
    key witnesses. However, the questioning of a witness simultaneously by six 
    or seven persons can hardly be called an "interrogation". The psychological 
    expert to the Swedish JAIC, who wanted to interrogate all the important witnesses 
    separately, including the passengers, was precluded from doing so by Olof 
    Forssberg, with the exception of the purser Andres Vihmar, whom he questioned 
    alone. The statement is not available. This means that the JAIC questioned 
    the following crew members only: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">3rd engineer Margus Treu<br>
        Motorman Hannes Kadak <br>
        Watch A.B. Silver Linde <br>
        System engineer Henrik Sillaste <br>
        Trainee officer Einar Kukk <br>
        Purser Andres Vihmar (only by Bengt Schager)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> and decided already at 
      a very early stage to rely almost exclusively on the statements of 3rd engineer 
      Margus Treu and A.B. Silver Linde as far as the casualty scenario is concerned. 
      As demonstrated in Subchapter 21.2. the numerous statements of these gentlemen 
      are better evaluated with utmost care and when doing so another consideration 
      should be taken into account. It is a fact well known in the shipping community, 
      that crew members generally tend to be very loyal to their owners and, as 
      a matter of fact, it has been confirmed by Börje Stenström to a member of 
      this 'Group of Experts' that the Swedish and Finnish JAIC members and experts 
      were very much aware, that the Estonian crew members were lying when it 
      came to the most crucial parts of their evidence. Nevertheless the frequently 
      changing statements of Margus Treu and Silver Linde became the essential 
      evidence for the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström one week 
      after the casualty. <br>
      The JAIC goes on to state:<br>
      <i>"Police interrogations in languages other than Swedish have been translated 
      into Swedish and this Summary is based on the Swedish text."</i><br>
      It has been described in Subchapter 36.5 that the statements of Estonian 
      survivors taken in Tallinn in the Estonian or Russian languages had for 
      example not been completely translated into Swedish and that therefore important 
      details were missing. Therefore the summaries of the survivors' statements 
      contained in the JAIC Report are to a certain part based on incomplete translations. 
      It also has to be mentioned that most of the Swedish and Finnish survivors 
      were questioned by policemen not trained to interrogate witnesses of marine 
      casualties. Therefore most important details did not come up in the course 
      of the questionings, because the relevant questions were never asked and 
      thus did not become part of the JAIC investigation and cause consideration 
      at all. Chapter 21 and the numerous statements by survivors as attached 
      to this Report demonstrate the scarcity of the database of the JAIC Report. 
      <br>
      There are indications that the Estonian Commission members as well as the 
      Estonian security police and other government bodies had frequently spoken 
      to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. It is 
      unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings 
      are not available. </font></p>

      in Subchapter 21.2.2 the statements of this crew member are constantly changing 
      to the extent, that this witness must be regarded as excluded from any further 
      consideration of this accident. It can be said with certainty, that<br>
      - Silver Linde had not been on the car deck on his last round;<br>
      - Silver Linde had never seen whether all the control lights for visor/bow 
      ramp were still green, because the control panel was locked and the boatswain 
      had the key; <br>
      - Silver Linde had not been back to the bridge at around 01.00 hours, because 
      he was then already in the crew accommodation; <br>
      - Silver Linde had never been at the Reception to ask for the car deck doors 
      to be opened, because these doors were not locked; <br>
      - Silver Linde had never been on his way down to deck 1 after the starboard 
      heel, because he was then in the crew accommodation area (probably to fetch 
      his relevant personal belongings such as passport, money and the like). 
      All this is revealed from either his own testimony or the testimony of passenger 
      survivors, who were not properly questioned by the police respectively not

      Treu's timing is about 15 minutes late when he states that the heel was 
      about 45° at 01.30 hours, whilst the vessel was actually already on the 
      side according to a number of other witnesses. Nevertheless the JAIC scenario

      In March 1995 he said it was a tarpaulin rolled together. It definitely

      closed bow ramp from the inside such a roll is not visible and also not 
      on the videos/photos showing the car deck opening from the outside with 
      open bow ramp. Since the bow ramp was also known to be partly open at the 
      upper side while in closed condition - see the statement of Carl Övberg 
      - Enclosure 12.4.2.151 - it has to be assumed that this tarpaulin roll was

      that he had not even said so when being interrogated for the first time. 
      Kadak stated that the heel was about 50 degrees when he and Sillaste left 
      the engine control room and that the light went out and came back when they 
      were at the Emergency Exit between decks 5/6 (Sillaste said the same) and 
      further, that the heel was 90 degrees when they reached deck 8. Actually 
      the heel was about 40 degrees when the auxiliary diesels/generators stopped 
      and power disappeared for a short while until the emergency generator started 
      to generate power to a limited number of consumers including all the emergency

      water in cabin and/or alleyways of the 1st deck, 8 were in forward cabins. 
      The JAIC mentions that one passenger saw a "thin trickle of water" in the

      of water under pressure rushing through the corridor. As the JAIC spoke 
      to none of the 1st deck passenger survivors they cannot know better. No 
      doubt, they should have gone deeper into the matter, because water on the 
      1st deck penetrating from the 0-deck below under pressure indicates one 
      or more flooded compartments of the 0-deck. </font></p>

      the visor moving up and down, which he later denied, and that the visor 
      was moving forward/aft and that a transverse gap opened/closed between visor 
      and forecastle deck - a clear indication that the hinges were broken. He 
      further testified that water was gushing out of the gap when the vessel 
      was diving into a wave and that water was surging into the gap when the 
      bow was rising, which makes sense as a moving up and down of the visor is 
      not possible as long as the actuators are connected to B-deck, because the 
      actuators follow the opening movement, however, resist the closing.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It has to be mentioned 
      that the survey vessel "SUUNTA" stayed in Hangö during the 28th when the 
      weather was relatively bad and the wind speed was 16/18 m/s. On the 29th 
      and the 30th the wind speed was just 12 m/s, however, "SUUNTA" departed 
      only on 30th at 08.40 hours from her berth to the casualty position, which 
      was, of course, known by the Utö and the "MARIELLA" radar observations. 
      She commenced the search at 16.27 hours and found the wreck at 17.32 hours 
      on 59°22,92'N; 21°41,06'E, which is the actual wreck position. She dropped 
      a buoy and returned at 18.45 hours to Hangö. <br>
      Consequently the real position of the wreck was known to the Finnish authorities 
      from the very beginning, and with certainty also to Kari Lethola. Nevertheless, 
      he reported 59°23,0'N; 41°43'E by fax to Olof Forssberg on the same evening 
      and, furthermore, Sjöfartsverket took up in their tender specification for 
      the diving investigation sent out to various contractors in Northern Europe 
      a wreck position which is 2100 m to the NNE of the actual one.<br>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Report does not state 
      that the diving survey described here was not the first ordered by the Swedish 
      Government. The JAIC furthermore just spends a few lines on this major operation 
      carried out by very professional contractors on behalf of Sjöfartsverket. 
      The evaluation of the video tapes presented to this Group of Experts show 
      that this operation was conducted simultaneously with another diving investigation 
      by other divers. Since it has to be excluded that this second operation 
      could be carried out without the divers and the operators and supervisors 
      on board of the diving support vessel "SEMI I" noting it, it has to be concluded 
      that this other diving operation was also performed with the approval of 
      or by Swedish governmental authorities. It is noteworthy, that no tapes 
      or written documentation of this second operation have ever been released 
      by the Swedish authorities to the public. They are however available. It 
      has further to be mentioned that the Finns obviously tried to hide the presence 
      of Tuomo Karppinen onboard - see Chapter 27 - the reason probably being 
      the attempt to leave the responsibility for the many obvious mistakes made 
      with Börje Stenström being the only "official" participant on behalf of 
      the JAIC. <br>
      These mistakes were:<br>
      - the failure to instruct the divers to search the bridge properly for bodies 
      and identify the bodies by means of their uniforms (or not wearing uniforms 
      at all);<br>
      - the failure to have the front bulkheads, the longitudinal bulkheads and 
      the recesses on both sides of the bow ramp, the locking devices of the bow 
      ramp and the ramp hooks examined properly by the divers; <br>
      - the failure to have recovered at least the port visor hinge bolt with 
      bushing, the lugs of the visor side locks and the whole bow ramp with hinges, 
      just to mention the most important items;<br>
      - the failure to have examined by the divers why the starboard stern ramp 
      was open;<br>
      - the failure to have the starboard side of the wreck above the mudline 
      including the starboard stabiliser video filmed and properly recorded; <br>
      In summary it has to be concluded that the wreck examination by the JAIC 
      was carried out very poorly and insufficiently which is also reflected in 
      the description of the damage to the wreck in the following chapters.</font></p>

      area is allegedly summarised in the drawing 8.1 on page 120. This is misleading. 
      <br>
      The drawing does not show<br>
      - the damages mentioned above, i.e. the cracked off starboard front bulkhead 
      and the large holes in the longitudinal bulkheads; <br>
      - the missing and damaged rubber packing of visor and bow ramp; <br>
      - the cracked off outer starboard girder of the bow ramp, just to mention 
      a few examples, instead <br>
      - pounding damage is indicated where is no such damage; <br>
      - the port outer and inner hinges of the bow ramp are indicated to have 
      failed, which they did but some time before the casualty; <br>
      - "deep indentations" are just indicated at the lower part of the bow ramp, 
      i.e. in way of the contact area with the forepeak deck, in case the ramp 
      should have been fully open, although all transverse girders up to the flaps 
      are very heavily distorted in way of the centre line.<br>
      In summary the JAIC again indicates existing or non-existing damage the 
      way it fits their casualty scenario. Missing rubber packings, cracked open 
      bulkheads and distorted, cracked off girders, which obviously cannot have 
      been caused during the hypothetical casualty scenario of the JAIC are either 
      not mentioned or misinterpreted. <br>
      Some details: <br>
      - The JAIC states that the visor parking devices (harbour securing) were 
      undamaged, but do not state that they were open (this means that there had 
      to be "one red light" on the control panel when it was allegedly checked 
      be Silver Linde - see Chapter 21.2.2.). <br>
      - The JAIC states that "the opening in the front bulkhead on the port side 
      had rather clean cut contours", which is true, however the JAIC does not 
      state that the starboard front bulkhead was completely ripped open from 
      the inside to the outside, that a green painted deck piece is sticking in 
      the opening and that the starboard side corresponding to the photo at Fig. 
      8.2 is just a big black hole of the size that the diver could crawl into 
      it. <br>
      - The mounting bracket for the locking-bolt position sensors, in short the 
      sensor plate of the Atlantic lock, was found to be empty with corroded screw 
      holes indicating that the sensors had been dis-connected some time before 
      the casualty; <br>
      - The sensor cables were clearly cut - not torn - all of which is not mentioned 
      in the JAIC Report. Moreover the sensor plate as well as the cables had 
      been cut off by the divers in December 1994 and thrown away to the sea bottom, 
      thus disappeared forever, under the eyes of Stenström. There was indeed 
      substantial damage to the rubber seals and flatbar housings in the "corner 
      of the mouth", however not or rather limited to the forepeak deck. <br>
      - Pounding damage was noted in way of the stempost area, but only to a very 
      limited extent to the edges of the forepeak deck. <br>
      - The bulbous bow does not only show scratch marks, but 3 partly deep indentations 
      indicating very heavy contact because the bulbous bow is a very strong structure.

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">30. JAIC Chapter 8.5.3 - 
    Visor Damage :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> At first the JAIC describes 
      the big indentation in the starboard shell plating of the visor in a misleading 
      way creating the impression that it was only one indentation, although there 
      are actually two, i.e. the upper part is of older and different characteristics 
      and the lower larger part is extending into the older upper part as can 
      be seen in Figure 8.5. The JAIC uses repeatedly the term "pounding" when 
      describing the damage to the visor bottom and alleged damage to the edges 
      of the forepeak deck, although the visor bottom is severely distorted and 
      pressed in which occurred obviously when the visor had moved that wide forward 
      that the stempost area was extending the forepeak deck and thus had lost 
      its carrying function. As a result the forepeak deck was pressed into the 
      visor bottom with the visible result. The only "pounding" which actually 
      occurred was within the play of the locking devices. This had created the 
      low banging noises heard by many passengers before the casualty on this 
      voyage and also already on previous voyages. <br>
      On pages 122/123 of the JAIC Report the visor and parts of it are shown 
      on 7 photos (Figure 8.4 - 8.10) in a very particular way. <br>
      Fig. 8.4 shows the visor looking from aft to forward and starboard to port. 
      The picture shows the damage to the port inner longitudinal bulkhead and 
      the deep indenta-tion on the port side of the upper cross beam. Both damages 
      can be seen in more detail on Figure 8.7. What is not shown is the opposite 
      port side: There is absolutely no damage, i.e. the starboard inner longitudinal 
      bulkhead does not even show scratches in the paint and the port side of 
      the upper crossbeam just shows paint scratches. The explanation for this 
      damage being restricted to the port inside of the visor is the apparent 
      fact that the vessel was considerably heeled to starboard when the lugs 
      underneath the visor arms (visor lugs) broke through the front bulkheads 
      of the vessel and did not support the visor any longer against moving to 
      starboard. The visor fell for about 100 mm to starboard until the port inner 
      bulkhead of the visor was resting on the bow ramp then lying inside the 
      visor already on the vertical and crossbeams. This impact caused the up 
      to 360 mm deep indentation on the port inner bulkhead of the visor. There 
      is corresponding damage in way of the port upper side of the bow ramp - 
      see Chapters 29, 30, 31 (Casualty Scenario). <br>
      Figure 8.7 also shows the port inside of the ramp house with the last two 
      of nine frames of the aft part of the ramp house bent. That is to say that 
      actually only the last frame (P4) at port side was pressed together while 
      the next one (P3) is only slightly indented, the next one (P2) even less 
      and P1 just shows a slight contact mark and the remaining frames towards 
      the starboard side are unaffected. See pages 955 ff. in Chapter 30. <br>
      Figure 8.9 does not show the starboard side (outside) of the port, but of 
      the starboard actuator attachment lug (visor lug) with deep scorings and 
      green (deck) paint marks indicating frequent forward/aft movements of the 
      visor when the visor was tilted down by different angles. The JAIC does 
      not show pictures of the inside (port side) of this starboard lug and also 
      not from inside and outside of the port visor lug, thereby depriving the 
      reader of the possibility to draw conclusions from the conditions of these 
      lug plates as to movements and tilting angles of the visor. The respective 
      pictures are shown in Chapter 30 on pages 973 and 996. It reveals that both 
      the outsides and insides are deeply scored at starboard side, though differently, 
      i.e. much more and deeper at the outside and at the inside only one main 
      scoring line almost parallel to the forecastle deck. <br>
      At port the outside of the visor lug plates is totally unaffected, i.e. 
      not even paint scorings, while the inside is very deeply scored, almost 
      engraved indicating forward/aft movement of the visor at varying tilting 
      angles. <br>
      The obvious fact that the starboard outside and the port inside of the lug 
      plates were most severely scored leads to the conclusion that the vessel 
      was already heavily heeled to starboard when the hinges broke, first at 
      starboard and subsequently at port, because the obvious fact that the port 
      outer lug plate is not scored at all indicates that the vessel must have 
      been heeled to starboard already quite considerably when the port hinges 
      broke because there was no contact between the lug plate and the deck/deck 
      beam. <br>
      Figure 8.8 shows damage below the recess for the port locating horn which 
      was obviously caused by the port locating horn at a time when the port hinges 
      were broken already, because the visor was in raised condition as otherwise 
      the locating horn would be resting deeper and higher in the recess as confirmed 
      by the contact marks at both sides of the recess. <br>
      Figure 8.10 shows the big visor lug being part of the Atlantic lock installation. 
      It shows the bore to be elongated, but it cannot be seen that the hole lug 
      is bent to starboard, it almost cracked off the visor bottom, obviously 
      when the visor moved the above explained ca. 100 mm to starboard, a very 
      strong indication that the Atlantic lock was at that time still intact. 
      The JAIC picture also does not show the flame cut-off part of the lug with 
      two deeply penetrating cracks having started in one of the burning marks. 
      For details see page 1028. <br>
      Figure 8.11 shows a rather foggy picture of the port outer bow ramp hinge 
      (the JAIC has crystal clear pictures in particular from this area) which 
      is again described in a misleading way. The lines allegedly point to "rags" 
      are actually pointing at a thick blue mattress at the upper side and the 
      bed-cloth at the right which were put there by the crew as "sealing" material 
      because there was a gap of some centimetres between bow ramp and bulkhead 
      in this area since the hinge had failed several months before the casualty. 
      The bolt is visible in a declined condition much too far to starboard. The 
      brown lug visible at the upside slipped off the bolt several months before 
      the casualty where after the other one broke. The JAIC is wrong when stating 
      that the aft deck plating of the visor had heavy pounding marks. Just in 
      the recesses at the port and starboard side there are some contact marks, 
      otherwise there are no indications of pounding in way of the deck plating.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>31. JAIC Chapter 8.5.4 
      - Ramp Damage </b>corresponds to Chapter 29.2, item 6. <br>
      The JAIC writes: <br>
      <i>"The condition of the ramp was inspected primarily from its lower side 
      due to the limited access to the upper side." </i><br>
      This is wrong. The ramp was accessible at the upper side as well as the 
      lower side, from the inside and from the outside. The divers went everywhere 
      - even inside, i.e. the car deck side - and everything is on video. <br>
      The JAIC writes:<i> "The 2 port side hinges at the bottom the ramp were 
      torn apart"</i>, thereby creating the impression that this occurred during 
      the casualty. This is wrong. The heavy port hinge should have been renewed 
      already in January 1993 according to the specification of the last Finnish 
      crew of the vessel. See Subchapters 3.4/6.5.1. This was ignored by the new 
      technical managers N&T and nothing was done. As time went by the bolt of 
      the port outer hinge worked itself more and more to starboard, broke the 
      securing plate and, finally, the outer lug connecting the ramp to the vessel 
      via this hinge bolt, slipped off the bolt which caused the failure of the 
      inner lug as well. The ramp was no more connected to the vessel at the port 
      outside, a gap of some 20-30 mm occurred which increased. See memo about 
      the discussion with Stenström in October 1995 - Enclosure 12.5.166. The 
      car deck was open to the at sea always water-filled visor. According to 
      Stenström the damage was frequently put on the repair list, however, repairs 
      were rejected by N&T. It is unknown when the port inner hinge of the bow 
      ramp broke, however according to the damage picture it might well have been 
      sometime before the casualty. The two starboard hinges of the bow ramp are 
      just elongated. <br>
      The JAIC writes: <i>"Both hydraulic actuators for the ramp had failed in 
      their piston rod end eyes, i.e. at the ramp attachments points."</i> That 
      is correct, however, the starboard piston rod broke twice, once in the eye 
      and another time between eye and piston. <br>
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The actuators were in partly extended position as 
      when the ramp is partly open."</i> This is wrong. The starboard actuator 
      is not visible at all. Its opening in way of the recess of the starboard 
      front bulkhead is almost covered by the bow ramp resting on the recess and 
      what is visible is torn and deformed. The JAIC fails to mention that the 
      starboard landing of the bow ramp to which the attachment points were fitted 
      was completely torn open (inside to outside) and severely distorted. The 
      port actuator is visible inside its housing in slightly open condition. 
      On one video it is completely inside the housing, on another one it is slightly 
      extending to the outside - see pages 836, 837. Apparently the divers did 
      change the condition of this actuator. Also inside this housing an angle 
      iron is visible which obviously had been pressed into the bulkhead plating 
      in way of the lower side of the opening. See Chapter 29.2 - item 6 - pages 
      832, ff. <br>
      The JAIC writes that the<i> "wires preventing the ramp from falling down 
      to the forepeak deck had detached from the lugs on both sides of the ramp"</i>. 
      That is true, both ramp lugs are intact and without wires, which are however 
      both still connected to the attachment points at the upper car deck opening. 
      The starboard wire is full length visible to the intact lug with shackle 
      and bolt attached. The bolt is apparently intact and screwed into the shackle 
      which raises the question who did unshackle the wire from the ramp lug and 
      screwed the bolt again into the shackle? Needless to say that all this is, 
      of course, not mentioned in the JAIC Report. <br>
      The JAIC:<i> "The ramp port side beam was damaged in several places, mostly 
      towards the top end"</i>. Meant is probably the port outer vertical girder, 
      which is only slightly damaged at its bottom part between the lower and 
      the next upper transverse girders. It is also possible that the JAIC means 
      the damage at the port upside, outside of the ramp which was caused when 
      the visor was resting on this part of the ramp. <br>
      The JAIC: <i>"The lugs for the pull-in hooks were twisted."</i> Actually 
      both lugs are intact, i.e. not broken, but heavily bent away from the location 
      of the pull-in hook and on the ROV video from 09.10.94 there are two wooden 
      pallets visible which jammed in between the bulkhead recess and the bow 
      ramp in way of the landing of the lug for the pull-in hook. On the diver 
      videos from December 1994 these pallets were no more at this location, which 
      means that the bow ramp must have been opened and closed. <br>
      The JAIC continues:<i> "The hooks themselves could not be inspected closely." 
      </i>This is wrong. The port hook arrangement including actuator is fully 
      visible on the available videos and was also checked by the diver Dave Mawston: 
      <i>"There is a latching mechanism." </i>The port hook is in its initial 
      position and intact which means that it cannot have been engaged before 
      the casualty respectively if it was engaged upon departure Tallinn it must 
      have been opened at sea before or during the casualty. The starboard hook 
      is not in its initial position, where it should be is a big black hole. 
      <br>
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The boxes on the ramp side bars, mating the bolts 
      of the ramp side cleats were twisted to open position except for the lower 
      port side one." </i>This is wrong: None of these mating boxes were twisted 
      to open position, i.e. the port upper one was completely intact but just 
      slightly bent upwards, the port lower one was completely intact with a rope 
      wound around it, the starboard upper one was intact with the upside missing 
      (had been burnt off upon arrival in the morning of 27 September 1994 by 
      flame cutting when the crew was again unable to disengage this securing 
      bolt). Obviously there had been no time to re-weld the cut off part to the 
      box before the last departure. See also chapter 12.5. Finally the starboard 
      lower box was completely smashed together in a way that the bolt was unable 
      to enter the box. This damage was apparently caused earlier when the ramp 
      had been closed when the bolt was already extended. <br>
      In addition attention has to be drawn to the reports of diver Dave Mawston 
      when checking the ramp. He found that the extended bolts at the port side 
      of the ramp were about 21/2 inches = ca. 100 mm below the respective mating 
      boxes, i.e. none of the port side bolts could anyway have engaged their 
      mating boxes and this is apparently also the reason why the port pull-in 
      hook had not engaged its mating lug. All this was obviously due to the very 
      severe misalignment of the whole ramp and its disastrous consequence - nothing 
      of it is mentioned by the JAIC. </font></p>

      and the locking bolt were removed from the wreck during the diving operation 
      for close investigation." </i>The locking bolt was brought up by the divers 
      but thrown back into the sea by Stenström, thus it could never be<i> "closely 
      investigated"</i>. Nevertheless the JAIC writes: "Only a slight variation 
      in diameter was measured at the contact area between the bolt and the visor 
      lug. No other damage to the bolt was noted." <br>
      This is wrong. Although the bolt is not available for close examination 
      the following can be concluded from the quite good video footage:<br>
      - there were two contact areas indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully 
      closed, sometimes only partly; <br>
      - the vertical steel bracket fitted to the bolt was bent to port and showed 
      heavy hammering marks at its edges; <br>
      - the two lugs, between which the piston rod was connected to the bolt by 
      pin, were bent outwards, i.e. away from each other, and also showed heavy 
      hammering marks. <br>
      The reason for these damages were the problems the crew had with closing 
      and opening the bolt which did not function any more hydraulically since 
      some months before the casualty because the lugs were severely deformed.

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">35. JAIC Chapter 8.6.4 - 
    The Visor Actuating Arrangements :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The explanations of the 
      JAIC concerning the failure of the port actuator foundation, called bottom 
      mounting platform, is confusing and partly wrong. The initial construction 
      and the damage picture of the foundation is explained in detail and illustrated 
      by several photos on pages 990 ff. of this Report. The summary reads as 
      follows: <br>
      <i>"(1) The outer stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old 
      temporary repair with very poor welding seams in its forward part. Due to 
      the corrosion visible on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this 
      improper repair was carried out already some considerable time before the 
      casualty. <br>
      (1) The stiffeners show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward 
      and the aft ends of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonable assumed 
      that the stiffeners were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. 
      The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty 
      due to load changes during the opening and closing of the visor. <br>
      (2) The B-deck was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the 
      stiffeners. This fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck 
      remains. <br>
      (3) The port inner stiffener was no more the original one since firstly 
      it did not show any protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded 
      to the deck -if at all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the 
      deck by the shipyard during new-building, as it can still be seen on the 
      starboard actuator foundation. <br>
      (4) The load carrying capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably 
      reduced." </i><br>
      The JAIC explanations about the failure of the starboard actuator is accepted, 
      however except for the following remarks by the JAIC: <br>
      <i>"The lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams showed 
      indentations and scoring on the forward and starboard side faces (Figure 
      8.9). The sealing arrangement around the deck openings for the actuators, 
      consisting of rubber seals supported by steel flat bars, was compressed 
      over most of the surface and some paint marks showed that the hinge arms 
      had been in limited contact with the deck plating." </i><br>
      The <i>"lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams" </i>were 
      called <i>"actuator attachment lugs" </i>in the previous Chapter 8.5.3 and 
      were actually the pair of lugs underneath the port and starboard visor arms 
      (called visor deck beams by the JAIC) by means of which the actuators were 
      connected to the visor. The condition of the lug plates, i.e. starboard 
      outside: deeply scored, starboard inside: slightly scored: port outside: 
      no contact marks at all: port inside: very deep scorings; has been explained 
      and commented under Chapter 8.5.3 above and needs not be repeated. <br>
      The JAIC is also wrong when stating that <i>"the rubber seals supported 
      by steel flat bars (around the deck openings for the actuators) were compressed 
      over most of the surface" </i>because this is the case only at port side 
      where the rubber seals were indeed distorted apparently by rubbing. See 
      pages 996 ff. The starboard side rubber seals are, however, unaffected. 
      See pages 973 ff. The forward parts of the port and starboard lug plates 
      show contact marks without paint at their upper parts, which were apparently 
      caused when the lug plates were cutting through the forecastle deck plating. 
      Below these areas there is more or less unaffected or just slightly affected 
      white/red paint at starboard side all the way down, but at port side there 
      are further contact areas without paint. <br>
      Bearing in mind the strong deck beam at frame 159 which the lugs at both 
      sides reached after only 120 mm of 8 mm forecastle deck plating were easily 
      cut through and which was evidently cut through at both sides, it is difficult 
      to believe that this was performed by the above explained foreparts of the 
      two starboard and two port lugs. Calculations revealed - see Chapter 34.12 
      - that weight and forward momentum of the water-filled visor were theoretically 
      able to cut the deck beam, however the damage picture of the cutting tools 
      - the lug plates, and in particular, the starboard ones, do not confirm 
      this. <br>
      This problem has been closely examined by The Independent Fact Group, Stockholm, 
      who more or less proved that the lugs could not have cut the deck beam, 
      however, do not offer a reasonable solution but leave that to a new investigation.<br>
      As to the starboard side the possible explanation is outlined in Chapter 
      32 - Unexplained Evidence - because there are several indications that a 
      powerful explosion occurred also inside the void space above B-deck, which 
      blew open the front bulkhead and possibly also destroyed the deck beam in 
      question before the hinges broke. <br>
      At the port side, however, there are no such indications. Here the answer 
      might be that the deck beam was cut by the piston rod of the partly extended 
      actuator. The piston rod is made of high tensile steel. See Figure 8.25 
      in the JAIC Report. <br>
      Finally the remark of the JAIC that<i> "some paint marks showed that the 
      hinge arms (now the "visor deck beams" are called "hinge arms" to confuse 
      the reader even more) had been in limited contact with the deck plating"</i> 
      has to be totally rejected because not even the primer is affected.<br>
      Note: This "contact" between the undersides of the visor arms and the forepeak 
      deck in front of the deck openings for the actuators has been one of the 
      strongest arguments in favour of the JAIC casualty scenario presented in 
      the Part-Report published already early April 1995. The argumentation of 
      Stenström then was that "as soon as the visor bottom was compressed deeply 
      enough due to repeated up/down pounding of the visor the underside of the 
      visor arms did rest on the forepeak deck and due to the leverage created 
      the hinges broke". This was proven to be wrong and the above is the rest 
      of this line of argumentation and even that is wrong. </font></p>

  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">CHAPTER 42</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> FINDINGS</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">This Chapter is purposely 
    written in the same order as the corresponding Chapter 20 in the Report of 
    the JAIC in order to facilitate an easy comparison for the reader. Where no 
    corresponding remarks are found, this 'Group of Experts' either agrees or 
    has not investigated the specific subject. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Accident </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">- The car/passenger ferry 
    ESTONIA sank during the early hours of 28 September 1994 in the Northern Baltic 
    on its voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm. According to the official figures 
    only 137 passengers and crew members survived. The wreck lies in international 
    waters. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Weather / Sea state </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - At the time of the casualty 
    the wind was blowing from SW-ly directions with a speed of 18-20 m/sec. The 
    significant wave height was about 4 metres. Neither wind speed nor sea state 
    were exceptional for the season. <br>
    - Before the sequence-of-events of the casualty commenced the ESTONIA was 
    pitching extremely hard in bow seas from port forward due to a speed which 
    must be considered excessive under the prevailing conditions.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Ship's Condition</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - When the ferry left Tallinn 
    she was unseaworthy for the following reasons: Her bow was open to the sea. 
    The bow visor and the bow ramp, which should both be water(weather)tight, 
    were leaking with the consequence that seawater had uncontrolled access to 
    the car deck, a condition which must be avoided by all means, as it severely 
    endangers the safety of the vessel and it's passengers.<br>
    A part of the underwater hull was corroded to the extent, that seawater had 
    free access to certain tanks and void spaces. The consequence of this fact 
    was, that about 200 mts of unknown weights were in the vessel creating a 10 
    degrees list which could only be partly rectified by the ballasting of the 
    port heeling tank.<br>
    The vessel's Passengership Safety Certificate was false, the same is true 
    for her Load Line Certificate. <br>
    Trucks and cars on the car deck were not properly secured although the upcoming 
    heavy weather was known to the master. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Sequence-of-events </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - Due to missing rubber 
    seals and damage to it's bottom the visor became quickly filled at sea up 
    to the outside water level with seawater, which penetrated through the partly 
    open bow ramp into the car deck.<br>
    - The existing starboard list was increased by the wind pressure from port. 
    <br>
    - The vessel therefore heeled 2 to 4 degrees to starboard and the water that 
    had penetrated through the bow ramp accumulated on starboard aft of the car 
    deck as the vessel was trimmed by the stern at the commencement of the voyage. 
    <br>
    - There are indications that the crew opened the starboard stern ramp slightly 
    in an attempt to drain the car deck thereby.<br>
    - The bilge pumps were running and pumping from compartments of the 1st and/or 
    0-decks. It has to be assumed that the watertight doors in the engine room 
    area were closed, whilst the watertight doors in the passenger area of the 
    1st deck were still open after the big heel.<br>
    - At about 00.40 / 00.45 hours heavy metallic bangs were heard and felt from 
    the foreship and the movements of the vessel changed to softer pitching and 
    rolling. The metallic bangs continued. It has to be assumed that the starboard 
    hinges and side locks of the visor failed at about this time. The visor was 
    now moving forward/aft between the hinge parts on the forecastle deck and 
    the deck beam at frame 159.<br>
    - The speed was reduced and the damaged bow turned to starboard away from 
    the waves, however when the vessel started to roll excessively the bow was 
    turned back to port and wind and sea were now taken from straight ahead. The 
    vessel now made soft, deep pitch movements for a while.<br>
    - At some time later also the port hinges and the port side lock failed, whilst 
    the Atlantic lock held somewhat longer. <br>
    - At about 01.00 hours the vessel was shaken heavily and noises and vibrations 
    as if the vessel was proceeding through ice were heard and felt by those on 
    the 1st deck, shortly followed by another, even more severe impact, followed 
    by a very wide heel of the vessel to starboard at 01.02 hours The vessel, 
    however, came back to almost upright condition, heeled again, came back to 
    10-15 degrees starboard heel and subsequently heeled in steps to about 30-35 
    degrees to starboard and stabilized in this condition for some time. <br>
    - While the visor moved forward/aft and the lugs underneath the visor arms 
    were slowly cutting trough the deck beam of frame 159, both bow ramp actuators 
    broke and the unsecured ramp fell into the visor. <br>
    - After some time the lugs underneath the visor arms had worked their way 
    through the deck beam - most likely first at the port side - and the visor 
    now also moved to starboard following the increasing starboard heel and fell 
    onto the bow ramp which rested in the visor.<br>
    - In the meantime the forepeak deck had penetrated the bottom structure of 
    the visor whilst the shell plating edges were overlapping the forepeak deck.<br>
    - The visor was now held by the bow ramp and by the port side plates overlapping 
    the forepeak deck, whilst the vessel continued to heel to starboard and the 
    stern sank deeper.</font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Capsize </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- The main engines stopped 
    at about 01.10 / 01.12 hours at a heel of 25-30 degrees. At this time the 
    vessel had turned to a North-Easterly heading. <br>
    - The vessel stabilized at a heel of 30-40 degrees for some time and the diesel 
    generators stopped at about 01.15 / 01.20 hours whereafter the emergency generators 
    started and supplied power to a limited number of consumers.<br>
    - The vessel continued to heel and was on the side at 01.30 hours and some 
    time later completely upside down whilst the stern continued to sink deeper 
    and the bow to raise higher. <br>
    - It has to be assumed that the visor did glide off the bow ramp and forepeak 
    deck when the heel had reached some 130-140 degrees and sank to the bottom 
    of the sea as it was unable to float. <br>
    - The stern finally settled on the sea bottom with the bow still raised to 
    about 40-45 degrees out of the water. The bow ramp was almost closed. <br>
    - The bow sank slowly deeper and -<br>
    at 01.53 hours the echo of the ESTONIA disappeared from the radar screen of 
    the nearest vessel "MARIELLA". </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Action by the Crew</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Nothing can be stated 
    with some degree of probability from the bridge for the time after 00.35 hours.<br>
    - It has to be assumed that a first "Mayday" was transmitted at around 00.45 
    hours, which for unknown reasons was not picked up. <br>
    - It has further to be assumed that after the problems with the bow ramp and 
    visor were realised, the speed was reduced and attempts were made to take 
    the loads off the visor. <br>
    - It is likely that the crew worked on the car deck attempting to hold the 
    visor and the bow ramp to the vessel by different means. This attempt, however, 
    failed. <br>
    - There are also indications that the engine crew was working on the starboard 
    stabiliser. All attempts of the crew were apparently abandoned at about 01.00 
    hours. <br>
    - A warning for the passengers "Alarm, Alarm" was shouted in Estonian language 
    a few times over the loudspeakers. No other information was given to the passengers. 
    </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Technical Matters </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- At the time when the ESTONIA 
    was designed and built, there were no specific design requirements for visors 
    in the rules of the Classification Society Bureau Veritas. The SOLAS Convention 
    at that time was not yet part of the B.V. Rules. <br>
    - The Finnish Board of Navigation considered itself exempted from the inspection 
    of structural matters in newbuildings - such as locking devices - by the Copenhagen 
    Convention of 1924 and hence had to rely on authorised Classification Societies 
    for plan approval and inspection of structural matters on newbuildings. B.V. 
    was authorised.<br>
    - The visor design load and the assumed load distribution on the attachments 
    was in accordance with L R. Rules and the then state-of-the-art and technique.<br>
    - The visor locking devices installed by Meyer Werft, were manufactured in 
    accordance with the design and good shipbuilding practice. These devices were 
    not identical to those found onboard after the casualty. <br>
    - The SOLAS requirements for the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck were never complied with. Nevertheless Passenger Ship 
    Safety Certificates were issued by The Finnish Board of Navigation and - after 
    the vessel had changed it's flag - by B.V. on behalf of the Estonian National 
    Maritime Board. It may be debated wether the issuance of these certificates 
    during the time the vessel spent under Finnish flag was completely in line 
    with the requirements of SOLAS but that debate is irrelevant, because any 
    such failure cannot have contributed to the Catastrophe. <br>
    - The Load Line requirements for a tight vessel were not complied with on 
    9.9.1994 although BV confirmed the Load Line Certificate on this date, i.e. 
    19 days before the casualty, on behalf of the Estonian National Maritime Board. 
    <br>
    - The general maintenance standard of visor and bow ramp was unacceptable 
    which fact was the main cause for the casualty. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b> CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>1.</b> The vessel was 
    designed in accordance with the state of the Art and the Rules and Regulations 
    applicable at the time of design and building by one of the shipyards most 
    experienced in the building of such type of ships, which had just completed 
    a Near-Sister-Vessel. (See Chapters <a href="underfinnishflag.htm" target="_blank">2.1</a>, 
    <a href="2.2.htm" target="_blank">2.2</a>, <a href="2.3.htm" target="_blank">2.3,</a> 
    <a href="2.4.1.htm" target="_blank">2.4.1</a> and <a href="2.4.2.htm">2.4.2.</a>and 
    <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a> JAIC) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>2.</b> The vessel was 
    constructed in accordance with the state of the Art, the approved design and 
    under the supervision of a very experienced and competent Class-surveyor. 
    (See Chapters <a href="2.4.2.htm" target="_blank">2.4.2,</a> <a href="2.4.3.htm" target="_blank">2.4.3,</a> 
    <a href="2.4.5.htm" target="_blank">2.4.5</a>, <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">2.4.6 
    </a>and <a href="2.6.1-2.htm" target="_blank">2.6</a>. JAIC maintains, that 
    the building yard did not adhere to it's own design criteria (Chapter 15 JAIC).This 
    conclusion however is based on the wrong assumption, that the welding seams 
    found on the wreck were laid during the construction of the vessel. (See Chapters 
    <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">3.3</a>, <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, 
    <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>.) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>3.</b> The procedure chosen 
    by the Finnish Board of Navigation (FBN) in the issuance of Passengership 
    Safety Certificates whilst the vessel was under it's jurisdiction did not 
    completely comply with the SOLAS Regulations in force at that time, but this 
    failure of FBN did not contribute to the accident. (See Chapters <a href="2.4.4.htm" target="_blank">2.4.4</a> 
    and <a href="6.5.2.htm" target="_blank">6.5.2</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>4. </b>Whilst being owned 
    and managed by her previous Finnish owners (Sally and Silja) the vessel was 
    reasonably well maintained. Design or construction defects were not noted, 
    although the vessel cruised for twelve years in the Baltic Sea. At the time 
    of delivery of the vessel to her new Owners, she had deficiencies, which were 
    however quite normal for a ship of her age and in her trade. These deficiencies 
    were reported by the staff on board to Silja, the then managers of the vessel. 
    This report became known to the new managers, being Nordström & Thulin, who 
    however chose not to take note. These deficiencies then developed fast to 
    the worse and into a substantial contributing cause of the accident. (See 
    Chapters <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">3.4</a> and <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5.1</a>) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>5. </b>Acting as mandatory 
    of the Estonian National Maritime Board (ENMB), Bureau Veritas on 7.2.1993 
    issued an Interim Passengership Safety Certificate for MV ESTONIA. This was 
    done in obvious violation of the relevant Regulations of SOLAS. Had the responsible 
    inspector of Bureau Veritas complied with his duties and refused the issuance 
    of a Passengership Safety Certificate, the new Owners would have been forced 
    to install the extension of the collision bulkhead above main deck and had 
    this been done, the vessel would - with all probability - have survived, despite 
    of all her other deficiencies. (See Chapters<a href="6.4.htm" target="_blank"> 
    6.4</a>, <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5 </a>and 9.1)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>6.</b> At Sea the vessel 
    was operated recklessly in ice and during bad weather, which caused a further 
    worsening of the deficiencies taken over with the vessel and added new ones, 
    the most outstanding of which was, that the visor was pushed out of its geometry, 
    vibrated and was constantly filled with water to the outside water level at 
    sea. No attempt was made to rectify these deficiencies. It has to be assumed, 
    that the responsible staff at Nordström & Thulin was aware of these further 
    deficiencies as well. (See Chapters <a href="chapter12.htm" target="_blank">12.1</a> 
    to <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.6,</a> <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a> 
    and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>7.</b> The most crucial 
    deficiency developed in 1994: The port outer hinge of the bow ramp became 
    twisted, could consequently not be secured properly anymore and lost it's 
    watertightness. Ever since water from the filled visor flowed into the car 
    deck at sea, despite the efforts of the crew to prevent the ingress of water 
    by plugging the gaps with linen and mattresses. As the watertightness of the 
    bow ramp - when deemed to be the extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    main deck - is a mandatory condition of SOLAS, the Rules of Bureau Veritas 
    and the Load Line Convention, MV ESTONIA had lost it's class notation and 
    it's seaworthiness, when being traded with an untight bow ramp. (See Chapters 
    <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3</a>, <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4</a>, 
    <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a> 
    and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>8.</b> It is common knowledge 
    with the Owners or Operators of Ro-Ro Passengerships, that water on the car 
    deck must under any and all circumstances be avoided as it unavoidably lessens 
    the stability of the vessel, being the vital safety criterion of each passengership. 
    It has to be assumed, that the responsible staff at Nordström & Thulin was 
    aware of the loss of watertightness of the bow ramp and the consequential 
    ingress of water onto the car deck from the water-filled visor. No attempt 
    was made however to rectify this unacceptable condition. (See Chapter <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>9.</b> It should have 
    been detected at least by those whose duty it was, to control safe operation 
    of Passengerships trading between Estonia and Sweden for the benefit of their 
    passengers. This refers especially to the inspections conducted by the inspector 
    of Bureau Veritas - also acting as mandatory of ENMB - shortly before the 
    casualty and - especially - the inspection of MV ESTONIA on the day before 
    the casualty by leading personnel of Sjöfartsinspectionen (SHIPINSPEC) and 
    ENMB. During this inspection the most serious deficiencies at the bow area 
    were found and noted, but - although the vessel could have been stopped by 
    order of the Estonian members of ENMB in Tallinn or by refusal to permit entry 
    into Swedish waters or ports through the leading personnel of Sjöfartsverket 
    - nothing was done. (See Chapters<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> 9.1</a>,<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> 
    9.3, </a><a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">15 
    </a>and <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>10. </b>There were further 
    grave deficiencies in the vessel, when she left for her last voyage:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> I. Due to fatigue cracks 
      caused by the vibrations of the visor and unqualified repair work the hinges 
      of the visor had lost nearly all of their design strength. (See Chapters 
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a>, 
      <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>, <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">34.8 
      </a>and <a href="34.9.htm" target="_blank">34.9</a>) <br>
      II. The stempost of the visor had been cracked four times due to fatigue 
      caused by the vibration of the visor. Consequently it could not support 
      the weight of the visor anymore. The visor did instead rest on the forepeak 
      deck which fact caused misalignment of the visor and all its locking- and 
      holding devices far exceeding the permissible tolerances. (See Chapters 
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) 
      <br>
      III. The vessel left port with a starboard list, which was caused by uncontrolled 
      water ingress into the vessel through a hole in the shell plating. (See 
      Chapter <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.1</a>) The cargo in the 
      vessel was not lashed according to regulations despite knowledge of vessel's 
      command of the coming heavy weather. (See Chapters <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.2</a>, 
      <a href="chapter18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>11.</b> The grave deficiencies 
    described in 5, 7 and 10 above rendered the vessel unseaworthy. When she left 
    the port of Tallinn, she was not permitted to carry passengers, cargo or crew 
    under all relevant international or Estonian national regulations. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>12.</b> The vessel was 
    run on full engine power in very rough seas up and until the casualty. This 
    fact constitutes a gross violation of the principles of good seamanship and 
    shows disrespect for the comfort of the passengers. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) 
    Had the vessel been in a seaworthy condition however, such facts would not 
    have mattered, as they did not over the past 14,5 years of her trade in the 
    Baltic Sea. Under conditions as given on the night of the 28th of September 
    1994 this excessive speed started the known deficiencies to interlink and 
    thereby the chain of causes to unravel which led irreversibly to the foundering 
    of MV ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>13. </b>This 'Group of 
    Experts' has used all efforts and possibilities available to it to investigate 
    the actual casualty scenario. All available crew members and survivors were 
    interrogated by members of this 'Group of Experts' or by experts instructed 
    by it. (See Chapters <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a> and <a href="chapter21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>) 
    Substantial evidence unknown so far was collected. (See Chapters <a href="chapter22.htm" target="_blank">22</a> 
    to <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) The Group purposely refrained 
    from taking refuge to hypothetical assumptions in it's attempt to establish 
    the casualty scenario but rather made it their point to seek the truth based 
    on facts only. Only evidence confirmed by other facts was considered permissible 
    evidence in the establishment of the casualty scenario by this 'Group of Experts'. 
    The result of these efforts is the casualty scenario described in Chapter 
    31. It demonstrates that the vessel was already in a crucial situation, which 
    should have prompted immediate return at 20.45 hours at which time it was 
    still under coastal shelter. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) 
    That occasion having been missed the vessel was doomed to death as the water 
    ingress into the car deck constantly increased until it finally became overwhelming.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>14. </b>When scrutinizing 
    the underwater videos made available to this 'Group of Experts' by JAIC astonishing 
    facts were discovered. Although these facts do not contribute to the task 
    of the Group, the most important of them shall be reported here briefly: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">I. The underside of the 
      port bridge wing had apparently been torn open, when the vessel was already 
      resting on the seabed. (See Chapters <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> 
      and<a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank"> 34.6</a>) <br>
      II. Divers of the "official" teams took time to search for, find and salvage 
      a certain suitcase belonging to a gentleman with the reputation of being 
      engaged in the smuggling of weapons. (Chapter<a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank"> 
      27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br>
      III. There is evidence, that there has been movement of the bow ramp, when 
      the vessel was already resting on the seabed. (See Chapter <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br>
      IV. There is evidence, that other than the "official" diving teams were 
      in the vessel, especially in the car deck. (See Chapters <a href="chapter25.htm" target="_blank">25.1</a>, 
      <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)It 
      has to be assumed that the other divers had entered the wreck with the knowledge 
      and permission of Swedish Government Authorities. No records of their activities 
      are available. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">After thorough investigation 
    of some of the underwater videos a world renowned expert came to the conclusion, 
    that explosions had occurred on MV ESTONIA's bow. (See Chapters <a href="chapter32.htm" target="_blank">32.1</a>, 
    <a href="chapter7.htm" target="_blank">7</a> and<a href="34.7.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.7.1</a>) These conclusions have not been taken into consideration when 
    establishing the casualty scenario. The sole reason was, that these conclusions 
    have to be seen in conjunction with the repeated reports about a "big hole 
    on the starboard side" (See Chapter <a href="chapter36.htm" target="_blank">36.3</a>). 
    Whether there were explosions can only be established with certainty by metallurgical 
    examination of the metal affected from the wreck and whether there actually 
    is a big hole on the starboard side can only - but easily - be established 
    with certainty, if and when the Swedish authorities release the underwater 
    video tapes taken of the wreck by different diving teams in their original 
    version i.e. without any tapering therewith. Only after such further investigations 
    have been held, is it possible for anybody to establish the true causes for 
    the foundering of MV ESTONIA. </font></p>

    4 </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="4"><b>A SHIP EMANATING 
    FROM THE BALTIC PHENOMENON</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The attached 
    report - made up by ADC Support AB, Stockholm on request of the JAIC - contains 
    a historical overview of the ferry traffic between Finland and Sweden with 
    the rapidly growing number of passengers as well as of cars/trucks and the 
    rapidly growing ferries. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The VIKING SALLY, 
    designed and constructed to cope with this fast development - called "The 
    Baltic Phenomenon" - was considered the trend-setter when she took up service 
    in the early 1980's with Viking Line. The effect of competition between the 
    two main operators in these trades, i.e. Silja and Viking, on the design and 
    construction of the ever growing ferries, and even on the safety philosophy 
    of the two operators, is clearly outlined. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the development 
    between 1959 and 1993 of the visor with ramp house construction - called "garage" 
    in the report - in comparison to other visor constructions and bow doors on 
    Silja and Viking Line ferries was examined in the report. The result is that 
    Silja commissioned 25 ferries during these 34 years, of which 7 were fitted 
    with a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the FINLANDIA and 
    SILJA REGINA commissioned in 1981. Viking Line did bring 41 ferries into service, 
    of which 27 had a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the OLYMPIA 
    in 1986 (sailing in P&O charter as PRIDE OF BILBAO between Southampton and 
    Bilbao/Spain since her sale) and ALANDFÅRJAN in 1987. This demonstrates that 
    it was absolutely common in those years, and in conformity with the state-of-the-art, 
    to apply this construction - bow ramp extending into a ramp house which was 
    part of the visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report further 
    discusses the safety culture existing for decades within the Silja and Viking 
    organisations and on the basis of which the "ships" navigation and operation 
    at sea was not considered to be a main "risk factor" as the long-term experience 
    had proved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The collective record 
    of Silja and Viking Lines from 1960 to 1995 is five killed passengers on 107 
    million passenger single trips, i.e. one casualty per almost 18 million single 
    trips. Moreover, these 5 passengers were killed in one collision in a narrow 
    fairway. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to ESTONIA's crew 
    recruited exclusively from ESCO staff, the author indicates by means of comparison 
    between the power/breadth ratios of the Silja/Viking ferries in 1993, which 
    was between 700-1000 kW/m and the ESCO vessels at the same time, which was 
    between 100-300 kW/m except for GEORG OTTS being 600 kW/m, that the ESTONIA 
    crew might not have had sufficient experience to handle the vessel competently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report has been 
    prepared by the Naval Architect Hans Wermelin, thus from the point of view 
    of a naval architect based on his knowledge at the end of 1995.Consequently 
    it ends with the following remarks:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »This overview with 
    the explanations of the work with safety is contrasting to the Estonia catastrophe. 
    The reason is that until this happened the design philosophy was that big 
    volumes of water should not enter into cargo deck when the ship was properly 
    closed at sea. When the catastrophe showed this was a false philosophy an 
    intensive work started to make these ships safe regardless of water on cargo 
    deck. In fact this work was already started after the catastrophe with the 
    Herald of Free Enterprise. Thus the latest purposely built ships in the trade 
    manage to carry a lot of water on the cargo deck: M/S Silja Symphony and M/S 
    Silja Serenade manage one meter and M/S Silja Europa has to sink before she 
    capsizes.«</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="4"><b> CHAPTER 5</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nordström & Thulin 
    AB is a Stockholm-based public company, established in 1850, with extensive 
    experience in the worldwide operation of large modern tankers and bulk carriers. 
    Also passenger ferry operations between the Swedish mainland and the island 
    of Gotland in the Baltic Sea belonged to the business and shipbroking is another 
    important company activity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of 
    the changes in the Soviet Union in 1988 the Board of Nordström & Thulin (N&T) 
    decided to investigate the possibilities for a car/ passenger service between 
    Stockholm and Tallinn and in early spring 1989 Hans Laidwa, a born Estonian, 
    took up his work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Laidwa's business 
    was to investigate the possibilities of opening a ferry traffic between Stockholm 
    and Tallinn. N&T's plans had a positive response in Stockholm and Tallinn, 
    but the decisions - as far as Estonia was concerned - at that time were still 
    being made in Moscow. The Soviet authorities would among other things have 
    to tolerate that passengers on short cruises to Tallinn would not need visas, 
    which was finally accepted.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T received the 
    exclusive right for the passenger traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm from 
    the Estonian side for a guaranteed period of 10 years. This was necessary 
    for the long-term planning of investments, because N&T had to take care of 
    all investments in vessels, in terminals and project preparations and also 
    to conduct the ferry line with own personnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For the new activities 
    N&T formed the company N&T Estline AB, and appointed Hans Laidwa its managing 
    director. The Danish passenger ferry MV DANA REGINA, which for many years 
    had been employed in the traffic between Copenhagen and Oslo, was purchased, 
    renamed NORD ESTONIA and put under Swedish flag. The ferry left Stockholm 
    on 16 June 1990 on her historical first tour and a very euphoric summer was 
    commenced. The picture of the city of Tallinn was changing and many of the 
    Soviet restrictions were breaking down through the influence of the numerous 
    tourists visiting the city. The first song festival after 50 years took place 
    without approval from Moscow and it was the first time in 50 years that people 
    from all over Estonia could meet friends and relatives from other parts of

    harder political signals which culminated in the bloody events in Vilnius

    and to fight for their independence. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Already in October 
      1992 the formalities to buy the WASA KING ex VIKING SALLY were finalised 
      and the decision made, to operate the vessel under Estonian flag with Estonian 
      crew. Since the Estonian Ships Register was not accepted by the mortgagee 
      banks, the vessel had to be registered with one of the acknowledged Ships 
      Registers and Cyprus was selected. To permit an additional entry in the 
      Estonian Bareboat Register - condition to fly the Estonian flag and to employ 
      Estonian crew - the structure of owning/operating/ managing companies as 
      below stated was created.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> MV ESTONIA was 
      owned by the Cyprus company Estline Marine Company Ltd. The shares of this 
      company were owned 50% by Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) and 50% by Nordthulin 
      Luxembourg S.A., which is a wholly owned daughter company of Nordström & 
      Thulin AB (N&T), Stockholm, whilst ESCO was owned by the Estonian Government. 
      The vessel was registered in Cyprus with permission for parallel registry 
      in Estonia on the basis of a bareboat charter party. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason for 
      the vessel being registered in Cyprus was - as said before - the demand 
      of the mortgagee, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), 
      that the vessel had to be entered in a register with mortgage security acceptable 
      to the bank, which was not the case with the Estonian register. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was 
      chartered by Estline Marine Company Ltd. to the Estonian company E-Line 
      Ltd. (E-Line) on basis of a bareboat charter party. E-Line is owned 50% 
      each by ESCO and Nordthulin Luxembourg.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">MV ESTONIA was 
      then registered in the Estonian bareboat register and therefore had the 
      right and obligation to sail under Estonian flag and with Estonian crew. 
      </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bareboat charter 
      agreement provided - as is usual - that the vessel was let without crew 
      and that the bareboat charterer was responsible for crewing and all other 
      obligations of a ship-owning company.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bareboat charterer 
      E-Line contracted ESCO on the basis of a Ship Management Contract to provide 
      the crews and to take care of technical maintenance/operations as well as 
      insurance. The reason for this was that ESCO was a Tallinn based, state-owned 
      stock company. Its history dates back to 1879, when the first shipping company 
      Linda was established in Estonia. ESCO operated worldwide a variety of cargo 
      vessels of up to 50,000 dwt. ESCO also operated passenger ferries in the 
      Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Finland. In the autumn of 1994 the company 
      owned and operated 55 vessels and thus had considerable better possibilities 
      than E-Line in dealing with crew matters, such as employment, quality control, 
      education/training and follow-up.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> ESCO for their 
      part left the technical maintenance/operation on the basis of a respective 
      subcontract to N&T, allegedly being more competent and experienced in respect 
      of larger passenger ferries than ESCO and also having better connections 
      to suppliers of equipment and spare parts, etc. Also insurance matters and 
      administration were left to N&T having more experience than ESCO with the 
      international insurance of vessels. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On basis of an 
      agency agreement, E-Line also subcontracted the commercial activities (sale 
      of tickets and freight, hotel - restaurant activities on board, terminal 
      activities, etc.) to the Swedish company ESTLINE AB, which was owned 50/50 
      by ESCO and N&T. </font></p>

  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of Estline 
      AB's Estonian sister companies, Estonian Ferry Services Ltd. (EFS), had 
      the responsibility for the sale of tickets and freight in Estonia as well

      Swedish side.</font></p>

      they would be prepared to perform, in addition to their obligations as Classification

      then head of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm inspection office, Ulf Beijner, 
      however, also B.V. was uncertain about the requirements to be performed 
      by the Maritime Administration of the new flag state in case of a large 
      and almost 13 year old car/passenger ferry like ESTONIA. Therefore Sjöfartsverket 
      was asked to render assistance during the take-over inspections at Turku 
      and Tallinn, perform the "operative control" and whatever else might be 
      required as a consequence of the flag change.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It will be explained 
      in the subsequent subchapter that Sjöfartsverket complied with this request 
      against respective payments and a rather close co-operation between the 
      otherwise totally different organisations N&T, B.V./ E.N.M.B and Sjöfartsverket 
      in connection with the take-over and flag change of the ESTONIA commenced.

      selection and employment of officers and ratings was performed by ESCO, 
      who had to supply vessel's crew according to the management contract with 
      E-Line. ESCO was responsible for competence control and for vessel-specific 
      education. The N&T organisation took an active part through Sten-Christer 
      Forsberg and Ulf Hobro in selecting the masters, chief officers and chief 
      engineers. In addition to requiring formal and practical competence and 
      qualification, N&T also required that the top people should also be able 
      to communicate in English, and in particular, that the respective masters 
      and chief officers had experience with passenger ferries / Ro-Ro traffic.<br>
      M.V. ESTONIA was taken over from her previous owners at the shipyard in 
      Turku, there the Estonian crew took possession of the vessel, the on board 
      organisation was established and the necessary work to adjust the vessel 
      to Estline's traffic was carried out. Finnish speaking personnel from the 
      previous owners Wasa Line (chief officer, 1st engineer, electrician, and 
      2 repairmen) were hired from the start of the new traffic for between 21/2 
      and 5 months to assist their Estonian successors with practical advice in 
      dealing with the vessel's specific systems. This principle was always followed 
      by the Operations Organisation of N&T when taking over vessels, independently 
      of flag or nationality of crew. <br>
      One of N&T's ferry-experienced masters, Anders Andersson, assisted N&T's 
      organisation in preparation work for about 2 months before the vessel was 
      taken over and stayed on board the vessel for the first 51/2 months. His 
      main task was to give practical advice to the Estonian master in respect 
      of navigation in the Stockholm archipelago and manoeuvring in port, but 
      also in respect of cargo and stowage planning, and other traffic related 
      questions.« </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible superintendent 
    from Nordström & Thulin, Ulf Hobro, was interviewed by the criminal police 
    Stockholm on 22.11.94 when he testified as quoted below:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      participated in the selection of master and chief engineer for the ESTONIA.

      in passenger traffic between Tallinn and Helsinki. Also the chief engineer 
      had worked on board vessels routed between Tallinn and Helsinki. <b>The 
      crew was, according to Mr. Hobro, as good as a Swedish crew</b>.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Naturally those responsible 
    for the education, selection and training of the crew must have - at least 
    externally - a good opinion of those whom they have selected, which, however, 
    is by no means shared by all the insiders. Actually Captain Andresson had 
    been master onboard GEORG OTTS for 8 months, chief officer for 10 months and 
    2nd officer for 10 months, i.e. in total 28 months. Bearing in mind that two 
    crews relieved each other every 2 weeks, the time onboard is only 50%, i.e. 
    14 months and certainly not many years, as Hobro told the police.</font></p>

  The first - and last - master and his adviser</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The first 
    master of the ESTONIA was selected by ESCO, and apparently also by N&T, to 
    be Arvo Andresson, the second captain for the first two months was the elderly 
    Captain Rain Erlach, of whom nothing is known. He was replaced by Avo Piht 
    who relieved Arvo Andresson in two-week intervals until the last voyage, when 
    he was on board, but not in command, and who has been considered "missing" 
    ever since. The first - and at the beginning only - "nautical adviser" was 
    Anders Andersson, a well qualified and experienced Swedish ferry master. The 
    reason for his employment was:</font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">N&T wanted to know 
    what was going on onboard; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">at first, none of 
    the Estonian masters, Andresson and Piht, had pilot licenses, thus they had 
    to take a state pilot in the Stockholm archipelago, but in addition one holder 
    of a pilot license had to be on board and that was the nautical adviser;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the Estonians were 
    inexperienced in almost every respect, i.e. loading and securing of trucks, 
    ballasting the tanks accordingly, safety matters, nautical matters, etc. </font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After several months 
    increasing tension developed between Andersson and the Estonian officers, 
    in particular, Arvo Andresson, who became known for knowing everything better. 
    Andersson was consequently replaced by Juri Aavik (did not survive) and Karl 
    Karell (now nautical superintendent of N&T). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The situation 
    and the atmosphere on board during the first months in service can probably 
    best be demonstrated by an extract from the book <b>"Katastrofen Kurs"</b> 
    by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg. Anders Hellberg, who spoke in length 
    with Anders Andersson, reports as a result of this discussion in Chapter 11 
    of the book:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Arrogant, nonchalant 
      and not very competent <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arvo 
      Andresson, Master of "Estonia", was in many respects an extraordinary master. 
      He took care that discipline and order on board were properly upheld. However, 
      he had a little problem: He mixed up port and starboard. He, as well as 
      his relief Avo Piht, were described as little Gods on board. Under the old 
      Russian system, of which practically the entire crew was a product, the 
      master's word or orders were never questioned. In particular during his 
      absence this could become quite serious. On board a vessel certain things 
      have to be carried out immediately in order not to endanger the safety. 
      But if the master was not present and could not be asked, the result could 
      be that nothing at all was done. It was better to do nothing instead of 
      doing something which could cause the master to see red. Such a system certainly 
      has its advantages, if the master is fully competent. But was Captain Arvo 
      Andresson fully competent? This is questioned by someone who has worked 
      with Andresson.<br>
      When the Estonian Shipping Company ESCO took over "Estonia" the Swedish 
      part owner of Estline, N&T, employed a number of advisers, actually assistant 
      masters and crew members working in other functions, who were to train and 
      control the Estonian crew members to make sure that they really knew what 
      they were doing.<br>
      Initially N&T wanted to have a Swedish master, chief officer and chief engineer 
      for the vessel, although sailing under Estonian flag, however, ESCO refused 
      to accept that. Instead, the Swedish "advisers" were employed. <br>
      One of the Swedish assistant masters, Anders Andersson, worked for quite 
      some time with Arvo Andresson. He has described the Estonian master to the 
      Joint Accident Investigation Commission as having been arrogant and nonchalant, 
      and having strictly upheld discipline and the hierarchy on board. He pursued 
      this so rigorously that he even changed the crew in the hotel and restaurant 
      sections, even if the results were catastrophic. The Swedish and Finnish 
      advisers were professionals from Viking, Silja, and Estline's previous vessel 
      "Nord Estonia" in respective positions on board, such as hotel, restaurants, 
      tax free and business shops. This worked very well and effectively until 
      Arvo Andresson changed everything and put incompetent Estonian personnel 
      into management positions, no matter what effect that had on the business 
      results. <br>
      All this was reported to Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Manager of N&T, 
      who spoke to Arvo Andresson requesting him not to interfere with matters 
      which he did not understand. To discuss these things with ESCO "was totally 
      useless as they under all circumstances strengthened the position of Arvo 
      Andresson. He had an untouchable position within ESCO".<br>
      When "Estonia" was taken over and Andersson and Andresson met for the first 
      time, Andersson asked Arvo Andresson how he managed the change from "Georg 
      Otts" to "Estonia" and Arvo Andresson just replied "vessel is vessel". This 
      explains a lot about Arvo Andresson because 9 months on the "Georg Otts", 
      a small ferry without much windage sailing between Helsinki and Tallinn, 
      can naturally in no way be a proper preparation for taking over the command 
      of a ferry like "Estonia" with a substantially larger windage and other 
      relevant differences. As a confirmation, the vessel grounded near Sandhamn 
      soon after the service had been opened, because Arvo Andresson had totally 
      underestimated the drifting speed. <br>
      All vessels which regularly call at Stockholm have a wind restriction for 
      the passing of Farfarsgrundet (Sandhamn). The large Silja and Viking ferries 
      do not enter here if the wind speed is in excess of 15 m/sec. from S/SW, 
      then they use the northern entrance (Söderarm). For the considerably smaller 
      "Estonia" the senior pilot of Stockholm had set the limit to 10 m/sec. <br>
      The experience of Arvo Andresson in ferry traffic was restricted to the 
      Helsinki-Tallinn service. There are 3 smaller ferries: "Georg Otts", "Vaana 
      Tallinn" and "Tallink" which go daily both ways. Reportedly these relatively 
      small vessels always used tugs.<br>
      "Estonia" had the highest ice class and 24000 hp, whilst "Georg Otts" was 
      so low powered that they always had to run the engines at full speed against 
      heavy seas or ice in order to make some headway at all. To proceed with 
      "Estonia" against heavy head seas, however, required a lot of experience 
      as otherwise quite some damage could be done to the foreship with such powerful 
      engines. This experience Arvo Andresson did not have. This became obvious 
      rather quickly after the take-over at Turku, when "Estonia" departed and 
      he misjudged the wind completely and used the propellers the wrong way so 
      that the vessel almost hit the quay. Subsequently he admitted to Andersson 
      that he had difficulties with manoeuvring the engines and also mixed up 
      port and starboard.<br>
      Similar incidents happened frequently during the following months. <br>
      According to the Swedish captain the Estonians also never did learn how 
      to properly load the "Estonia". It is important to load a Ro-Ro vessel correctly, 
      both in order to obtain the correct trim in the ballast tanks considering 
      the wind and in order to prevent the vessel from heeling.<br>
      The mates were sitting all afternoon with their cargo plan, only to discover 
      that it did not function when the cars were rolling on board. There were 
      always significant changes in the bookings at the last minute. Then emergency 
      solutions had to be found in order to take all cars on board. Simultaneously, 
      there was an aversion within ESCO against the Swedish interfering on board. 
      <br>
      As master, Arvo Andresson was dominant and authoritarian. The mates never 
      dared even to come close to the sticks (Note: pitch controls), not even 
      the chief officer who normally has to be able to manoeuvre the vessel. Andresson 
      was a product of the Soviet system. Once when he damaged the quay at Frihamn 
      in Stockholm with the aft of the vessel, he did not accept to write a report 
      to the ship owners. "I will be able to persuade my mates to testify that 
      the damages to the quay were already existing when we arrived", he said. 
      <br>
      The Swedish captain describes the difference between an Estonian and a Swedish 
      or Finnish vessel as follows: "On a Swedish ferry the mate first reduces 
      the speed and does thereafter inform the master about what he has done. 
      As regards "Estonia", it was the other way round."<br>
      Generally, there was a poor ability to take initiatives within the crew, 
      probably as a result of the old system. Nobody dared to take his own initiative.«

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andersson had been 
    on the WASA KING since October 1992 to become acquainted with the vessel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T took over the 
    complete safety organisation from NORD ESTONIA and transferred it without 
    changes to ESTONIA, although this vessel was much larger, had more crew members, 
    for example a radio operator which the NORD ESTONIA did not have. Therefore 
    the ESTONIA radio operator was not mentioned in the safety role and thus had 
    no function in case of emergency.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> His wife Marlene 
    was the restaurant and hotel manager and remained on board until July 1994. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There had been plenty 
    of occurrences with drunken Estonian crew members; in the crew's dayroom it 
    was almost always party time on the last trip to Stockholm before the relief 
    crew would take over on the following day (also on the last voyage).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There were lots 
    of problems with Arvo Andresson who was absolutely unsuitable for passenger 
    vessels; everything was much easier with Avo Piht, who already had experience 
    with Baltic ferries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andresson also 
    had a problem taking decisions by himself since he was always used to having 
    somebody above him. This became drastically obvious in stress situations when 
    quick decisions had to be made. Typical were two occurrences, viz:</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a)</b> A passenger 
    sustained a heart attack at sea and Andresson was totally helpless, did not 
    know what to do and asked Marlene Andersson what he should do.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(b)</b> When 
    60 Iraqis were discovered in a container on the car deck he did not know what 
    to do either or how to behave, phoned his principals in Tallinn and asked 
    what he should do.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Very often relatives 
    of the crew members simply stayed on board in Tallinn for the whole round-trip 
    without being registered and without Arvo Andresson doing anything against 
    it although he knew of it. It was easy for non-crew members to get on board. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Marlene Andersson 
    as well as Arvo Andresson respectively Avo Piht attended the Estline board 
    meetings when they took place on the ESTONIA. Frequently there was an irritated, 
    stressed atmosphere. There were also language problems. The Swedes and Estonians 
    were sometimes shouting at each other. Also Peter Barasinski, an ex restaurant 
    chef on the ESTONIA, has reported that he had been told by his wife Carita, 
    who was a conference hostess on ESTONIA (did not survive), that during the 
    meetings of the Estline Board of Directors, which were held on board the ESTONIA, 
    there had always been clashes and that the N&T and ESCO representatives had 
    shouted at each other in loud voices and with red faces, and that this had 
    been so up to the end.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for Arvo 
    Andresson seen with the eyes of Anders Andersson and his wife. Some of this 
    is confirmed by the Finnish advisers who have told this 'Group of Experts' 
    that it always took unusually long for Andresson to get the vessel alongside 
    and that the berthing manoeuvres were quite often accompanied by impacts. 
    They also recounted that during the first real heavy weather voyage from Tallinn 
    to Stockholm Anders Andersson decided to enter the archipelago at Utö and 
    proceed inside up to Söderarm for the safety and comfort of passengers and 
    crew and, last but not least, the vessel. Reportedly this also led to a major 
    clash with Andresson and ESCO although no time was lost, and, because there 
    was absolutely no support from N&T, was never repeated by Andersson. The Finnish 
    advisers have also stated that at the beginning when the vessel was proceeding 
    too fast against head seas passengers complained to the Information desk, 
    whereafter the girls phoned the bridge and passed on the complaints, but were 
    harshly brushed off and never dared to do it again. (For more details about 
    Captain Arvo Andresson see also Chapter 13.) </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The requirements 
    for emergency and lifesaving equipment are governed in detail by the SOLAS 
    Convention. The vessel was built to SOLAS 1974, <b>but the first PSSC was 
    issued on a form which referred to SOLAS 1960</b> (see 2.4.4.). The F.B.N. 
    surveyed the vessel for compliance with the requirements while she flew the 
    Finnish flag, and B.V. surveyed on behalf of the E.N.M.B. during the following 
    period assisted by the Swedish Shipinspec as far as the take-over was concerned. 
    The surveys were annual and the surveys in connection with the change of flag 
    were performed by senior staff members of B.V. and Shipinspec at Turku and 
    in Tallinn. For details reference is made to Subchapters 6.4 - 6.5.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was equipped 
    with ten motor-driven lifeboats of open type and of fibre-glass construction. 
    The first boat on the starboard side - lifeboat no. 1 - was a man overboard 
    (MOB) rescue boat, i.e. the emergency boat. Two boats were equipped with searchlights. 
    The boats were suspended under davits on deck 8. Embarkation was from deck 
    7. The vessel also carried 63 inflatable rafts, which were packed in containers 
    stowed on decks 7 and 8 and were equipped with hydrostatic release mechanisms. 
    Twelve rafts were equipped to be launched by davits, four of which were installed 
    on deck 7. The remaining rafts were intended to be dropped into the sea. With 
    one exception, the rafts were manufactured in 1980 and delivered to the VIKING 
    SALLY during construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    JAIC lifeboats and rafts provided on board satisfied the SOLAS 1974 requirements 
    as to number and standard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The lifeboats and 
    rafts were surveyed every year in conjunction with the issuance of the Passenger 
    Ship Safety Certificate. The last survey was in June 1994.</font></p>

    on each side of the ship was equipped with a lifeline and with self-activating 
    light and smoke signals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were 2298 lifejackets 
    for adults and 200 lifejackets for children on board. All the jackets were

    system incorporating 197 alarm bells and 11 alarm sirens.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system 
    was function tested once a week. The audibility of the system against the 
    background noise in the accommodation areas had been judged to be adequate, 
    although no documented measurements had been made.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarms were installed 
    in the passageways and public spaces as well as in non-passenger areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system 
    operated on the 220 V system and was connected to the main- and emergency 
    generator systems. The alarm system was not powered by the emergency batteries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarm buttons were 
    installed on every deck, including the sections and work rooms of the crew. 
    By pressing an alarm button an audible signal was triggered off on the navigation 
    bridge and an indicator showed which section the alarm was coming from. In 
    case of no reaction within 30 seconds, the alarm in the entire vessel was 
    automatically activated. The receipt of one signal on the bridge did not prevent 
    the receipt of additional signals from other alarm buttons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The public address 
    system was operated from the navigation bridge and also from the Information 
    desk. The microphone on the bridge had priority over the one at the Information

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Bureau Veritas 
    inspected the vessel for compliance with the class requirements in accordance 
    with their rules and standards. The main inspection period was five years 
    and the 1500 items to be inspected were divided into approximately 300 items 
    to be inspected each year according to the Continuous Survey Programme of 
    Bureau Veritas. The bow area under this programme was inspected in 1983, 1988 
    and in 1993. No discrepancies were recorded during any of these inspections. 
    The question remains why the severe deficiencies of the visor and the bow 
    ramp which clearly existed already in 1993 were not recorded. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the available 
    documentation it has to be assumed that the two B.V. people responsible for 
    the ESTONIA, both from a classification and statutory point of view, Hans 
    Olsson, manager of BV-Sweden, and Anders Wirstam, staff surveyor of the BV-Stockholm 
    office and exclusively involved with ESTONIA, were not interrogated by Joint 
    Accident Investigation Commission and there is no recorded evidence in the 
    files of the Swedish part of this Commission about their interrogations by 
    the police and the prosecutor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In a memo found in 
    the files of the prosecutor the following is, however, stated: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On 12.10.1994 
      at 12.10 hours I had contact with the manager of B.V. in Gothenburg, Hans 
      Olsson, Tel. (031) 17 14 15. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      subject was which surveys they had done on the "Estonia". All the relevant 
      documentation was with them; Olsson stated that he could not submit any 
      documents without the respective authority. In case he should have to do 
      so, he would need the approval partly from N&T, partly from the Estonian 
      Government.<br>
      Olsson even wishes to inform the lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson by telephone 
      (08) 665 90 70. This lawyer protects them legally. <br>
      Olsson also advised that Olof Forssberg from the Commission had already 
      given the same explanation as the police now give. Forssberg raised the 
      same questions which the police are now asking. Olsson knew that Forssberg 
      had been in contact with the owners in this matter, N&T had been in contact 
      with Olsson and they will send a letter with what Forssberg wants to know. 
      <br>
      The documentation concerning "Estonia" consists of a large number of A4 
      folders. <br>
      Olsson requires a written statement from the police with the documents they 
      are demanding. Before this the police have to contact N&T - S.M. (Sven Malmroos).<br>
      In the course of the further development I managed to contact sometimes 
      the prosecutor and sometimes Forssberg.<br>
      Some co-ordination has to be found. / S.M. (Sven Malmroos).«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that 
    B.V. apparently enjoyed some special treatment as did N&T and ESCO, which 
    continued throughout the investigation up-to-date. Reportedly Hans Olsson 
    left B.V. in the summer of 1998 and might thus be willing to give some explanations 
    now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The files of the 
    prosecutor reveal that Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam were interrogated together 
    for the first time on 21.11.1994 by the criminal inspectors L.E. Andersson 
    and S.A. Wranding. On 02.06.1997 Hans Olsson was questioned alone by the criminal 
    inspector Bo Wide and thereafter Anders Wirstam was questioned again and alone 
    on 22.01.1998 also by Bo Wide and Tomas Lindstrand. </font></p>

    Port State Control Inspections</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The situation as 
    to the allegedly performed Port State Control (PSC) inspection is confusing:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) According 
      to a memo by Sven Malmroos, investigating police inspector during the early 
      days, he was advised on 12.10.1994 by Eva Lindström from the Sjöfartsverket 
      head office that two operative controls had been carried out by them, one 
      at the beginning of 1993 (during take-over) and another one at the beginning 
      of 1994, which is unknown unless they mean the RITS exercise on 01.02.1994, 
      which was actually a bomb exercise and not an operative control. The memo 
      of Sven Malmroos is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.3.137.htm" target="_blank"> 
      Enclosure 9.3.137.</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) According 
      to the JAIC there had been four inspections: the take-over inspection, which 
      had to be considered a Port State Control (PSC) inspection, - see Subchapter 
      6.5.2 - and three further PSC inspections during the following 20 months. 
      One was supposed to have been carried out in connection with an oil spill 
      caused by leaking stern-tube seals already in April 1993, another one was 
      supposed to have been in December 1993 and the final one was said to have 
      been in March 1994 which allegedly did not give rise to any remark. See 
      the JAIC Report - Subchapter 3.2.10. The JAIC reports further in Subchapter 
      5.3: "During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme 
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port 
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on 
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough 
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed 
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise 
      was documented in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. 
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement.<br>
      The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by the 
      Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and very 
      well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused detention 
      or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular Port State 
      Control." </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">(c) The Independent Fact 
      Group (IFG), Stockholm searched the archives of the Shipinspec Stockholm 
      office in autumn 1998 and found protocols about PSC inspections performed 
      on the following days: </font></p>

        02.03.1994 </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These dates include the 
      take-over in Tallinn on 01.02.93, followed by two oil spills on 02.04.93 
      and 06.04.93, and another two in December 1993 and in March 1994 which are 
      unknown. The RITS Exercise is not included. Actually Ulf Beijner, then the 
      head of the Sjöfartsverket's Shipinspec office in Stockholm, confirmed to 
      a member of this 'Group of Experts' and the safety inspector, Peter Hoffsten, 
      confirmed to Tommy Lindström, who investigated the matter on behalf of the 
      relatives organisation SEA, that they had never carried out a real PSC inspection.

  Builders - Meyer Werft, Papenburg </font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Meyer Werft - 
    Jos. L. Meyer GmbH - at Papenburg/Ems was founded already in 1795 and has 
    been owned by the Meyer family ever since. During the last decades Meyer Werft 
    has achieved an excellent reputation for the building of special-purpose vessels, 
    in particular, passenger ships, luxury car/passenger ferries and Ro-Ro vessels. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Up to date more than 
    60 of the above types of vessels have been built by Meyer Werft. Furthermore, 
    the Yard is specialised in the building of passenger-ships and gas carriers 
    for the transport of liquid and chemical gases. Presently about 60 passengerships/ferries 
    and 47 gas carriers have been delivered. Shiprepair activities are mainly 
    concentrated on jumboizing and converting ferries, passenger ships, freighters, 
    and tankers. In addition, the Yard is the world's leader in converting freighters 
    and tankers into livestock carriers. Up to now 25 vessels of this type have 
    been converted for the transport of sheep and cows as well as camels and horses. 
    Apart from the above-mentioned activities the Meyer Werft is also engaged 
    in structural construction and engine building, which includes the fabrication 
    of pressure tanks and special aluminium constructions. In 1975 a new shipyard 
    was built which belongs to the most modern in Europe. In November 1987 the 
    largest graving dock under roof was inaugurated which had to be lengthened 
    by 100 m already in 1990/91. Presently about 2000 staff are employed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">So far the Yard has 
    built respectively has under construction/on order: </font></p>

    </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious that 
    survival in a very competitive, tough market was and is only possible by fine 
    workmanship and delivery according to promise. For this the Meyer Werft is 
    well known. The "Reference Lists for Ferries and Gastankers" - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.1.1.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosures 2.1.1</a> / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..1.2.htm" target="_blank">2.1.2 
    </a>- confirm this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On this basis, as 
    well as having very good relationships to Sweden and Finland, the Meyer Werft 
    has succeeded since 1969 in obtaining orders to build a series of car/passenger 
    ferries for AB Slite/Stockholm and AB Sally/ Mariehamn and - apart from the 
    guarantee disputes usual for technically complicated newbuildings - delivering 
    these to the entire satisfaction of the buyers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All these vessels 
    - except for the last one: SILJA EUROPA - have been employed in the Viking 
    Line Service, either between Turku - Mariehamn - Stockholm or between Helsinki 
    and Stockholm. This service was then operated by a consortium consisting of 
    the Swedish AB Slite as well as the Finnish companies AB Sally and SF-Line. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first ferry of 
    these series by the name APOLLO was delivered in 1970 to AB Slite, followed 
    by MV DIANA for the same owners, and VIKING 1, 3, 4 and 5 for AB Sally. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The third partner 
    of the Viking Line consortium, SF-Line, ordered their newbuildings with other 
    yards, e.g. the TURELLA was built by Sietas Yard, Hamburg and other ferries 
    were built in Yugoslavia as well as by the then Wärtsilä Yard in Turku, Finland 
    (e.g. MARIELLA). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All of the vessels 
    built by Meyer Werft for AB Slite and AB Sally were classed by Bureau Veritas 
    (B.V.) and built under the supervision of the respective National Shipping 
    Administration, i.e. for the Slite vessels the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and 
    for the AB Sally vessels the Finnish Sjöfarts-styrelsen, the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation (F.B.N.). The 6 ferries were sister vessels, apart from VIKING 
    5 which had the same breadth but was 13.8 m longer. All vessels were constructed 
    with visor, bow and stern ramps. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The building files 
    of Meyer Werft reveal that due to the continued close co-operation lasting 
    for years between the Yard, supervisors of owners as well as representatives 
    of class and Sjöfartsverket respectively F.B.N. a relationship of confidence 
    had developed between the participating persons. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On behalf of Bureau 
    Veritas this was their inspector Günther Lohmann, who was engaged with Meyer 
    Werft newbuildings for many years, whilst Sjöfartsverket was represented by 
    the then Rotterdam office manager, H. Sjöholm and the representatives for 
    F.B.N. were Gunnar Edelmann (shipbuilding matters/stability), Pertti Haatainen 
    (lifesaving) and Jan Jansson (fire-fighting).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All 6 vessels had 
    the connection visor/bow ramp, i.e. the upper part of the closed bow ramp 
    extended into a box-shaped structure on the forecastle which was part of the 
    visor. None of the vessels had the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above the bulkhead deck, i.e. the car deck, installed at the location which 
    was required by SOLAS since 1948, but the weathertight bow ramp was generally 
    considered to be the extension of the collision bulkhead. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Despite this deviation 
    from the wording of SOLAS all these vessels, as well as more than 30 other 
    ferries constructed similarly, were fully accepted by the Classification Societies 
    and by the Maritime Administrations of the Nordic countries. According to 
    the findings of the JAIC this practice was well known to insiders as the 'General 
    Scandinavian Practice'. </font></p>
