  Introduction</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Officially 
    137 persons have survived the catastrophe, some are crew members, two are 
    advisors and the others are passengers. Most of them have testified to the 
    police in Finland, Sweden and/or Estonia, some three or more times. Only a 
    few crew members have been questioned directly by the JAIC.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They 
    are:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 3rd engineer 
        Margus Treu <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">motorman

        engineer Henrik Sillaste <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">trainee 
        officer Einar Kukk <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">purser 
        Andres Vihmar (only by Bengt Schager).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has also 
    interviewed only very few of the passengers or advisers directly, e.g. Pierre 
    Thiger has been interrogated by Olof Forsberg and the statement is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.1.248.1.</a> The Finnish Commission member Tuomo Karppinen has spoken by 
    telephone to the truck driver Eckard Klug and to the advisors Paula Liikamaa 
    and Peter Järvinen. The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.1.248.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andi Meister's book<i> 
    "The Unfinished Logbook"</i> and also the interview which Jutta Rabe held 
    with him and subsequently with Bengt Schager, the psychological expert to 
    the Swedish part of JAIC, reveal however that the Estonian Commission members 
    as well as the Estonian security police and other government bodies have frequently 
    spoken to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. 
    It is unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings 
    are not available. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    Kari Lethola, chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, the following survivors 
    have not been interrogated at all:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Igor Gricius 
        from Dobele/Latvia,<br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Gull-Britt 
        Payr from Stockholm, <br>
        </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arturas 
        Tamasauskas from Paneveöys/Lithuania.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the latter 
    it is only known that he was the driver of the Lithuanian van, No. CVK 445. 
    He refused to testify at all and left the hospital without permission. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Of the other 133 
    survivors, however, at least one statement of each is available to this 'Group 
    of Experts'; in total there are 243! Contact was made with some of the key 
    witnesses and additional information was obtained and/or relevant information 
    was confirmed. These interviews - in addition to the statements taken by the 
    police - are also available on video cassettes. The interviews were either 
    carried out by a member of this 'Group of Experts', by the Finnish lawyer 
    Henrik Gahmberg or by the Estonian journalist Juri Liim in close co-operation 
    or in the presence of a member of this 'Group of Experts'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The relevant parts 
    of some of the statements and all of the interviews have been translated into 
    English and are attached as enclosures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All the available 
    statements and interviews have been analysed, but only those statements of 
    crew members made on the day of their rescue, or shortly thereafter, were 
    considered to be reliable and thus possibly not influenced by the ESCO/Estline/N&T 
    representatives and/or other interested parties. Similar weight was put on 
    statements and interviews where members of this 'Group of Experts' were present 
    and could talk to the survivor directly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Several drawings 
    are attached which indicate the layout of the crew and passenger cabins on 
    all decks, the car deck with centre casing and lift arrange-ments, the 1st 
    deck with passenger accommodation and engine control room (ECR), further the 
    0-deck with sauna/swimming pool/conference compartments and the sewage treatment 
    area with the vacuum system directly next respectively aft of it and, further 
    aft, the location of the heeling tanks and the stabiliser pockets directly 
    aft of the heeling tanks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of the 
    analyses of all the available statements and interviews with regard to the 
    time up to and including the casualty sequence of-events are outlined in the 
    following Subchapters 21.2 - 21.9.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other relevant observations 
    made by survivors during and after the sinking, while waiting to be rescued 
    and subsequently after their rescue, is explained in Subchapter 21.8 - Other 
    Observations.</font></p>

    21.2.1.252 </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At about 23.00 
    hours a large wave hit the vessel's port bow.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The master came 
    to the bridge again about 30 minutes later and asked the 3rd officer whether 
    all 4 engines were running, which was confirmed. The master then ordered that 
    the stabilisers were to be activated <b>after the next course change </b>and 
    left the bridge approximately 15 minutes before, i.e. at about 00.05/00.10 
    hours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The wind was coming 
    from SW and veering West, whilst the waves came more from southerly directions. 
    The sea was quite heavy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He was apparently 
    still on the bridge<b> when the vessel changed course around 00.25-00.30 hours, 
    although he never said so,</b> but he stated that the 2nd officer told him 
    that the vessel would make about 1 knot less speed after the stabilisers had 
    been activated. The speed was then about 14.5-15.0 knots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At about 00.30 
    hours Silver Linde returned to the bridge and Einar Kukk left for his cabin; 
    in his last statement - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.1.252.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.1.252</a> - he said that Linde left the bridge at this time for a new 
    round.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He went to his 
    cabin, cleared up some matters and then went to Pub Admiral, where also Karaoke 
    was being performed (5th deck, starboard side, aft). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There he saw Silver 
    Linde in the door at about 00.40 hours. Kukk left after some minutes and went 
    to his cabin. There he arrived at ca. 00.50 hours, went to bed, but could 
    not sleep.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>After 5-10 
    minutes</b> he heard <b>a very strange noise which was very unusual </b>(and 
    alarming) to him, it could have been an impact or strong vibration and the 
    vessel behaved very strangely; he got up and dressed; <b>while he was putting 
    on his shoes the vessel rocked and heeled abruptly to starboard</b>, he cannot 
    say how much, but it was very far. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- He rushed up to 
    the 7th deck and<b> met boatswain Vello Ruben in the central stairway,</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    means that the boatswain had been somewhere further down when the heel occurred 
    - most probably on the car deck - because his cabin was on deck 7. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when he was between 
    6th/7th deck he noted a shock/vibration inside the vessel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>He and the 
    boatswain helped each other out of the door on to the open deck 7; </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the list was then 
    about 45° and the engines had definitely stopped;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - on deck 7 he met 
    Ivan Ziljajev, a crew member with a walkie-talkie, and <b>further forward 
    in a liferaft, Silver Linde; </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when the list was 
    90°, he looked at his watch: it was 01.30 hours and he slid into the water, 
    the stern was then submerged up to the stabiliser fin.</font></p>
