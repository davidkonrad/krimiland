  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="4"><b>A SHIP EMANATING 
    FROM THE BALTIC PHENOMENON</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The attached 
    report - made up by ADC Support AB, Stockholm on request of the JAIC - contains 
    a historical overview of the ferry traffic between Finland and Sweden with 
    the rapidly growing number of passengers as well as of cars/trucks and the 
    rapidly growing ferries. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The VIKING SALLY, 
    designed and constructed to cope with this fast development - called "The 
    Baltic Phenomenon" - was considered the trend-setter when she took up service 
    in the early 1980's with Viking Line. The effect of competition between the 
    two main operators in these trades, i.e. Silja and Viking, on the design and 
    construction of the ever growing ferries, and even on the safety philosophy 
    of the two operators, is clearly outlined. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the development 
    between 1959 and 1993 of the visor with ramp house construction - called "garage" 
    in the report - in comparison to other visor constructions and bow doors on 
    Silja and Viking Line ferries was examined in the report. The result is that 
    Silja commissioned 25 ferries during these 34 years, of which 7 were fitted 
    with a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the FINLANDIA and 
    SILJA REGINA commissioned in 1981. Viking Line did bring 41 ferries into service, 
    of which 27 had a visor/ramp house construction, the last ones being the OLYMPIA 
    in 1986 (sailing in P&O charter as PRIDE OF BILBAO between Southampton and 
    Bilbao/Spain since her sale) and ALANDFÅRJAN in 1987. This demonstrates that 
    it was absolutely common in those years, and in conformity with the state-of-the-art, 
    to apply this construction - bow ramp extending into a ramp house which was 
    part of the visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report further 
    discusses the safety culture existing for decades within the Silja and Viking 
    organisations and on the basis of which the "ships" navigation and operation 
    at sea was not considered to be a main "risk factor" as the long-term experience 
    had proved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The collective record 
    of Silja and Viking Lines from 1960 to 1995 is five killed passengers on 107 
    million passenger single trips, i.e. one casualty per almost 18 million single 
    trips. Moreover, these 5 passengers were killed in one collision in a narrow 
    fairway. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to ESTONIA's crew 
    recruited exclusively from ESCO staff, the author indicates by means of comparison 
    between the power/breadth ratios of the Silja/Viking ferries in 1993, which 
    was between 700-1000 kW/m and the ESCO vessels at the same time, which was 
    between 100-300 kW/m except for GEORG OTTS being 600 kW/m, that the ESTONIA 
    crew might not have had sufficient experience to handle the vessel competently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report has been 
    prepared by the Naval Architect Hans Wermelin, thus from the point of view 
    of a naval architect based on his knowledge at the end of 1995.Consequently 
    it ends with the following remarks:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »This overview with 
    the explanations of the work with safety is contrasting to the Estonia catastrophe. 
    The reason is that until this happened the design philosophy was that big 
    volumes of water should not enter into cargo deck when the ship was properly 
    closed at sea. When the catastrophe showed this was a false philosophy an 
    intensive work started to make these ships safe regardless of water on cargo 
    deck. In fact this work was already started after the catastrophe with the 
    Herald of Free Enterprise. Thus the latest purposely built ships in the trade 
    manage to carry a lot of water on the cargo deck: M/S Silja Symphony and M/S 
    Silja Serenade manage one meter and M/S Silja Europa has to sink before she 
    capsizes.«</font></p>
