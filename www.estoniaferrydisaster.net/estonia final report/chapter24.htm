<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>LOCATING THE WRECK AND THE 
  VISOR</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The search 
    for the wreck and the visor of the ESTONIA was organised and performed by 
    the Finnish Board of Navigation (F.B.N.), the Finnish Navy and the Finnish 
    Coast Guard in close co-operation with the Accident Investigation Board, the 
    Finnish part of the JAIC. The survey vessels SUUNTA and EVA-200 (Estonian) 
    as well as the oil-pollution fighting vessel HALLI and the Coast Guard vessel 
    TURSAS were employed for various operations. In addition, an unknown Finnish 
    reconnaissance vessel and three Swedish mine hunters were engaged during the 
    time between locating the wreck (and the visor) on 30.09.94 and the official 
    locating of the visor on 18.10.94.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">What 
    actually happened during this time lies in darkness and can only be assumed 
    to some extent from the facsimile messages sent by Kari Lethola, head of the 
    Finnish part of the JAIC (PCIMA), to Olof Forsberg, head of the Swedish part 
    of the JAIC. These faxes were found in the archives of the Swedish Commission 
    (SHK), but it has to be excluded that the sequence is complete. Also some 
    of the publications in "Svenska Dagbladet" (SvD) and "Dagens Nyheter" (DN) 
    in those days throw light on the probable occurrences.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>In detail:</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) By fax 
    of 30.09.94 Kari Lethola informed SHK that the wreck had been found on position 
    59°23'N; 21°42'E. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.393.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.393 </a>- although this position lies 0.5 nm in direction 83° away from 
    the actual wreck position 59°22,9'N; 21°41,0'E which is correctly stated to 
    be the as-found position in the report of the JAIC.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The heading is approximately 
    east and the wreck is lying on her starboard side with a list of about 120°. 
    The water depth above the bow is 85 m and above the stern is 74 m. The highest 
    point of the wreck is the stern with 58 m of water above. The wreck is resting 
    on soft clay on the top with stiff boulder clay below. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A side scan 
    sonar survey of the area around the wreck revealed debris in an area of up 
    to 350 m to the south and the west of the wreck.</font></p>

      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two 
      ROVs were successful on Sunday in video filming the "Estonia". The commission 
      has issued strict orders to the oil-pollution fighting vessel "Halli", which 
      carried out the operation, not to talk about or show the films made so far.<br>
      Apparently it becomes more and more certain that the visor in front of the 
      bow ramp to the car deck has been the cause for the casualty. Dr. Jouko 
      Nuorteva, who analysed the sonar pictures taken after "Estonia" had been 
      located, could give them a new interpretation on Sunday.<br>
      According to Nuorteva is the vessel lying on an easterly heading and in 
      the course direction as it had been assumed in the beginning. <b>Adjacent 
      to the bow there is a big object which was either torn off or is hanging 
      from the hull. According to Nuorteva the object could be the damaged visor 
      or part of it. </b>The video pictures should explain if the visor had indeed 
      such a big damage. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Detailed 
      photographs. </b><br>
      The investigators do have access now to many hours of video tapes as well 
      as to numerous still pictures both in black and white and in colour. "The 
      pictures are of high quality, so much we can say", said Kari Lethola. "At 
      first the pictures shall be analysed by the commission and then we shall 
      decide what can be published", said Lethola.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>It 
    has been confirmed by the man in charge of the interpretation / evaluation 
    work that there was<b> a big object adjacent to the hull which could be the 
    damaged visor or part of it</b>. The question whether this was the case or 
    not was clearly answered by the ROV investigations of the bow area on 02.10 
    and 09.10.94, however, no clear answers were given to the public and the respective 
    sequences of the relevant video tapes received subsequently from the JAIC

      The JAIC gave a few preliminary explanations of the video pictures taken

    states that the search for the visor continued, although it had been known 
    to the JAIC already since 02.10.94 that the visor was lying next to the bow 
    of the wreck. This is even indicated on the drawing being part of the fax 
    where a smaller separate object can be noted to the starboard side of the 
    bow. Moreover, the area indicated on the same drawing as having been searched 
    - 2 nm to the east of the wreck, 1 nm to the west of the wreck and 1 nm to 
    the south, i.e. a rectangular 3 nm x 1 nm - includes the position where the 
    visor was allegedly found on 18.10.94, i.e. in position 59°22,97'N; 21°39,33'E 
    according to the Finnish Navy and in position 59°23'N, 21°39,2'E according 
    to the Swedish Navy - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.398.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.398</a> - Letter Försvarsmakten (Defence Forces) to SHK dated 09.12.94. 
    It is difficult to believe that such a big steel mass as the visor should 
    have been overlooked or should not have been indicated on the sonar. The remark 
    at the end of the fax that<i> "the Norwegian SCS is still active and receives 
    free marketing by the press"</i> suggests that the Norwegians had offered 
    some services which had been rejected by the JAIC and that the operation was 
    performed by Finnish vessels apparently without the expected success. Therefore 
    Lethola was now asking Sweden to send vessels to help search for <i>"what 
    we were looking for"</i>. It is difficult to believe that this relates to 
    the visor which by then must have already been found since some days. The 
    Norwegian involvement needs to be investigated.</font></p>

      for your fax and the good pictures of visor and ramp. We changed our plans 
      and went out already on Sunday because we thought that we had found the 
      visor by sonar. We could not find the visor by ROV. We filmed again visor 
      and ramp by ROV. A summary of our observations is attached. I will have 
      the video film with me and we can look at it on Monday evening at Nådendal

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>Now 
    they receive assistance from Finnish Naval Forces with whom the sonar expert 
    Dr. Nuorteva is employed. Nevertheless they need the help of a Swedish mine 
    hunting expert already by Friday, 14.10.94, although the search for the visor 
    was scheduled to commence only on Monday, 17.10.94. This could lead to the 
    assumption that Swedish mines were somehow involved, i.e. since the ESTONIA 
    and her visor were resting more or less directly on the line Utö-Ristna it 
    might be that there was a Swedish mine field in that area.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No more facsimile 
    messages are available and on 18.10.94 the visor was finally also officially 
    found, however, in position<b> 59°23,0'N; 21°39,2'E,</b> which is 0.85 nm 
    in direction 272° from the actual wreck position - see also <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.398.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.398</a> - but 1.7 nm in direction 238° from the wreck position stated to 
    be the original location position - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.407.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.407</a> - which is<b> 59°23,9'N; 21°42,1'E.</b> The actual wreck position 
    59°22,9'N; 21°41,0'E, which has been verified by tug "OTTO WULF 4" on 30.06.95, 
    is 2112 m distant in direction 211° from the Finnish "original location position". 
    Since a wreck from the ESTONIA dimensions cannot move for 2100 m over the 
    sea bottom the original location position has been wrong from the beginning, 
    which is confirmed by Kari Lethola's first fax - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.393.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.393</a> - where he stated the original position to be 59°23'N; 21°42'E 
    which is almost correct except that the latitude should be 21°41'. In any 
    event, on 02.10.94 and 09.10.94 they did carry out very detailed ROV investigations 
    of the wreck and probably also of the visor then lying with great probability 
    below the bulbous bow.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It therefore has 
    to be assumed that the Finns deliberately moved the wreck position 1.7 nm 
    to the NNE. This wrong position was maintained during October and November 
    and was even taken over by Sjöfartsverket in the specification drawn up by 
    this administration for tendering the diving investigation of the wreck, which 
    was sent to 11 different companies, where the following positions are stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> bow : 59°23,91'N; 
      21°42,17'E<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">stern : 59°23,92'N; 
      21°42,03'E </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Smit/Rockwater were 
    awarded the contract to examine the wreck and the surrounding sea bottom. 
    Even when their diving support vessel "SEMI I" and the survey vessel "SIRA 
    SUPPORTER" with Johan Fransson and experts from Sjöfartsverket, Tuomo Karppinen 
    and others from Finland, Börje Stenström from the JAIC and Arne Valgma from 
    the E.N.M.B. together with an unknown number of criminal and other policemen 
    were approach-ing the area allegedly the Smit/Rockwater people did not get 
    a corrected position and consequently sent the ROVs down at the wrong position. 
    This is - at least - what is reported and the actual wreck position was subsequently 
    found by the SIRA SUPPORTER by means of the ORE sidescan sonar tow fish. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason 
    why all this was necessary is unknown to this 'Group of Experts', but it has 
    to be assumed that the apologetic letter that Kari Lethola wrote to the Traffic 
    Ministry on 11.01.95, wherein he explains that he had possibly exceeded his 
    authority when "isolating the wreck", has to be understood in this connection. 
    The letter with office translation is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.408.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.408.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be assumed that the Swedes and Finns had found the visor next to the bow 
    of the wreck, possibly the bulbous bow even resting on the visor, already 
    on the 01. or 02.10.94, but decided to keep this secret as well as the actual 
    position of the wreck and to continue the search for the visor. The Estonians 
    were sent to search to the East (where the visor definitely never was) while 
    the Finns with the help of Swedish mine hunting experts and vessels clarified 
    something around the wreck which apparently had to do with Swedish mines. 
    On 18.10.94 the visor was "officially" located and sometime later the "mines" 
    operation was completed, whereafter <b>the recovery of the visor at a position 
    about 2100 m SSW off the alleged wreck position was carried out from 12th 
    to 19th November 1994.</b> The visor was picked-up and lifted to the surface 
    by the Finnish multi-purpose ice breaker NORDICA assisted by the Swedish mine 
    hunter FURUSUND. According to the entries into the logbook of the NORDICA 
    - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.408.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    24.408.1</a> - the visor was picked-up in position 59°23' N; 21°39,4' E. This 
    was ca. 1400 m West of the wreck position. </font></p>
