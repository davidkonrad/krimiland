  Sjöfartsstyrelsen - and newbuilding supervision -<br>
  </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="4"><b>The Passenger 
  Ship Safety Certificate </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was built 
    for the operation under Finnish flag and consequently had to comply with the 
    regulations of the National Maritime Administration, then the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation respectively Sjöfartsstyrelsen. Approval of all safety relevant 
    installations on board a vessel, in particular if required by SOLAS, as well 
    as the issuance of the respective certificates, in particular the Passenger 
    Ship Safety Certificate, fell under the responsibility of this authority. 
    SOLAS requires that the necessary surveys and inspections of ships to enforce 
    the provisions of the present Regulations shall be carried out by the authorities 
    of the country in which the ship is or will be registered. It is possible, 
    however, that these duties may be delegated to surveyors or organisations 
    recognised by the respective government which, nevertheless, remains responsible 
    for the performance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the light of this 
    possibility to delegate and the development of the National Maritime Administrations 
    of the Nordic countries after the war, i.e. also of the Finnish Board of Navigation 
    (F.B.N.), it became an established practice that the respective Classification 
    Society of a newbuilding designated for Finnish owners - in addition to their 
    original duties as Classification Society - also carried out all structure 
    related calculations and surveys and subsequently issued the respective certificates 
    on behalf of the National Administration or supplied the data on the basis 
    of which the Administration then issued the certificates. Such practice was, 
    as such, followed by most Maritime Administrations in co-operation with the 
    recognised classification societies. The co-operation is sometimes performed 
    on basis of specific contracts, e.g. Estonian National Maritime Board/Bureau 
    Veritas or just by a letter of confirmation from the National Administration 
    to the Classification Society either in general or in relation to a particular 
    vessel. With regard to the F.B.N., contracts do exist with the respective 
    Classification Society regarding this co-operation, but these contracts are 
    confidential.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the opinion of 
    F.B.N. they were not responsible in 1979/80 and are still not responsible 
    today for the calculation of load requirements of locking devices nor for 
    the SOLAS-conform location of upper extensions of collision bulkheads above 
    bulkhead deck. It is their understanding that this is the responsibility of 
    the Classification Society because both examples are related to the structure 
    of the vessel - which as such is true. Further, according to the F.B.N. it 
    had been agreed already decades ago between the Governments of the North European 
    countries that the recognised classification societies should look after all 
    structure related matters on behalf of the Maritime Administrations as otherwise 
    the Administrations would be forced to build up similar organisations with 
    respective staff, computers, etc., which the classification societies have 
    anyway, and both would have to be paid by the owners. This principal decision 
    was laid down in the Copenhagen Convention 1924 and is - according to the 
    F.B.N. - still applicable. Therefore, they relied on Bureau Veritas in 1979/80 
    to carry out the necessary considerations and calculations, also in respect 
    of SOLAS requirements, in particular with regard to the locking devices (which 
    is denied by Bureau Veritas). As proof that their interpretation is correct, 
    F.B.N. refers to the MARIELLA casualty which occurred in 1985 in their waters, 
    but they were neither informed by owners nor by the Classification Society 
    DnV, nor by the hull underwriters. The VIKING SAGA casualty in 1984 never 
    came to their knowledge until we told them, although also this was a Finnish 
    ferry in Finnish waters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> F.B.N. is convinced 
    that their attitude is correct and that they basically just take care of lifeboat, 
    fire-fighting, and navigational equipment, and leave the rest to the Classification 
    Society. They have indicated that they have written and still write "Letters 
    of Authorisation" to the Classification Societies whom they trust, e.g. to 
    B.V. The last "Letter of Authorisation" is said to have been written to B.V. 
    in 1982. Irrespective of the above, F.B.N. is aware of the fact that the ultimate 
    responsibility for SOLAS matters, including failure of their servants, i.e. 
    also class employees, rests with them. It should in this context however be 
    observed, that also in the Copenhagen Convention it is explicitly stated, 
    that the ultimate responsibility for the supervision of ships' safety matters 
    always remains with the respective National administration. </font></p>

    has to be noted that some of the approval inspections which, according to 
    SOLAS should have been performed by an F.B.N. inspector were carried out by 
    B.V. surveyor Lohmann, who therefore had a double function. When visor and 
    bow ramp were function tested on 19.06.1980, for example, he acted as Load

    had to be assumed that due to the fact that the same procedure had been performed

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As far as the Yard

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the remark just 
    referred to the "Arrangement", i.e. number and placing, and not to the "Dimensioning" 
    of the locking devices and as further it was the intention to use an identical 
    installation to that installed a year before on the near-sister vessel DIANA 
    II, which had been approved by B.V. and Sjöfartsverket, there was no reason 
    for the Yard to do anything, in particular, there was no reason to talk to 
    F.B.N.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead there is apparently no correspondence 
    between the Yard and F.B.N. This issue had been clarified beforehand between 
    the owners and F.B.N., and it was confirmed by Director Valkonen that the 
    bow ramp was considered to be the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck, although located too much forward. This was allegedly 
    permissible according to SOLAS since the intended trade would allow the vessel 
    to stay within 20 nm off the nearest land and under such conditions it was 
    within the discretion of the Maritime Administration to exempt the owners 
    from otherwise mandatory obligations. This however required the issuance of 
    an exemption certificate by F.B.N., which apparently was not done and reportedly 
    also not customary in those years (see page 84).</font></p>

    the Yard and owners that »bow and stern ramps' arrangement same as on DIANA

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»No 
    partial collision door required for the intended trade by F.B.N.«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the location 
    of the bow ramp, being the upper extension of the collision bulkhead, was 
    in line with the B.V. Rules and F.B.N. - having received all relevant drawings 
    - did not raise objections either - there was thus no reason for the Yard 
    to have doubts that this construction would not be in line with the SOLAS 
    requirements for the intended trade. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After delivery, F.B.N. 
    issued a temporary Passenger Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.55.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    2.4.4.55 </a>(Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.56.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.56</a> (English) - for the voyage from Papenburg to Mariehamn without 
    passengers, which was valid until 20 July 1980.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the vessel 
    came to Turku for the first time, the responsible F.B.N. Director H.Valkonen 
    and the F.B.N. surveyor from Kotka, Gunnar Peippo, marked on a respective 
    drawing all parts of the vessel not to be used by passengers and limited the 
    number of passengers to 700. They further stated that the 20 nm limit was 
    valid until the vessel was fully completed. At a subsequent meeting on 19.07.80 
    it was decided that the vessel was now completed and the first permanent PSSC 
    was issued - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.57.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.57</a> (Finnish/Swedish) and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.58.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.58</a> (English) - however, restricted to "Kustfart mellan Finland och 
    Sverige", i.e. "coastal trade between Finland and Sweden". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The PSSC was issued 
    in two different versions, i.e.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) in Finnish/Swedish 
    language which was considered to be the original. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) in English 
    language for foreigners.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The English 
    wording is to be considered as a translation only.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the PSSC the 
    F.B.N. confirmed the following:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the vessel 
    could be employed for "short international voyages" as defined in SOLAS 1974, 
    Chapter 3 - Lifesaving Appliances, etc. Regulation 2 - Definition:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Short international 
      voyage signifies an international voyage in the course of which a ship is 
      not more than 200 miles from a port or place where the passengers and crew 
      could be placed in safety, and which does not exceed 600 miles in length 
      between the last port of call in the country where the voyage begins and 
      the final port of destination.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the vessel complied 
    with <i>»the requirements of the Regulations annexed to the said Convention 
    as regards: 1. the structure ..«.</i><br>
    - the vessel may carry 2000 passengers »i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige« 
    which means translated: "in coastal trade between Finland and Sweden." Actually 
    the respective (wrong) wording in the English certificates is: »For a short 
    international voyage between Finland and Sweden«. This later led to considerable 
    confusion because in particular the media only received the English version 
    and interpreted the term "short international voyage" in this context as a 
    reference to the SOLAS regulation cited above, which is wrong. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst<i> "short 
    international voyage"</i> refers to SOLAS Chapter 3 "Lifesaving Appliances, 
    etc.", the term "Kustfart" is a trading limit defined by the F.B.N. in their 
    letter of 27 June 1995 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.4.59 </a>- as <i>"not south of Latitude 59°30'N"</i>, which again is wrong. 
    The term <i>"Kustfart"</i> appears only in the Finnish <i>"Statute on Officers 
    on Merchant Vessels 522/1964".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This statute governs 
    the number of and the competence of officers onboard merchant vessels. Under 
    section 2 the types of vessels are defined as well as the trading areas for 
    purposes of this statute. E.g. by the coastal trade/"kustfart" is, according 
    to section 2, item 8 understood "trade outside the inner trading area on the 
    Gulf of Finland as far as 23 degrees long, and on the Gulf of Bothnia and 
    in the Baltic up to lat. 59 degrees 30 and trading within the Swedish Archipelago 
    up to Söderköping". This statute comprises a number of general and specific 
    rules (chapters 1 and 5), and also detailed rules on the certificates of engine 
    and deck officers (chapters 2 and 3). Under chapter 4, the number of and the 
    competence of deck officers is governed. E.g., under section 24 it is in very 
    detail established what the number and competence of the deck officers onboard 
    a vessel in coastal trade (kustfart) is. However, the statute does not refer 
    to the vessel itself. The narrow scope of application of the statute is also 
    described under section 40, which stipulates what pieces of legislation are 
    cancelled by means of this new statute. Not a single statute referring to 
    the construction, seaworthiness, equipment etc. of vessels is mentioned under 
    that section. Consequently it has to be concluded that the definition "kustfart", 
    "coastal trade" as mentioned in the PSSC is actually based on section 2, item 
    8 of the "statute on ship's officers 522/1964" and that the explanation given 
    by F.B.N. in its letter signed by Mr. Jukka Häkämies (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.4.59.htm" target="_blank">enclosure 
    2.4.4.59</a>) clearly refers to this same section, comprising the definition 
    of "kustfart" "as not south of latitude N 59 deg. 30 min". A similar definition 
    is not to be found in any other pieces of legislation pertaining to vessels 
    or navigation, there is not even a reference to coastal trade in such legislation. 
    This definition is not based on a possible exemption as per Chapter II, Regulation 
    1 c) of the at the time with regard to Finnish vessels applicable SOLAS 1960 
    Convention.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is another 
    matter that the F.B.N. later in the above letter, is alleging that the background 
    of "kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" would somehow be the exemption rule 
    of the SOLAS convention. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking 
    upon the application of a definition comprised in various statutes, a general 
    principle is that a certain definition is only applicable on matters regulated 
    by a law comprising that specific definition. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly, the 
    statute itself restricts the application of the definitions of that particular 
    statute solely to the scope of application of the statue itself, that is on 
    matters relating to number and competence of a vessel's officers. Therefore, 
    the restricted trading area "kustfart", "coastal trade" has only been issued 
    and it can only be used in matters relating to the number and competence of 
    the officers onboard that is in connection with matters regulated by the statute 
    of 1964. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The trading 
    area "coastal trade between Sweden and Finland" (i kustfart mellan Sverige 
    och Finland) has not been issued due to the construction of or particulars 
    affecting the construction of the vessel but solely due to the composition 
    of the crew, that is the restricted number of officers onboard. It only means 
    that when the vessel is trading in coastal trade between Sweden and Finland 
    - which it did - it has to be manned as per section 24 of the statute on ship's 
    officers. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus, the restriction 
    "coastal trade" does not relate to the construction of the vessel, however, 
    if it is assumed that this particular restriction was intended to refer to 
    the construction of the vessel, i.e. that the F.B.N. when issuing the certificate 
    would have found that the vessel was only safe in coastal trade between Sweden 
    and Finland, the conclusion would then be that the FBN should have made a 
    respective remark in the PSSC which doubtless would have led to re-inspecting 
    the vessel in case the trading area would be changed. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated in 
    Subchapter 2.2 and as it has been confirmed by the SOLAS experts of Germanischer 
    Lloyd it was common practice in those years for the National Maritime Authorities 
    not to issue "Exemption Certificates", but that a respective handwritten remark 
    by the inspector in the vessel's file was sufficient. In addition, however, 
    this remark, that the trading area was restricted to "sheltered waters - 20 
    nm", should have been made in the PSSC as well, which could have been the 
    case by the entry "i kustfart mellan Finland och Sverige".<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It may thus 
    be concluded that the F.B.N. issued the PSSC - after receipt of copies of 
    the class certificates - in accordance with common practice in those years, 
    i.e. it confirmed by the PSSC that the vessel complied with the SOLAS requirements, 
    however, restricted the trade to "Kustfart mellan Sverige och Finland" = "coastal 
    trade between Finland and Sweden". This should have ended, however, when the 
    issuance of "exemption certificates" became mandatory in 1985/86 and copies 
    had to be sent to IMO. At the latest then the F.B.N. should have issued an 
    "Exemption Certificate" in respect of the wrong location of the bow ramp as 
    upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck (cardeck) and 
    should have sent a copy to IMO in London as also required by SOLAS. This was 
    not done. Even when the trading area was changed to the middle of the Gulf 
    of Bothnia and the vessel's name was changed to WASA KING, the F.B.N. continued 
    to issue the same PSSC's even though the vessel had left the "sheltered waters" 
    on the leg Sundsvall-Vaasa when she was regularly more than 20 nm from the 
    nearest land, thus the granting of exemptions was no more permissible according 
    to SOLAS and the F.B.N. should have required the installation of a "partial 
    collision door" or similar in way of the proper location required by SOLAS 
    for the "the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck". 
    Also this was not done and the vessel kept sailing in the same condition as 
    delivered by her builders in 1980 and with the same worded PSSC as first issued 
    in 1980. This was the situation when the vessel was sold in January 1993.
