<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Bureau Veritas 
    inspected the vessel for compliance with the class requirements in accordance 
    with their rules and standards. The main inspection period was five years 
    and the 1500 items to be inspected were divided into approximately 300 items 
    to be inspected each year according to the Continuous Survey Programme of 
    Bureau Veritas. The bow area under this programme was inspected in 1983, 1988 
    and in 1993. No discrepancies were recorded during any of these inspections. 
    The question remains why the severe deficiencies of the visor and the bow 
    ramp which clearly existed already in 1993 were not recorded. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the available 
    documentation it has to be assumed that the two B.V. people responsible for 
    the ESTONIA, both from a classification and statutory point of view, Hans 
    Olsson, manager of BV-Sweden, and Anders Wirstam, staff surveyor of the BV-Stockholm 
    office and exclusively involved with ESTONIA, were not interrogated by Joint 
    Accident Investigation Commission and there is no recorded evidence in the 
    files of the Swedish part of this Commission about their interrogations by 
    the police and the prosecutor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In a memo found in 
    the files of the prosecutor the following is, however, stated: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On 12.10.1994 
      at 12.10 hours I had contact with the manager of B.V. in Gothenburg, Hans 
      Olsson, Tel. (031) 17 14 15. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      subject was which surveys they had done on the "Estonia". All the relevant 
      documentation was with them; Olsson stated that he could not submit any 
      documents without the respective authority. In case he should have to do 
      so, he would need the approval partly from N&T, partly from the Estonian 
      Government.<br>
      Olsson even wishes to inform the lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson by telephone 
      (08) 665 90 70. This lawyer protects them legally. <br>
      Olsson also advised that Olof Forssberg from the Commission had already 
      given the same explanation as the police now give. Forssberg raised the 
      same questions which the police are now asking. Olsson knew that Forssberg 
      had been in contact with the owners in this matter, N&T had been in contact 
      with Olsson and they will send a letter with what Forssberg wants to know. 
      <br>
      The documentation concerning "Estonia" consists of a large number of A4 
      folders. <br>
      Olsson requires a written statement from the police with the documents they 
      are demanding. Before this the police have to contact N&T - S.M. (Sven Malmroos).<br>
      In the course of the further development I managed to contact sometimes 
      the prosecutor and sometimes Forssberg.<br>
      Some co-ordination has to be found. / S.M. (Sven Malmroos).«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that 
    B.V. apparently enjoyed some special treatment as did N&T and ESCO, which 
    continued throughout the investigation up-to-date. Reportedly Hans Olsson 
    left B.V. in the summer of 1998 and might thus be willing to give some explanations 
    now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The files of the 
    prosecutor reveal that Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam were interrogated together 
    for the first time on 21.11.1994 by the criminal inspectors L.E. Andersson 
    and S.A. Wranding. On 02.06.1997 Hans Olsson was questioned alone by the criminal 
    inspector Bo Wide and thereafter Anders Wirstam was questioned again and alone 
    on 22.01.1998 also by Bo Wide and Tomas Lindstrand. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> interrogated by 
    public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand and the police inspector Bo Wide in the 
    presence of lawyer Olof Rågmark of Johnsson & Johnson:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - 28 years experience 
    as marine engineer. <br>
    - first contact when vessel was still WASA KING.<br>
    - had also known DIANA II very well for a long time. - he did not know that 
    the ramp was in wrong place according to SOLAS<br>
    - no measurements in this respect had been made, neither at time of flag change 
    nor newbuilding.<br>
    - regarding the <i>"short international voyage"</i> he is of the opinion that 
    the vessel must not be more than <b>100 nm </b>from land, which was not the 
    case with ESTONIA. <br>
    - discussion of the <b>100 nm</b> limit - the lawyer stated that nowhere in 
    the Baltic could you be more than 100 nm from land.<br>
    - upon being questioned about the <b>20 nm</b> limit Wirstam stated that he 
    could not answer the question. - What checks did he perform before signing 
    the PSSC? Safety equipment/radio equipment, etc. The inspection took three 
    weeks including visor, bow ramp, locking devices. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    - T. Lindstrand asked, whether he wanted to say anything in this respect?<br>
    Wirstam: <i>"No, I did not concentrate on visor and bow ramp very much." <br>
    </i>Lindstrand asked again, whether there was anything in respect of visor 
    and bow ramp that was noteworthy or strange?<br>
    Wirstam: <i>"No." <br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: Did you see the Finnish PSSC?<br>
    Wirstam: <i>"Yes."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: What did you do in 3 weeks? Did you look at drawings, did 
    you check whether anything was changed?<br>
    Wirstam:<i> "One sees how the vessel is built. One asks the crew. If nobody 
    says that the vessel had been modified, one takes it that it has not been.<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand concludes that the check is just made by looking at the vessel 
    and asking questions to people who are believed to have knowledge about the 
    vessel. <br>
    - Lindstrand: Did DIANA II sail in sheltered waters between Rostock/ Trelleborg?<br>
    Wirstam: <i>"Well within 100 nm, I don't know whether within 20 nm." <br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Lindstrand: 
    What importance did the ramp position have for the cause of the casualty?<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Wirstam: "No 
    importance. This is difficult to answer. It is outside my scope of evaluation. 
    Do you mean that it should be further aft?"</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Lindstrand: Yes, 
    and also if it had been constructed differently without the ramp extending 
    into the ramp house?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Wirstam:<i> "This 
    has now fortunately been forbidden and therefore the conclusion has to be 
    drawn that it cannot have been that good. But there are still many ferries 
    which have the ramp built in into the visor."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: Do you consider the ramp to be the upper extension of the 
    collision bulkhead in accordance with SOLAS?<br>
    Wirstam:<i> "Yes, this was the case."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: B.V. carried out the Flag State Control?<br>
    Wirstam:<i> "Yes."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: Refers again in detail to the distance between ramp / f.p.p. 
    What did you do? Why didn't you know?<br>
    Wirstam: <i>"No."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: Was it normal not to care about this? <br>
    Wirstam: <i>"Yes, we trusted the previous administration."<br>
    </i>- Lindstrand: Did you assume that the vessel had been correctly built 
    at the beginning? <br>
    Wirstam: <i>"This is part of my job. On the other hand, I was not alone. There 
    was also Hans Olsson.<br>
    </i> Wirstam: <i>"I was from 1966-1969 with Sjöfartsverket, Stockholm. <br>
    </i>- Lindstrand draws attention to the German findings of the visor's misalignment. 
    Was this checked? <br>
    Wirstam: <i>"When an inspection is carried out it is expected that the vessel 
    is in a certain condition. If this would have been the case, it should have 
    been visible. During inspection you look at the opening and closing of the 
    visor. If nothing is visible, it is o.k."</i></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) According 
      to a memo by Sven Malmroos, investigating police inspector during the early 
      days, he was advised on 12.10.1994 by Eva Lindström from the Sjöfartsverket 
      head office that two operative controls had been carried out by them, one 
      at the beginning of 1993 (during take-over) and another one at the beginning 
      of 1994, which is unknown unless they mean the RITS exercise on 01.02.1994, 
      which was actually a bomb exercise and not an operative control. The memo 
      of Sven Malmroos is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.3.137.htm" target="_blank"> 
      Enclosure 9.3.137.</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) According 
      to the JAIC there had been four inspections: the take-over inspection, which 
      had to be considered a Port State Control (PSC) inspection, - see Subchapter 
      6.5.2 - and three further PSC inspections during the following 20 months. 
      One was supposed to have been carried out in connection with an oil spill 
      caused by leaking stern-tube seals already in April 1993, another one was 
      supposed to have been in December 1993 and the final one was said to have 
      been in March 1994 which allegedly did not give rise to any remark. See 
      the JAIC Report - Subchapter 3.2.10. The JAIC reports further in Subchapter 
      5.3: "During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme 
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port 
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on 
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough 
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed 
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise 
      was documented in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. 
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement.<br>
      The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by the 
      Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and very 
      well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused detention 
      or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular Port State 
      Control." </font></p>

      take-over in Tallinn on 01.02.93, followed by two oil spills on 02.04.93 
      and 06.04.93, and another two in December 1993 and in March 1994 which are 
      unknown. The RITS Exercise is not included. Actually Ulf Beijner, then the 
      head of the Sjöfartsverket's Shipinspec office in Stockholm, confirmed to 
      a member of this 'Group of Experts' and the safety inspector, Peter Hoffsten, 
      confirmed to Tommy Lindström, who investigated the matter on behalf of the 
      relatives organisation SEA, that they had never carried out a real PSC inspection. 
      The report of Tommy Lindström is attached in English as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.1.136.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      9.3.136 </a>and in Swedish as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.3.136.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure
