        films will not be shown to the public until the commission has completed 
        its analysis carefully and quietly. <br>

        The commission has finalized the taking of statements from the survivors. 
        On Friday they concentrated on collecting all thinkable information which 
        might have a relation to the casualty. There is eyewitness evidence drawing 
        the investigators' attention to the bow door. However Lethola does not 
        exclude completely the possibility that the cargo might have shifted. 
        "The many reports about banging noises from the car deck could indicate 
        that the cargo did move", Lethola replied. <br>

        In Finnish newspapers it was reported on Saturday (01.10.94) that 'Estonia' 
        may have had problems already one hour before finally the alarm was transmitted. 
        The vessel may have deviated from her normal course and may have had problems 
        with manoeuvring as well as with establishing the position and for a full 
        hour deviated from her normal course. <br>
        The Finnish JAIC member, Kari Lethola, denied very determinedly that the 
        JAIC should work with such a theory. According to Lethola there was no 
        "normal" route for the 'Estonia'. <br>
        "Vessels do not always move on the direct line between two positions. 
        Good seamanship requires the selection of the most advantageous route", 
        said Lethola. <br>
        "There are no indications that 'Estonia' should have deviated from her 
        course or should have had problems establishing her position already that 
        long time before the catastrophe. The misunderstanding was probably initiated 
        by the vessel having been one hour behind schedule ... ."</i></font></p>

        Water from the car deck penetrated the cabins on deck 1 below ... <br>
        This was reported to the JAIC by the watch A.B. Silver Linde.<br>

        something had happened deep down in the vessel. <br>
        <b>Note: </b>A passenger cannot phone the bridge. Silver Linde was sent 
        down at once. Down on the lower decks he met passengers rushing up and

        however, the 'Estonia' heeled and took a heavy list." ... "At about the

        the engine control room. On a monitor they saw water streaming past the

        It is hoped, however, that the video films from the wreck will allow this.

        who analysed the sonar pictures taken when 'Estonia' was located, could 
        give them on Sunday a new interpreta-tion. According to Nuorteva the vessel

        Estonia's President, Lennart Meri, is fully prepared to exchange the Estonian

        in the joint investigation of the 'Estonia' casualty. <b>There must not 
        remain the slightest doubt that Estonia wants complete certainty about 
        the catastrophe.</b>"<br>
        This was stated by the President in an interview last Sunday in Stockholm 
        ... <br>
        The 65 year old President has taken it very personally that there was 
        so much mistrust against the Estonian crew and the Estonian JAIC members 
        expressed recently by several Finnish and Swedish civil servants. <br>
        He listened politely to the questions, nodded but did not want to become 
        polemical about them. He said slowly, very slowly and with very much self-control 
        after having pointed to all the flags outside the hotel being put on half-mast: 
        <br>
        &quot;There was the best trained personnel one can think of on the 'Estonia'. 
        They did their work exemplarily and did everything to avoid that panic 
        broke out. Captain Arvo Andresson, this experienced sailor, stood all 
        the time on his bridge and never left it. He followed the vessel also 
        into the depth. Everything went so fast."<br>
        The last days had added doubts about the Estonian Transport Minister Andi 
        Meister as chairman of the JAIC. Among other things the Swedish sea safety 
        experts questioned his competence. <br>
        "In this context I can only say that in case there should be indications 
        of a conflict of interest for any Estonian person, we shall exchange him", 
        Lennart Meri replied.<br>

        He pointed out spontaneously that he himself had appointed a personal 
        representative (for the JAIC), who, with his 40 years in the sailor profession, 
        stood for competence and experience. He has the President's full confidence 
        and he is member of the JAIC.<br>

        Visor Broken Away Evidence of catastrophic failure as submersible finds

        By Jim Muluran, Shipping Editor<br>
        Sonar images of the wreck of the 'Estonia' last night suggested the ferry 
        may have sustained catastrophic damage to her bow doors. Pictures transmitted 
        to the Finnish government vessel "HALLI" from an unmanned submersible 
        suggested the visor bow door was lying 15 m from the hull. The underwater 
        survey tended to confirm fears that the failure of the outer visor may 
        have caused the casualty. There was still no indication as to whether 
        there had also been a devastating failure of the inner watertight doors." 
        </i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Turku on 
      this and the following day and viewed the video material produced by the 
      ROVs from the "HALLI". It has to be assumed that it was then decided that 
      the visor had to be considered "not yet found", although somebody must have 
      told Lloyd's List before that the visor had been found. The reasons for 
      such a tactical manoeuvre are obvious: The visor next to the wreck implies 
      a longer sequence of events and rules out a rapid development undetected 
      by the crew until it was too late. The visor close to the wreck also rules 
      out the possibility that the visor might have pulled open the bow ramp when 
      the vessel was still at full speed or, at least, making headway. </font></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Film Pictures 
        Show the Visor to Have Been Torn Off </b><br>
        Video pictures show that the whole visor was torn off 'Estonia' ... and 
        that the watertight ramp at its inside was about 1 m open. Therefore the 
        car deck became quickly water-filled and the vessel capsized. .... The 
        experts cannot say whether a heavy wave or fatigue of the material have 
        caused the catastrophe. The video pictures demon-strate without doubt 
        that is possible on a modern ferry that the whole visor weighing many 
        tons can simply be torn off. This could be the explanation for the 2 bangs 
        many survivors have heard. ...<br>
        The visor was pushed upwards with such force that it broke loose from 
        its hydraulic locking devices and left big holes in the steel plates. 
        ... <br>
        The visor has still not been found although ROVs have been used in addition. 
        The reason for this is certainly that the visor fell off more than on 
        hour before the vessel sank. The bow ramp is in position but its locking 
        devices are also damaged. The bow ramp has to ascertain/maintain watertightness 
        even if the visor is damaged, however, it is about 1 m open. The JAIC 
        draws the conclusion that the water quantities which ingressed through 
        the open ramp were sufficient for the vessel to loose the stability and 
        to capsize. <br>
        Why the visor was torn off and why also the locking devices of the bow 
        ramp are damaged the JAIC cannot say for the time being. "We need time 
        for us to find the answers why the visor became loose", said Olof Forssberg. 
        According to Forssberg this could be for example a heavy wave, too high 
        speed under the prevailing conditions and too high load.<br>
        The JAIC members warned not to draw conclusions with regard to other car/passenger 
        ferries. They would now investigate whether the 'Estonia's' construction 
        would deviate from the construction of other comparable ferries. According 
        to naval architect Börje Stenström, JAIC member, it is already clear that 
        the ferry traffic shall have to face serious consequences even if the 
        answer to the question what caused the casualty should not be found. <br>
        "It has to be emphasized that the Atlantic lock of the 'Estonia', which 
        is an additional locking device for heavy weather, had been engaged," 
        said Stenström. <br>
        Failure of Material Far-fetched <br>
        Stenström does not want to speculate completely about the causes why the 
        lock mechanism failed, however, he stated that failure of the material 
        seemed to be far-fetched. "Then you may rather imagine overload." <br>
        Technology Doctor T. Karppinen ... stated that the sea state had influenced 
        the tearing off of the visor. According to Karppinen the pictures of the 
        open bow ramp did support the reports of two engineers that water ingressed 
        through the bow ramp. That they had seen on a monitor."</i></font></p>

        Supports Video Film </b><br>
        Six days after the catastrophe the only surviving officer having been 
        on duty spoke at a press conference in Tallinn. The 3rd engineer and watch-keeper 
        Margus Treu was in the engine room of the vessel at the time of the casualty. 
        In the case that his evidence is true it is once and forever established 
        that "Estonia's" sinking was caused by the tearing loose of the bow visor. 
        <br>
        In spite of Treu being an experienced sailor it was difficult for him 
        to explain what actually happened. <br>
        - "At 01.00 hrs. I saw on my monitor in the engine room that an AB sailor 
        went his control round and that he was just forward at the bow ramp." 
        <br>
        This information, however, does not conform with the statement that AB 
        sailor Silver Linde made during earlier interrogation by the Commission. 
        Linde testified there that he had completed his round already at 00.30 
        hrs. by turning a control key behind the bow ramp. <br>
        <b>Heard Hard Bangs</b> <br>
        Between 01.12 and 01.15 Margus Treu heard 2 to 3 strong bangs in the vessel. 
        <br>
        "These were not the waves. They did not sound like from waves even if 
        the waves are very strong. I thought that trucks had started to move and 
        crashed against the shell plating." <br>
        He switched his monitor to the effect that he could see the truck. Thereafter 
        he changed the camera and had a look at the bow area. "There I saw that 
        water rushed onto the car deck. Then the vessel had already taken a list. 
        Simultaneously the mate called from the bridge asking: "Can we restore 
        the balance of the vessel again?" Treu tried to pump water over to the 
        other side which failed. The mate asked again: <br>
        "Is it possible to pump out freshwater to regain the balance?" Treu replied: 
        <br>
        "This is not possible, this is technically impossible." <br>
        <b>The Engines Were Running </b><br>
        He also denied information that the engines had stopped long before the 
        vessel sank. No water entered the engine room as long as he was there.<br>
        "At 01.25 hrs. I tried to start the port one but it failed. The starboard 
        engines kept running for some minutes more. Then they also stopped." <br>
        <b>Washed into the Sea</b><br>
        Thereafter he crept up to the 8th deck and pulled himself to the aft just 
        when the sinking was interrupted.<br>
        - "Then I was washed into the sea by a giant wave. I succeeded in pulling 
        myself up into a lifeboat."<br>
        From there he saw that the bow visor had disappeared when "Estonia" disappeared 
        into the deep. <br>
        <b>After the press conference Margus Treu criticised the interrogations 
        by the Estonian police. The Estonians went very far with their ambitions 
        to clarify the causes for the casualty.</b><br>
        On Friday (30 September, i.e. 2 days after the casualty) all passenger 
        lists and Estline's complete documentation concerning "Estonia" were confiscated 
        by the Estonian Security Police. <br>
        Note: On 5 October N&T declared the withdrawal from the Stockholm-Tallinn 
        ferry service (which remained a decla-ration only for the years to come 
        because they continued until 1998). On Monday, 03.10., also Sten-Christer 
        Forsberg, technical director of N&T, went very far when he strongly attacked 
        the Swedish Ship Engineers' Association: <br>
        - "Their categorical allegations against the Estonian engine room crew 
        is shameless and insulting. The purpose is to make use of the situation

        Such a theory can be found in the investigation material of the Tallinn 
        police according to the experience of SvD made in Tallinn.</i></b><i> 
        However according to mate Einar Kukk, who was trainee onboard the 'Estonia', 
        those in command on the bridge did not receive any information that this 
        should have been the case. Kukk was on the bridge between 20.20 hrs. and 
        00.40 hrs. local time. "During this time a possible failure of the visor 
        was not discussed", said Einar Kukk to SvD. The Tallinn police have interrogated 
        58 survivors, of whom 33 are crew members. Many of them state that they 
        heard a distinct metallic noise before 'Estonia' got the list. "But none 
        of them took the view that this resulted from a collision", said the investigator 
        Väino Karmi. The investigation by the police, which runs parallel with 
        the investigations by the International Commission and the Swedish police, 
        indicates that the theory about sabotage can be probably written off. 
        "No such information did come up", said V. Karmi. He is upset about accusations 
        that the Estonian security police did try to hide important witnesses. 
        "When the survivors of the catastrophe arrived at Tallinn Airport we guided 
        them away from the intensive shadowing by the media. Even you journalists 
        have to understand that people having just escaped a tragedy should not 
        be exposed to questions." <br>
        <b>Fraud with Cargo Weights </b><br>
        Väino Karmi is well acquainted with MV 'Estonia' since the Tallinn police 
        initiated an investigation into fraud with cargo weights earlier this 
        year. The trigger off factor was the smuggling of 64 Kurds who were hidden 
        in a Swedish truck. Karmi is of the opinion that many freight forwarders 
        systematically stated lower values to avoid high customs fees. "Each time 
        the Estonian customs made spot checks they found wrong declarations." 
        SvD did scrutinise the "Estonia's" cargo manifest. The 39 trucks contained 
        everything from furniture and timber to frozen fish and fashion clothes. 
        Two trucks were declared empty, but the Tallinn police has no confirmation 
        of some rumours that refugees should have been onboard. <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There were actually 40 trucks onboard. <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">See

        <b>Trainee Mate </b><br>
        Mate Einar Kukk was onboard the 'Estonia' to gain practical experience 
        before taking up his normal duty as 2nd mate on "Estonia's" sister vessel 
        'Vironia,' the previous 'Diana II'. 'Vironia' shall take up the traffic 
        at the beginning of November. Kukk reports about the last hours onboard: 
        <br>
        - "I left the bridge at 00.40 hrs. Then everything was under control. 
        I went to bed just before 01.00 hrs. After ca. 5 minutes I heard a strange 
        noise which I had never heard before at sea." <br>
        Kukk went up to see what happened. When he was still in his cabin the 
        vessel started to heel over seriously. Kukk's statements also indicates 
        that 'Estonia' took a list already 30-35 minutes before the casualty.

        After the visor broke off the 'Estonia' was doomed if the vessel was not 
        turned rather quickly which was not done." That's the way Tuomo Karppinen 
        expressed himself. The JAIC came out with a preliminary report about what 
        caused the casualty after their meeting in Turku on Tuesday. <br>
        According to the JAIC the casualty one week ago had been caused by water 
        on the car deck which ingressed via the forward ramp. Why the visor broke 
        loose is not explained. The JAIC declared that it could have been caused 
        by fatigue as well as by one single overload of the locking devices. Thereafter 
        the visor broke off and the inner bow ramp was exposed to such wave loads 
        that the locking devices gradually gave way and the ramp opened some meters. 
        <br>
        This had been sufficient to take in so much water on to the car deck that 
        the vessel became unstable, heeled to starboard and capsized. How fast 
        this developed after the visor broke off the JAIC is unable to say.<br>
        <b>One A4 Page</b><br>
        It is also unknown "which information about the immediate danger did exist 
        on the bridge", as they expressed themselves. One A4 page with short factual 
        comments is all that the JAIC has achieved so far in the investigation 
        of the human tragedy without comparison in Europe after the war. <br>
        Many of the experts and members of the JAIC to whom DN spoke did agree 
        in one matter: It is considered to be more or less impossible that ferry 
        proceeded on against the prevailing sea conditions with the 15000 ts heavy 
        ferry without noting that the visor and also parts of the foreship were 
        torn/broken off. <br>
        "They should have seen from the bridge that the visor had disappeared", 
        said T. Karppinen. <br>
        "It is for me not understandable that one can proceed against 8-10 m high 
        waves without noting that the visor has disappeared", said Sten Anderson 
        who has sailed as master for 17 years and is now observer for Sjöfartsverket 
        to the JAIC. <br>
        "It is very difficult to understand that they proceeded on without visor 
        for another hour", said Börje Stenström. <br>
        All these comments mean subliminally that those in charge on the bridge 
        after midnight were not competent. Another possibility is that the visor 
        was torn off and the inner ramp damaged by one single wave which did not 
        give the watch officer time to react. <br>
        <b>Different Versions</b><br>
        The statements from the surviving crew members, however, do not confirm 
        the above version of a development within seconds after which the vessel 
        was doomed to capsize. The JAIC's hearing of the crew did clearly reveal 
        that the watch A.B. Silver Linde made his last watch round at 23.30 hours 
        Swedish time. At this time he had turned a key which confirms that he 
        did make his round. Then he heard a loud bang from the ramp and had to 
        hold himself fast not to be knocked off his feet on the car deck. He did 
        nevertheless not draw the conclusion that something dangerous had occurred 
        as the vessel continued to pitch in the heavy seas. Exactly this indicates 
        that what Linde heard was a part of the casualty scenario: He was used 
        from many times before to holding himself against the vessel's move-ments 
        and would not have paid attention unless something special occurred. <br>
        <b>"Everything normal". </b><br>
        When he came to the bridge half an hour later there were the 2nd and the 
        4th mate. At the same time also Captain Arvo Andresson appeared. According 
        to Linde everything was normal on the bridge. Thereafter the phone rang 
        and somebody advised that there was something wrong down in the vessel. 
        Apparently now large quantities of water were penetrating. <br>
        Only 24 minutes after Linde and the master came up to the bridge the emergency 
        call "Mayday" was sent. About 20 minutes later the vessel disappeared 
        from the radar screen of "Mariella". If the heavy bang heard by Silver 
        Linde on the car deck at 23.30 hrs. had been caused by the breaking off 
        of the visor, the vessel must have proceeded on for at least half an hour 
        without bow visor and also without those on the bridge noting what had 
        happened. Ab-solutely clear is that the master really tried to save his 
        vessel after he understood what had happened, it is however unclear when 
        this was. <br>
        - The pictures from the wreck show that the rudders are almost on hard 
        astarboard and the propellers are in a position indicating that the speed 
        had been reduced, said Tuomo Karppinen. It is, however, unclear when this 
        manoeuvre was made and how long the speed had been reduced. Sten Andersson 
        pointed to the fact that the reducing of speed in the prevailing wind 
        and sea conditions was the only professional way to handle the vessel. 
        <br>
        - However none of the surviving crew members from the engine room talk 
        about speed reduction for any longer period of time. It is extremely important 
        to adjust the speed, this is of particular importance for a vessel with 
        bow visor. According to Sten Andersson the crew "did not judge the circum-stances 
        properly" during that night. Karl-Johan Hagman drew attention to the fact 
        that Estonian vessels with 'Estonia's' engine power are unusual.<br>
        - The crew probably did not realize how dangerous it is to proceed with 
        full output of 24000 hp against the heavy waves, an output that was needed 
        to break half meter thick ice. <br>
        If the visor should be found near the wreck everything points to a very 
        quick development. The visor then broke loose shortly before the vessel 
        took such a list that all 4 main engines stopped due to lack of oil pressure. 
        <br>
        If, however, the visor should be found a longer distance away from the 
        wreck, this would indicate that the vessel proceeded for some time against 
        the heavy waves without visor. The competence of the crew has to be questioned. 
        Then the JAIC's chairman, the <b>Estonian Andi Meister</b>, does not believe 
        anything of this at all:<br>
        <b>- According to my opinion the catastrophe was caused by a material 
        failure. "I cannot blame the crew".</b><br>
        </i><b>Note:</b> When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe on 01.05.97 Andi 
        Meister stated among other things that "the JAIC had decided to use this 
        casualty to set an example by teach-ing the shipbuilding industry a lesson." 
        This required a casualty scenario permitting a cause consideration pointing 
        to the shipbuilder, i.e. the building yard - Meyer Werft in Papenburg.

        the ramp moved forward out of a locked position. It has not been possible

        Estonians having to beg for it. <br>
        Priit Männik, Deputy Manager of the Central Intelligence Department of 
        the Estonian police said that he hoped for an improvement during next 
        week. Then the leader of the preliminary inquiry by the Swedish police, 
        Chief Prosecutor Birgitta Cronier, shall come to Tallinn together with 
        several Stockholm police investigators. Männik, a powerful guy ... has 
        his desk in the head office at Piikgatan, where also previously the head 
        office of the KGB had been. <br>
        <b>Difficult to get Information </b><br>
        - It has been difficult to obtain information from Sweden and the Swedish 
        police did not get in contact with us up till now. The Finnish police, 
        however, have been much more active, said Priit Männik. The information 
        he is lacking deals among other things with the passengers who had been 
        on board and who were delivered into Swedish hospitals, with 'Estonia's' 
        technical equipment and with information from the Swedish Shipping Inspection 
        (Sjöfartsverket). <br>
        - We have no access to the Swedish inspection made before the last departure 
        here in Tallinn on 27 September in connection with the training of Estonian 
        inspectors, he said. Transport Minister Andi Meister, chairman of the 
        JAIC, criticised for not having allowed the first hearing of survivors 
        to be performed the way required, said on Wednesday that the Estonians 
        had still not been informed who is in Swedish hospitals although many 
        days have passed since the 'Estonia' casualty. <br>
        <b>Invitation to the Swedish Police</b><br>
        Police chief Männik would like the Swedish police to come to Tallinn and 
        participate in the investigation. He and his investigators have now taken 
        the statements of all 61 Estonian survivors. On Wednes-day they commenced 
        analysing the statements. They are working in accordance with 3 main theories 
        why 'Estonia' could have sank, but Priit Männik is like a clam if he is 
        asked questions in this regard.<br>
        - I have agreed with the JAIC not to go public before their preliminary 
        results are clear. The technical aspects have to be carefully considered 
        in our investigation. Estonia has so far not put forward any suspicion 
        for a criminal offence. <br>
        - According to Männik the witness statements from the surviving Estonians 
        are very contradictory. One of the problems is to find the time when what 
        happened.<br>
        - He sighs about the confusion which continues to exist about who had 
        really been onboard of the 'Estonia' and refuses to state any number: 
        "This is changing every day."</i></font></p>

        Found</b><br>
        The crew of 'Tursas' has found small pieces of metal debris from 'Estonia' 
        when analysing the sonar pictures taken on Thursday.<br>
        - The pieces, however, are so small that they hardly show the way 'Estonia' 
        was drifting. The visor we have still not found, said Kari Lethola. When 
        the search was discontinued on Thursday 'Tursas' had been between 1 and 
        11/2 nm distant from the wreck. During the search 'Tursas' had found a 
        wide ranging area with a very thick layer of mud. ...<br>
        <b>Object Squeezed into Ramp Opening</b><br>
        Films from the wreck show some sort of red material near the open bow 
        ramp through which water ingressed to the car deck. The object looks like 
        a mattress. "This is a mattress which you see on the pictures", said Kari 
        Lethola.<br>
        "We have discussed this and came to the conclusion that something is jammed 
        in at the bow ramp. This detail has to be filmed again."<br>
        "We have studied the drawings and there is a bed-clothing store located 
        right inside the bow ramp." Kari Lethola does not dare to say whether 
        somebody has tried to seal the gap between ramp and bulkhead by means 
        of mattresses or if the mattresses visible on the video film could have 
        floated up and got squeezed in after the vessel sank." </i></font></p>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Damage to Visor 
        Locks is the Main Question </b><br>
        The JAIC is now focusing on the question whether the locking device systems 
        holding visor and bow ramp in place were faulty or damaged.<br>
        "This is one of the main questions we are concentrating upon", said Uno 
        Laur. As soon as the weather permits the 'Suunta' shall send the ROV's 
        down again, this time for a special documentation of the locking devices. 
        The combination of the broken off visor and the open ramp confuse the 
        experts, simultaneously it does point to the locking systems being a weak 
        point in the sequence-of-events. <br>
        "The visor broke off completely or in parts which could have been caused 
        by damaged locks. Thereafter huge water quantities were smashing against 
        the bow ramp, the inner door. This has to be watertight and has strong 
        hydraulic locks.<br>
        According to Johannes Palmgren, expert in Shipinspec., the ramp should 
        withstand the waves, even if the visor should be gone - at least for the 
        time it takes the crew to realize that the visor has disappeared.<br>
        The videos from the sea bottom show that the ramp is about 1 m wide open 
        at the upper side. The gap continues at both sides and narrows continuously. 
        <br>
        "Nowhere do you find an answer to the question why different locking systems 
        failed almost simultaneously", said Uno Laur. On Thursday the experts 
        of the Estonian part of the JAIC com-menced looking at the 16 hours of 
        video film available. SvD received permission to join the marine experts 
        while viewing the videos. <br>
        <b>Sharp pictures.</b><br>
        Remarkably sharp pictures from 'Estonia's' propeller triggered off an 
        intensive discussion. The question what speed was she making on her way 
        to disaster is most relevant. The 15 kn which were the rule in heavy weather 
        could have been too much. Nevertheless, what happened after the crew discovered 
        free floating water on the car deck? <br>
        Was the speed reduced to minimize the water ingress or did it come too 
        late? <br>
        "There are relations between the angles of the propeller blades which 
        indicate the speed of 'Estonia' just before she sank. On the film a rather 
        small angle is visible which indicates rather low speed", said Uno Laur. 
        <br>
        However the picture of the propellers do not say anything about the earlier 
        speed. <b>Most important: Did they lower the speed after 3rd engineer 
        Margus Treu had reported to the bridge that there was water on the car 
        deck just after midnight (Swedish time), i.e. 35-40 minutes before 'Estonia' 
        sank? <br>
        The Angle Controls the Speed.</b> <br>
        - Those in charge on the bridge can reduce the speed directly by changing 
        the angles of the propellers (blades). The engineer has nothing to do. 
        The four main engines can continue with unchanged revolutions, Laur pointed 
        out. It is nowhere documented that those in charge on the bridge actually 
        did reduce the speed after Treu's alarming them, said Laur. The combination 
        of the damaged or torn off visor, open ramp and excessive speed might 
        have been the death sentence for 'Estonia'. <br>
        <b>No Questions from the Owners </b><br>
        The Estonian part of the JAIC, of which Uno Laur is the member directly 
        representing the President has difficulties receiving the required information 
        quickly which is probably due to the politicians trying to influence the 
        investigation heavily. Already on the 29th September they requested drawings, 
        sketches and calculations for different parts of the 'Estonia'. <br>
        After six days, yesterday was Thursday, there was still no reaction. From 
        B.V. the JAIC received a letter on Thursday with the offer to help. The 
        letter was sent by normal mail and was thus only received after 6 days.<br>
        Finally fax contact has been established with Paris and the Estonians 
        have requested all relevant information from the classification society 
        B.V., which surveyed 'Estonia' in the beginning of 1993, which included 
        also the visor and the bow ramp. <br>
        "They are frustrated that nobody has access to the drawings of visor and 
        locking devices", said the marine engineer Heimo Jaakula, one of the Estonian 
        experts and advisors. ..." </i></font></p>

        1. A few technicians of the Swedish and the Finnish parts of the investigation 
        board are visiting the shipyard at Nådendal in Finland on 11 October to 
        study the Diana II, sister ship to Estonia. The visit is primarily for 
        general familiarization, including study of ramp detail. The bow visor 
        is unfortunately welded shut so the visir and ramp function cannot be 
        examined in detail." <br>
        Forssberg then continued with other matters: "<br>
        2. We understand from newspaper articles from Tallinn that you are disturbed 
        by Nordström & Thulin not providing you with desired technical information.

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In response Pedak advised 
      by phone that two professors from the Tallinn University would also attend

      would supply them with the required documentation. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In summary of the information 
      submitted so far on the previous pages, it can be concluded that the Finns 
      and Swedes co-operated quite closely in matters concerning the wreck, the 
      visor and whatever else might have been on the bottom of the sea in this 
      area, however without informing the Estonians at all. On the other hand, 
      the Estonians did withhold information, at least as long as possible, in 
      all matters throwing a bad light on the ferry, the crew and/or the E.N.M.B. 
      and the ESCO/Estline organisations including possible explosions onboard. 
      Thus already from the very beginning the JAIC was split into two groups 
      of interest, i.e. the Finns and Swedes on the one side and the Estonians 
      on the other, and it is quite obvious that it would be most advantageous 
      for both sides if a casualty scenario and a cause consideration could be 
      found which was simple to understand, close to reality and which did not 
      affect the interest spheres of any of the three countries represented in 
      the JAIC, but could be used <i>"to set an example by teaching the shipbuilding

        II") is now here in Nådendal. There are dozens of persons having for one 
        year or so worked onboard of "Estonia". They know a lot about the vessel's 
        matters. Among others there is also mate Kukk, who shall possibly be heard 
        by us in Tallinn. "Vironia" shall stay at Nådendal for 2 weeks. Is it 
        useful to hear these men by the Commission, e.g. by the end of next week? 
        Will you be sending a representative from your side to here? Part of the 
        men only speak Estonian. We could arrange for a proper tape recording 
        at Nådendal. (Handwritten note on the left side: To be taken up in Tallinn 
        17.10.) <br>
        3. I have asked an expert at PCIMA, a teacher at the Institute of Technology 
        Kotka, Seppo Rajamäki, to help us analyse the radio communication which 
        took place here in Finland. He is teaching radio communication to ship 
        officers. It is the intention that to begin with he will correct the original 
        transcripts of the tape recordings which were typewritten and to attach 
        a time table to the text. <br>
        4. PCIMA's expert in navigation electronic, Asser Koivisto, has met some 
        Russians. They reported that a NAVISAILOR 2000 ECDIS chart system of Russian 
        make had been installed on "Estonia" which registers the covered route, 
        speed and the like. It is possible to take out data from the installation 
        even after it has been in sea water for sometime. In case Sweden should 
        decide for reasons of ship-technical investigations or for other reasons 
        to have the wreck examined by divers, the above-mentioned installation 
        should be brought up, according to Koivisto, the matter should be given 
        a relatively high priority and should be speeded up. The Swedish pilot 
        Benny Pettersson, who frequently piloted "Estonia" knows the exact location 
        of the installation on the bridge. <br>
        5. We hope to make video images of the key areas on the new video films. 
        It is our intention to send a series of colour copies to each country 
        before Tallinn. In addition we are preparing several copies for an eventual 
        press information. I assume that a similar number of journalists will 
        be coming to Tallinn as were at our last meeting in Turku. The really 
        international press will hardly come at all. Yesterday when we published 
        the Mayday tape there was only one journalist present who did not understand 
        Swedish and Finnish. <br>
        6. Finland's police have collected in Hangö Freeport the liferafts from 
        "Estonia" that floated ashore and delivered by various vessels. There 
        shall subsequently be an inspection report on each raft. FBN inspector 
        Jan Jansson, who is also expert to PCIMA, had a look at them. There are 
        also rafts in Estonia (some of them have already been stolen)." </i></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was the day of the 
      3rd meeting of the JAIC, this time in Tallinn. At the meeting the questioning 
      of the key witnesses from the crew was continued respectively started again 
      from the beginning. According to the notes of Tuomo Karppinen the 3rd engineer 
      Margus Treu, the watch A.B. Silver Linde and the trainee mate Einar Kukk 
      were heard. As usual with this commission it was not an organised taking 
      of statements, but the witnesses were questioned in the presence of the 
      whole JAIC and everybody asked what he wanted to ask. <br>
      This time Treu's evidence had changed because he did not mention water on 
      the car deck at 01.00 hours again which he previously said to have reported 
      to the bridge, but now saw Linde at 01.00 hours on the car deck "coming 
      from the pumping station for visor and ramp", although according to his 
      own statement Linde was at 01.00 hours on the bridge and according to Kukk 
      the vessel abruptly heeled to starboard at this time. It is unknown whether 
      this remained unnoted by the audience or whether attempts were made to clarify 
      these differences. The 2nd Interim Report of the JAIC reads as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"At its meeting in 
        Tallinn on 17 October 1994 the Joint Accident Investigation Commission 
        (Sten Andersson did not attend) reviewed new information available to 
        it as a result of additional video films taken from the sunken ship and 
        confirmed the following conclusions of the First Interim Report:" </i><br>
        <b>Note: </b>The visor was still not found "officially". <br>
        <i>"I The bow visor was lost underway."</i> <br>
        <b>Note</b>: The JAIC believed that the visor was lost when the vessel 
        was proceeding at full power against 4.5 m significant wave height which 
        includes 8-9 m seas. This position was maintained all the time and is 
        part of the scenario of the Final Report. <br>
        <i>"II Water entered the car deck at the forward ramp." </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: This is true because it was observed by Treu, Kadak and Sillaste 
        on the monitor and the ramp was found to be open at the wreck. <br>
        <i>"The Commission also assumed the following positions regarding the 
        details and one of the most probable causes of the accident: <br>
        1. The bow door (visor) has separated from the ship as a result of failure 
        of all three locking mechanisms. According to the observations made by 
        members of the crew this happened at about 01.15 when water was simultaneously 
        observed on the TV-monitor, entering the car deck from openings along 
        the vertical sides of the forward ramp. The failures have taken place, 
        in case of the two side locks in the welding of the locking eye plates 
        to the bow visor and in case of the centre lock (as previously shown) 
        by failure of the lugs carrying the locking plunger unit." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Already on the ROV videos from 02. and 09.10.94 the extremely 
        thick welding seams of the side lock lugs are visible, which were created 
        by cutting off/rewelding of the lugs several times as it was observed 
        by many truck drivers - <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">see Subchapter 
        12.5 </a>- however this is not mentioned by the JAIC.<br>
        <i>2. "Following the failure of the locking arrangements the bow visor 
        has opened up under the wave loads. The deck mounted hinge points have 
        eventually failed as a result of the uncontrolled movement of the 55 tons 
        visor, leaving it attached only by the hydraulic actuating cylinders. 
        <br>
        3. During the subsequent unrestrained movement of the bow visor it hit 
        the bow ramp in several modes, including hits from the rear to the upper 
        protrusion of the ramp, causing it to become dislodged from its locking 
        arrangements and to move to a partly open position. The bow visor has 
        ultimately separated from the ship and disappeared overboard." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Apparently at this time JAIC had not yet realised the interlock 
        between visor and bow ramp, i.e. that the upper part of the ramp was extending 
        into the ramp house being part of the visor, which means that if the visor 
        would move forward the ramp would get in contact with the aft part of 
        the ramp house. As long as the visor was empty however and the ramp properly 
        locked and secured, nothing could have happened because the empty visor 
        was unable to break the locks and hooks of the ramp as long as they were 
        intact. Unfortunately neither was the case. See <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a>. <br>
        <i>4. "Partial opening of the ramp had allowed water to enter the car 
        deck due to the heavy sea. Collection of water on the car deck eventually 
        led to loss of stability and capsizing of the vessel." </i><br>
        <b>Note: </b>The JAIC does not yet say that the ramp was fully open but 
        just states "partial opening". Nevertheless, the JAIC seems to believe 
        that the opening was big enough to allow the penetration of a sufficient 
        quantity of water within a very short time 01.15-01.30 hours, i.e. 15 
        minutes from visor off to vessel on the side. <br>
        <i>5. "After the vessel had turned over to almost 90 degrees starboard 
        list, which is estimated to have taken place in less than twenty minutes 
        after the damage to the forward ramp, it started to sink with the stern 
        first. The ship disappeared from the radar screen of a Finnish surveillance 
        station at 01.48. <br>
        6. The vessel turned during the phase of losing stability and landed on 
        the sea bed with an almost easterly heading. It is assumed at this stage 
        this movement was partly the result of an attempt by the officers on the 
        bridge to turn the ship around and partly by the wave action after the 
        ship had lost propulsion power."</i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: They did not yet say whether the vessel turned to port to 
        starboard.<br>
        <i>7. "The locations of the EPIRB-s have not been found during the video 
        documentation and their status is therefore not known at the present time." 
        </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: At that time both EPIRB-s had been found in switched off 
        condition already 15 days before, but this as well as the location of 
        the visor were kept secret. <br>
        <i>8. "Emergency MAYDAY signals were sent by ESTONIA at 01.24 and were 
        received by ships in the area and the MRCC at Turku." </i></font></p>

        UP HOLES </b><br>
        Accident Commission convinced what cause the Estonia shipwreck. Estonia's 
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together 
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull made water flow 
        on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the ship 
        completely changed. <br>
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces 
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, 
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the Accident Commission, who was not present 
        at the Monday session in Tallinn. Also from other very informed sources 
        DN has received the same information, that holes in the hull contributed 
        to water getting into the ship so quickly (...) <br>
        According to Sten Andersson the three visor locks, two on the sides and 
        one at the bottom, was ripped off. This can be seen from the new underwater 
        pictures taken. <br>
        DN's source, with very good insight in the ship's construction, has difficulties 
        to believe that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic lock - could 
        have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. I rather believe that 
        the visor attachments on the deck has broken and that the 54.5 ton visor 
        fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock." "According to the source of 
        DN this scenario gives "violent mechani-cal damages and big holes in the 
        hull". Those holes will then be situated under the water line in the heavy 
        sea." </i></font></p>

      the sinking. Nothing thereof however was mentioned to the public by JAIC.

        ESTONIA Accident <br>
        Further to our exchange of information yesterday, you have probably noticed 
        that the bow door has now been found and identified. It is located on 
        the seabed about 1 nautical mile west of the wreck itself. This seems 
        to indicate that the captain has attempted to turn the ship around at 
        an early stage of the development of the accident, however without success 
        in the end result. <b>This will slightly change our picture of the sequence

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Börje Stenström finalised 
      the Status Report on 28 October and it is interesting to note how he changed, 
      for example item 12 referring to the stabilizer fins: <br>
      <b>Draft Version 24.10.94:</b></font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"12. The stabilizer 
        fins were according to witness observation in extended position during

        fins were according to witness observation in extended position during 
        the sinking. The port side one seems to be in retracted position in the

        gravity after failure of the hydraulic system."</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The draft version states 
      that "both fins seem to be in retracted position" while the final version 
      states that only "the port side one seems to be in retracted position". 
      This implies that Stenström knew that the starboard fin was not in retracted 
      position, but apparently also not in extended position which should be the 
      case created by gravity if the fin would have been intact. Since the starboard 
      fin was apparently neither retracted nor extended, it has to be assumed 
      that it was missing. <br>

      the Swedish JAIC spoke to:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - the previous masters 
      of the 'NORD ESTONIA' Per Ringhagen and Sten Levander, and further with 
      the Stockholm pilots having piloted the ESTONIA frequently,<br>
      - the employees of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm Shipinspec office,<br>
      - the management of N&T and Estline. From 9 to 18 November the visor was 
      searched and finally lifted by the Finnish multipurpose ice breaker 'NORDICA' 
      assisted by the Swedish mine hunter 'FURUSUND'. <a href="chapter26.htm" target="_blank">See 
      Chapter 26. </a>During the lifting operation Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka 
      from the Finnish JAIC were present on board of the 'NORDICA'. <br>
      The visor was landed ashore in Hangö and put on blocks in upside down condition 
      at the premises of Messrs. Levator Oy where it stayed in the open air until 
      it was shipped to Sweden by the Swedish Navy in December 1999. The visor 
      was closely examined by members and experts of the JAIC from all three countries 
      and it was subsequently decided to have the bulkhead parts in way of the 
      torn off lugs of the hydraulic side locks cut out and transported to the 
      Royal Technical High School (KTH), Stockholm. This was carried out after 
      the 23 November because when representatives of Meyer Werft inspected the 
      visor for the first time on that day these parts were still in position 
      and are thus visible on the photos then made. <br>
      Andi Meister writes in his book "<i>The Unfinished Logbook"</i> about the 
      visor inspection as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"On 2 December the 
        inspection of the visor in Hangö took place. In addition to the other 
        acknowledged experts also the scientists of the Estonian Shipping Company 
        (ESCO) and of the Technical University of Tallinn, August Ingerma and 
        Jaan Metsaveer, participated. It was now also established by means of 
        squeezed steel parts that the visor had pulled open the ramp and that 
        the ramp had been completely open until becoming partly closed again when 
        the vessel turned upside down.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Swedish Government 
      had instructed Sjöfartsverket already on 3 October to develop possibilities 
      to recover the bodies out of the wreck and it was thus decided to have the 
      wreck examined by divers. A description of the work required was drawn up 
      in the form of tender conditions which were sent to 14 contractors - see 
      also Chapter 27 - and the job was finally awarded to Smit-Tak/Rockwater, 
      i.e. Smit, Rotterdam, the world's leading salvage company. The contract 
      was signed on 29 November and the work began on 1 December, however, was 
      delayed due to the wrong wreck position stated in the tender conditions 
      - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27.</a> <br>
      Also the JAIC was given the opportunity of having parts of the wreck examined 
      and taken up. In order to make the necessary decisions Börje Stenström (and 
      most probably Tuomo Karppinen) attended on board the diving support vessel 
      'SEMI I' while the Estonian side was represented by Aarne Valgma, the head 
      of the Sea Safety Division of the E.N.M.B. and the man who could have prevented 
      the last sailing of the ESTONIA (and consequently her sinking). <br>
      As the JAIC had made up their mind already what had caused the sinking of 
      the ferry, their interest remained restricted to the bow area and to some 
      limited extent to the bridge where allegedly three bodies had been found 
      (although there were at least 5), which were allegedly not identified although 
      some of them were wearing uniforms. The cabins of master, chief engineer, 
      radio officer and the owners' cabin all located directly below the bridge 
      were allegedly not examined. At least nothing is mentioned in the official 
      reports. There was however another "unofficial" diving investigation going 
      on at the same time - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
      27</a>, <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 34.6 </a>and the Disengage 
      Report in <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      34.6.434.</a> - the result of which regrettably has never been made public. 
      It is certain however that the work of this "unofficial" diving team was 
      executed with the consent - if not on instruction - of a certain Swedish 
      government authority. A number of objects from the wreck were recovered 
      by divers and brought to the surface, among others the lugs of the Atlantic 
      locks burnt off in a rather unprofessional way, i.e. each lug was burnt 
      off instead of burning off the whole deck part to which the lugs were welded. 
      Due to this way of burning, the bottom parts of the lugs - say the lower 
      20-30% were missing - which made the lugs look rather small. Also the sensor 
      plate fitted next to the lugs was burnt off but thrown to the sea bottom 
      by the diver and thus disappeared forever. <br>
      <b>Note</b>: The examination of this sensor plate ashore would doubtless 
      have proven that the holes for the screws having previously held the sensors 
      were corroded to such an extent that it would have been obvious that the 
      sensors had been removed already several months before the casualty, a violation 
      of the class requirements which would have forced B.V. to withdraw the class 
      of the ferry in hindsight with substantial consequences for the owners. 
      <br>
      In addition to the sensor plate also the sensor cables were clipped off 
      and thrown to the sea bottom by the diver obviously for the same reason, 
      because on the video footage it is clearly visible that these cables were 
      cut and not broken by being torn off, of which N&T tried to persuade B.V. 
      and the JAIC in endless argumentation and writings. Obviously with success 
      because B.V. did not withdraw the class nor did B.V. ever criticise N&T/ESCO 
      and the JAIC just noted on page 128, Subchapter 8.6.6 of their Final Report: 
      </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"The magnetic-type 
        position sensors for the bottom lock were not in position on their mounting 
        bracket according to pictures taken during the ROV and diving investigations. 
        The electric cabling that had been part of the sensor installation and 
        the ends of the cables were visible in the area. The mounting bracket 
        for the sensors appeared to be intact or possibly bent slightly aft. No 
        other signs of any mechanical action could be seen on the bracket. The 
        12-millimetre-diameter bolt holes for the originally installed mechanical 
        switches were empty. It is not fully clear how the magnetic sensors had 
        been installed on the bracket. The magnet which was part of the bottom 
        lock position indicator was after the accident visible on its mounting 
        bracket in the locking bolt. According to information obtained from the 
        electrical engineer who installed the magnetic sensors and the magnet 
        in the mid-1980s they were of the Siemens 3SE6-type." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> According to a member of the 2nd crew the sensors had been 
        dismounted and the cables were cut at the end of the ice winter in April 
        1994. The sensors were not reinstalled as the crew members had to go down 
        anyway and open respectively close the bolt of the Atlantic lock by hammering, 
        as this was no more possible hydraulically due to the severe misalignment 
        and distortions of the lugs. Therefore a remote control was no more required.

    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Atlantic lock bolt, 
      however, a most important piece of evidence in the JAIC's chain of argumentation, 
      was brought to the surface but, much to the surprise of the outside world, 
      thrown back into the sea by Stenström, allegedly after having measured its 
      thickness and found it to be undamaged and straight, a statement, which 
      is apparently false, as must be concluded from the rather good video footage 
      available - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2.</a><br>
      It has to be assumed that Stenström very well realised from the explanations 
      and pictures of the diver that the lugs of the hydraulic side locks could 
      do substantial damage to the JAIC scenario when brought up to the surface 
      and subsequently being examined ashore. The extremely thick welding seams 
      would have proven that they consisted of several welds on top of each other, 
      i.e. frequent cutting off/rewelding had taken place. Furthermore it would 
      have become known that the missing bulkhead parts to cover the holes in 
      both aft bulkheads of the visor (where the lugs had been sitting) were not 
      attached to the lugs (apart from a tiny piece). This meant that the lugs 
      had no more been welded to the bulkheads as original but had just been stuck 
      through pre-cut holes and then welded on to the remnants of previous welding 
      seams. Al this was naturally combined with a substantial reduction of the 
      initial load carrying capacity of the locks. Stenström decided to leave 
      the locks in the wreck. <br>
      The recovery of the visor hinge bolts which had already been ordered to 
      the divers was stopped also. A close examination of these bolts would have 
      brought results - see Subchapter<a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank"> 29.2 
      </a>- for the JAIC casualty scenario. <br>
      By fax of 06.12.1994 to Andi Meister, Stenström briefly reports on the diving 
      inspection (see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 27</a>) 
      and concludes:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Findings in the 
        bow area generally <b>confirmed the earlier hypothesis of the development 
        of the accident.</b> Broken lugs of the bottom lock of the visor were 
        recovered for detailed examination. One hinge for the visor was also recovered. 
        Damages on the bow area and the ramp were documented. <br>
        <b>The findings support the hypothesis that the visor broke loose from

        to move</b>. The visor thereby forced the ramp open due to mechanical 
        interference. <b>The visor probably brought the ramp to fully open position

        hull mounted part intact, hinge separated.<br>
        Number 2. Both lugs on ramp lower beam broken, hinge separated. <br>
        Number 3. No damage, some play at pin. <br>
        Number 4, starboard side. No damage, same play at pin." </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not state that the port outer hinge was found 
        to be bent and misaligned, with the bolt moved to starboard, both securing 
        plates missing and the port "outer eye" (lug) slipped off the bolt. He 
        also failed to mention the mattresses, bed-clothing, blankets and rags 
        squeezed between ramp and bulkhead at the port outer ramp hinge, although 
        this had become public knowledge (see DN of 07.10., page 59 above). <br>
        <i>"2. Ramp front side.<br>
        Heavy damage at lower end, most at starboard side. <br>
        Ramp beams damaged at lower ends and in centre line at mid length (possible 
        contact with fore peak deck locating horn)."</i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention that the ramp is bent longitudinally, 
        is resting on the starboard bulkhead with a gap existing between the port 
        bulkhead and the ramp, i.e. that the ramp has been exposed to pressure 
        from port to starboard, which had led to very severe deformations of all 
        the transverse beams, except for the lower ones and to deformation of 
        the longitudinal beams in the lower area which he interpreted to have 
        been caused by contact with the forepeak deck. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2.</a><br>
        <i>"3. Ramp inner side.<br>
        Some damage at top." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> He means apparently the damage to the port outer beam which 
        was bent and distorted at the upper side, but the severe damage to the 
        inner ramp plating in the upper third with burnt and distorted plates 
        and also the distorted flaps in way of the centre line at the top and 
        the bottom of the ramp are not mentioned. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2. 
        </a><br>
        <i>"4. Ramp actuating cylinders. <br>
        Port side one found extended, rod end failed." </i><br>
        <b>Note:</b> The videos clearly show that the port ramp actuator was sitting 
        in <b>retracted</b> condition inside the bulkhead opening with the piston 
        rod broken at the lug fitted to the lugs at the ramp side. These lugs 
        at the ramp side were missing. The videos also show that the starboard 
        ramp actuator was also broken, once at the lug, same as the port one, 
        but again at the piston rod because this part was found by the diver to 
        be jammed in between ramp and bulkhead recess. The remains of the piston 
        rod and the actuator were noted inside the bulkhead in retracted condition. 
        The lugs at the ramp side are missing, the fastening of these lugs was 
        found to be blown open and distorted. See Subchapter <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a> 
        and <a href="chapter32.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 32</a>.<br>

        lower one partly extended, no visible damage to mating box." </i><br>
        <b>Note</b>: Stenström does not mention the diver's report that there 
        was a misalignment of 21/2 inches = 10 cm at port side between the plungers 
        (bolts) and the mating boxes which also existed between the ramp hook 
        and the mating lug. He also did not mention that both port mating boxes 
        as well as the mating lug and the ramp hook were found to be intact which 
        means that the entire port side of the bow ramp had not been secured at 
        all upon departure from Tallinn (and numerous voyages before already).

        reported that no bulk-head parts were attached to the lugs at all. "<br>

        the crane of 'SEMI I'. At this time the cracks in the welds of the visor 
        hinges had already been known to the Estonians for 2 months, however, 
        the Finns and Swedish JAIC members were not informed.<br>

        noted by Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée - see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter

        <b>Note: </b>The examination of the bridge - under the aspect of acci-dent 
        investigation - was totally unacceptable, for example Stenström failed 
        to have the divers establish: <br>
        (a) course on the gyros which would have indicated the heading of the 
        vessel at the time the auxiliary engines stopped; <br>

        (d) the identity of the bodies by means of their ranks indicated on their 
        uniforms and the type of clothes of plain clothed bodies. <br>
        (e) whether any documents were still possibly legible (Stenström most 
        likely knew that the logbook had been recovered already in the early days 
        of October 1994 by Swedish Navy divers). <br>
        <i>"The controls for the watertight doors were found to be push button

      the JAIC was dominated by technicians, in particular by naval architects 
      like Börje Stenström. Thus also the investigation was performed from the 
      technical points of view of shipbuilders. It is unknown whether the master 
      mariners Hans Rosengren and Olle Noord were always happy with the rapid 
      development of the cause consideration and casualty scenario in which the 
      surrounding circumstances, in particular the nautical ones, were often grossly 
      neglected. <br>
      On 6 December 1994 Börje Stenström, accompanied by his assistant Mikael 
      Huss, also naval architect and lecturer at the KTH, Stockholm, visited Meyer 
      Werft in Papenburg for the second time. They had brought the starboard and 
      centre lugs of the Atlantic lock with them for demonstration purposes. According 
      to the notes of Dr. Holtappels Stenström explained the following: </font></p>
    <blockquote>

        Summary of Technical Findings and Technical Evaluation of the Probable 
        Sequence of Events and Cause of the Accident.<br>
        </i></b><i>The investigation of technical facts related to the accident 
        has continued with high priority. <b>The findings and conclusions reported 
        and agreed on during the meeting on 17th October in Tallinn are essentially 
        still valid</b> but various additional findings have been made and the 
        related probable development of the accident has been further clarified 
        and modified. .... <br>
        The summary below describes the technical findings and also the effect 
        these may have had on the development of the accident. <br>
        1. All evidence found so far confirm the hypothesis that the mechanical 
        failure started with failure of the lower locks of the visor. Most probably 
        the bottom lock failed first. The mounting lugs for this lock have been 
        recovered from the wreck. <b>They indicate that the failure in the lugs 
        has been caused by overload and also that the actual welding of the locking 
        plunger housing to the lugs has been less extensive than presumed in the 
        engineering calculations. The total load carrying capacity of the mounting 
        of the bottom lock has therefore been less than intended. </b>The internal 
        work routines of the shipyard relevant for this condition are being discussed 
        with the yard."</i><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Note:</b> <b>1. Failure 
        in the lugs has been caused by overload: </b><br>
        The subsequent investigation by Prof. Hoffmeister - see <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        34.8</a> - Enclosure 34.8.436 - proved that the welding seams between 
        "locking plunger housing" and lugs were up to 90% penetrated by fatigue 
        cracks. <br>
        <b>2. Welding of the "locking plunger housing" to the lugs has been less 
        extensive than presumed in the engineering calculations:</b><br>
        The welding seams found were about 3 mm thick while according to the Meyer 
        yard welders having done the job, they were 7-8 mm thick originally which 
        was also in conformity with the yard's standard welding rules when welding 
        a 15 mm thick component to a structure. In such case each weld had to 
        correspond to 50% of the thickness of the component to be welded. Thus 
        it has to assumed that the welds and probably also the lugs were not original 
        and definitely the rather poor repair welds of the starboard lug did not 
        originate from the yard. - See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        12.5</a>. - The JAIC was not interested and arranged for a paint analysis 
        of the starboard lug only in December 1996. <br>
        3. The total load carrying capacity (lcc) of the bottom lock has therefore 
        been less than intended.<br>
        According to Stenström's own calculation the lcc of the Atlantic lock 
        had been only 70-80 ts. while actually a subsequent break test with 3 
        m welds revealed a break load of 220 ts. See <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
        34.3</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.3.431.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
        34.3.431</a>. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"2. The side locks 
          at the same moment or immediately after the bottom lock. Inadequate 
          rigidity in the mounting of the lugs of the side locks have reduced 
          the ability of these lugs to pick up load at the same rate as the bottom 
          lock, indirectly contributing to overload of the bottom lock."</i><br>
          <b>Note:</b> The findings of the divers were apparently ignored - see 
          page 81. The "inadequate rigidity in the mounting of the lugs", actually 
          was always existent. It was caused by the frequent rewelding on top 
          of existing welding seams around the 2 lugs which were just stuck through 
          existing openings in the aft bulkheads of the visor.<br>
          <i>"3. The hinges at the visor pivoting points on upper deck have <b>also 
          failed due to overload.</b>" </i><br>
          <b>Note</b>: By this time the disastrous condition of the starboard 
          hinge having been almost penetrated by fatigue cracks initiated by deep 
          burning marks was known to Stenström and his colleagues by their visual 
          inspection of the broken hinges at the visor in Hangö and by examining 
          the recovered bushing with the part of the broken visor arm still attached. 
          According to Prof. Hoffmeister the lcc of the starboard hinge was reduced 
          to a mere 20% of its original and this did not yet take into account 
          the consequences of the subsequent findings demonstrated with the passenger 
          video received in April 1996 - see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
          12.5</a> - and Enclosures <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">12.5.180</a>/<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.htm" target="_blank">12.5.181.</a><br>
          <i>"8. When the visor left the ship it left behind it the ramp in fully 
          open position, initially allowing large amounts of water to enter the 
          car deck within a short period of time. This is believed to explain 
          the reported rapid initial generation of starboard list."</i><br>
          <b>Note</b>: If the ramp would have been fully open it would have broken 
          off. See <a href="34.9.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 34.10.</a> This 
          is in particular valid if the vessel would have continued to proceed 
          with 14-15 kn against the waves as alleged by the JAIC at all times 
          including in their Final Report, see <a href="chapter13.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
          13.2</a>, page 171, ff. <br>
          <i>"10. In total it is considered to be verified that inadequate structural 
          strength in the visor locking mechanisms has been the under-laying condition 
          for development of the accident. The sea loads on the visor generated 
          by an irregular wave condition with occasional high waves in combination 
          with the speed of the vessel is considered to have been the ultimate 
          factor, triggering the structural failure in the particular instant." 
          </i><br>
          <b>Note:</b> Not a single of these hypothetical assumptions corresponds 
          with proven facts and/or the law of physics known to the members of 
          the JAIC. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">After the meeting a press 
        conference was held and the Press Release - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/37.2.460.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
        37.2.460</a> - was distributed. It reads in part:</font></p>

        <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"2. The Commission

          detailed substantiation<b> before conclusions should be drawn and made 
          public. </b><br>
          3. The Commission confirmed, however,<b> its opinion </b>that the<b> 
          strength of the locking devices for the bow visor</b> in combination 
          with the sea loads on the visor in the prevailing wave condition and 
          headway of the ship <b>is the main cause of the accident</b>." </i><br>
          <b>Note:</b> It is apparent that the application of logic was also not 
          one of the habits of the JAIC because 3 contradicts 2. It is stated 
          in other words, that the locking devices of the visor were too weak 
          to withstand forces normally encountered during heavy weather. That 
          the vessel had traded in the area with similar weather conditions for 
          no less than 14.5 years was simply disregarded by the JAIC. Why apply 
          common sense? </font></p>

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">No one took notice that 
        in item 5 the JAIC stated that <i>"the diving investigation carried out 
        on the wreck has revealed that the ramp was locked in closed position 
        prior to the accident"</i>. At this time the JAIC positively knew from 
        the videos that the complete port side of the ramp cannot have been locked 
        prior to the accident. See <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">Chapter
