    was operated in a ferry service between Stockholm and Tallinn.</font></font></p>

    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel 
    berthed at Terminal 2 in Basin No. 2 (see map attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.1.138.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.1.138</a>), starboard side to shore, loading/discharging via bow ramp, 
    i.e. the vessel was alongside all day with open visor. Berthing was not always 
    easy which is demonstrated by the frequent use of the port anchor. The vessel 
    had to pass the narrow entrance between the two breakwaters with some speed, 
    in particular when side winds were prevailing, but the stopping distance ahead 
    was only about 3 ship lengths. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The scheduled 
    arrival was 09.00 hours and the departure was 19.00 hours (Estonian time = 
    Swedish time + 1 hour). At wind speeds in excess of 15 m/sec the ferry proceeded 
    stern first all the way out through the breakwater and turned round outside, 
    at lower wind speeds the turning took place already inside the breakwater.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
    route from Tallinn to Stockholm was leading between mainland and the island 
    Nayssaar to the west and followed the Estonian coast with a course of ca. 
    262° to a waypoint on approximately 59°20' N, 22°00' E. The waypoint was changed 
    according to requirements. Up to the waypoint the vessel was normally running 
    on full speed, i.e. in calm sea = about 19 kn, and depending on the time when 
    the waypoint was reached, the speed was then adjusted to be at the Sandhamn 
    pilot at ca. 05.00 hours respectively at the Söderarm pilot at about 04.00 
    hours. The course from the waypoint to Sandhamn was ca. 266° and to the Söderarm 
    entrance 287°. </font> </p>
