  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) the weather situation 
    explained below developed during the course of 27 September 1994:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The weather 
    conditions on the 27th September were dominated by a "strong and extensive 
    area of low pressure with several lows" which covered northern Scandinavia 
    and the Arctic Sea. See the weather chart for Europe in Enclosure 1 from 12.00 
    hours UTC on the 27th September. <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One 
    of these lows deepened on the 27th and moved rapidly east via southern Norway 
    and eastern Svealand towards southern Finland. The low remained relatively 
    strong and the centre was near Oslo on the 27th at 12.00 hours UTC with a 
    low pressure of 995 HPA, on the 28th at 00.00 hours UTC it was over the south-eastern 
    part of the Gulf of Bothnia with a low pressure of 980 HPA. On the evening 
    of the 27th a warm front connected to this low with occasional rain showers 
    passed quickly eastward over the northern Baltic. South and south-west of 
    this low pressure a wind change from SW to west occurred and the westerly 
    wind was very squally.«</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The SMHI has investigated 
    the weather conditions before, during and after the casualty on behalf of 
    JAIC. The results are summarised in a weather opinion with the title <i><b>"The

    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having passed 
    the breakwater (see Chapter 19) ESTONIA proceeded between the mainland and 
    the Island Nayssaar and - after having passed the buoy off Suurupi Lighthouse 
    - altered course to 262° on the gyro-compass. This was confirmed by passenger 
    Anders Ericson, who had been on the bridge between 20.00 - 20.30 hours ET 
    - see his statement Enclosure 20.239 - and saw the course digitally shown 
    to be 262°, which is actually the true course to the waypoint on 59°20' N; 
    022°00' E. He also realised that the wind speed was then already 20 m/sec. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent 
    fact that ESTONIA had taken her normal route was further confirmed by the 
    observations of the meeting vessel AMBER. The M.V. AMBER is a Polish Ro-Ro 
    vessel, then on voyage from Gdynia to Helsinki when she met ESTONIA. The watch 
    officer of AMBER has only recently been traced and questioned. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    his testimony AMBER passed ESTONIA at 22.15/20 hours CET = 23.15/20 hours 
    Estonian time. ESTONIA was on a course of about 260/265°, at a position about 
    18 nm before the waypoint on 59°20'N; 022°00'E. She was running apparently 
    on full speed against heavy head seas which the watch mate on board of AMBER 
    described as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The ferry was 
      brightly illuminated and appeared to proceed against wind and sea at full 
      speed, which I could hardly believe. According to data from the ARPA her 
      speed was about 18-19 kn. She was pitching heavily and I saw how she was 
      taking a lot of water on the forecastle deck which smashed against the superstructure 
      and was thrown up to the bridge windows and spray was all over the vessel. 
      When her bow smashed into the waves I had the impression that she almost 
      stopped and subsequently built up speed again when the foreship rose. In 
      my opinion those in charge on the bridge of the ESTONIA must have been crazy, 
      absolutely incompetent and inexperienced. I had never seen anything like 
      this before.« <br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete 
      statement is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.237.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      20.237.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The evidence of 
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk, having been on the bridge until about 00.35 hours, 
    also confirms that ESTONIA at first proceeded to her normal waypoint. In summary 
    of the aforementioned it has to be concluded now that the ESTONIA took the 
    southerly route, i.e. her normal route, to the waypoint on 59°20'N, 022°00'E 
    and that she had apparently no problems until about 23.30 hours, when she 
    was last seen by the watch officer of AMBER. Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned 
    that in the files of the public </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    it has to be mentioned that in the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand 
    the copy of a navy chart was found which indicates that ESTONIA took a course 
    of about 270° true from the end of the Traffic-Separation-Scheme (TSS) between 
    the mainland and the Island Nayssaar straight up to Söderarm. This could have 
    been realistic since it was known from the beginning that she had to enter 
    the archipelago Söderarm because of the pilot examination of Captain Avo Piht. 
    Therefore it would actually not have been necessary first to go down to the 
    waypoint and then go up to the North again. On the other hand, it could also 
    be argued that sailing as long as possible in the shelter of the Estonian 
    North coast would be for the comfort of the passengers, although evidently 
    this was the last thing Arvo Andresson cared about. The navy chart is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.240. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the Finnish Navy, however, ESTONIA took with circa 90% probability a completely 
    different route. Allegedly after having crossed the TSS north of Nayssaar 
    she did follow the westbound lane along the Finnish coast, but subsequently 
    altered course to the south-west. In the opinion of this 'Group of Experts' 
    this is the less likely version because it is the longest distance and simply 
    impossible for ESTONIA to pass within the time available. The radar track 
    of this possible route of ESTONIA along the Finnish coast is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.240.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.241</a> together with the memo about the information received from the 
    head office of the Finnish Navy in December 1998. For more details see Subchapter 
    22.3.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the evidence 
    of the survivor Anders Ericson as well as that of the watch officer of AMBER 
    appears to be reliable and do confirm the normal route along the Estonian 
    North coast to the waypoint, it has to be concluded that this was the route 
    the ESTONIA took on her last voyage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The next image is 
    part of Sea Chart BA 2241 on which all the relevant positions and course lines 
    are shown. At 21.00 hours the watch on the bridge was taken over by 2nd officer 
    Peeter Kannussaar and 3rd officer Andres Tammes. Trainee officer Einar Kukk 
    was also on the bridge since about 20.30 hours.</font></p>

    the vessel was at full speed. The lower side of the bow ramp was below 3rd

    Silver Linde came on watch and went safety rounds every hour, which commenced 
    30 minutes after the full hour and ended just before or on the full hour. 
    These rounds included 0-deck (sauna/swimming pool compart-ment), 1st-deck 
    in way of passenger accommodation and car deck, where he spent some 15 minutes. 
    He had to activate control clocks at various check points. For more details

    hours after having made a distance of 48 nm at full speed - ca. 20.0 kn - 
    the vessel left the shelter of mainland/islands and due to increasing sea/swell 
    from SW-ly directions the speed went down, although the 4 main engines continued 
    on full power. At about that time ESTONIA was overtaking MARIELLA off Hangö.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> Trainee 
    officer Einar Kukk has meanwhile left ESCO and is thus free to talk. He has 
    recently told Joel Haukka that the officers on watch were frightened about 
    the much too high speed, but did not dare to reduce the pitch without instructions 
    from the master.</font></p>

    and his colleagues went up to the deck where the lifeboats and the liferafts

    vessel and therefore were looking down on the bow several decks below them 
    where the waves were smashing against the bow. The waves were smashing so 
    strongly against the bow that the spray water came up to them and they had 
    to protect themselves by seeking shelter behind the steel-sheet covered railing. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bow area

    22.30 hours ship's time.<br>

    quite strongly, it was raining and the waves were high. The whole evening 
    Hillerström had heard heavy banging throughout the vessel's hull, which was 
    sometimes felt. Hillerström got the feeling that the vessel was slamming against 
    the waves. He compared it with a motorboat speeding over choppy waves. He 
    did not feel well and at about 23.30 hours ship's time he went to the aft 
    part of the 6th deck, there he found some shelter at starboard behind the 
    wall of the restaurant and the face plate. Although he stood at lee side,

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(1)</b> 19.30 
      Outside breakwater on full speed to the western exit of the Traffic Separation 
      Scheme NW of Suurupi Lighthouse, which ESTONIA passed at about <br>
      <b>(2)</b> 20.25 i.e. 18.5 nm in 55 minutes, i.e. 20 kn.<br>
      <b>(3) </b>According to the JAIC, ESTONIA passed Osmussaar Lighthouse at 
      a distance of ca. 7.5 nm. The average speed was 20 kn between (2) and (3). 
      <br>
      <b>(4) </b>Further according to the JAIC the vessel passed the Apollo buoy 
      at about 22.55 hours, i.e. the distance of 16.5 nm between (3) and (4) was 
      covered in 55 minutes which corresponds to 18 kn. Note: Assuming that ESTONIA 
      passed the Tallinn breakwater already on full speed at 19.30 hours, which 
      the JAIC does but which is certainly too early, but anyway let's assume 
      it, she covered the 73 nm to the passing of AMBER in 3 hours 45 minutes, 
      which corresponds to an average speed of 19.5 kn. <br>
      <b>(5)</b> Further according to the JAIC the ESTONIA passed the Glotov buoy 
      at about 23.55 hours, i.e. from 23.15 hours. These are 40 minutes in which 
      she passed 10.8 nm, this corresponds to an average speed of 16.2 kn, a speed 
      reduction due to the increasing forward sea, in spite of all 4 main engines 
      running on full power.</font></p>

      that at about 23.00 hours, shortly before the next course alteration towards 
      West, several large single breakers struck the vessel in way of the port 
      bow edge. Captain Andresson came on the bridge about 30 minutes later, stayed 
      there for about 15 minutes and left the bridge at about 15 minutes before 
      the next course alteration. I do remember that the master asked the 3rd 
      mate whether all 4 engines were running and he received, in my opinion, 
      an affirmative reply. In any case, I have heard the order of the master 
      to activate the fins for the stabilisation of the vessel after the next 
      course alteration. According to my recollection at that time our vessel

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - According to SMHI 
    the wind and sea conditions were then as follows: <br>

    1994<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 00.00 
    hours there was a watch change in the engine room and from then on 3rd engineer 
    Margus Treu and motorman Hannes Kadak were in charge. At ca. 00.25/00.30 hours 
    the vessel reached the waypoint on about 59°20'N; 21°59'E, the course was 
    changed to 287° true towards Söderarm and the stabilisers were activated a 
    little later at ca. 00.30 hours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Einar Kukk continues:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>- »I do remember 
      that the speed of our vessel decreased after the course alteration, I also 
      remember that the 2nd mate told this to me.<b> At that time it was about 
      00.00 hours and still heavy sea state.</b><br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- 
      At about 00.30 hours Silver returned from his control round </b>and reported 
      that on board everything was in order, only passengers would be seasick. 
      5-10 minutes after Silver had returned to the bridge, I left and went straight 
      to my cabin.« </font></i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about this time 
    - 00.00-01.00 hours - the wind and sea conditions according to SMHI were:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Wind: SW 16-20 
      m/s, squalls of up to 23 m/s.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Waves: 3.5-4.5 
      m, max. 7.0 m.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In case the course 
    alteration to starboard of 25° had been carried out, the wind and sea then 
    should have come more from the port beam. Thus the speed should actually have 
    increased since the full engine output remained unchanged, however, since 
    the stabilisers had been activated after the waypoint, which reduced the speed 
    by ca. 1 kn, it has to be assumed that the speed increase was balanced by 
    the speed decrease and thus the speed over ground probably remained at about 
    15-16 kn, which is rather high under the circumstances prevailing.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    Einar Kukk, Silver Linde returned to the bridge at ca. 00.30 hours, while 
    actually he should have returned already at about 00.00 hours and started 
    his next round at 00.30 hours. According to the statements of Silver Linde, 
    available to this 'Group of Experts' (in total 8), he allegedly returned to 
    the bridge at about 00.00 hours and started his next (and last) round at 00.30 
    hours. Based on the apparent fact that Silver Linde has given more different 
    statements than anybody else, this 'Group of Experts' is inclined to believe 
    that Einar Kukk, who was new on board and not a crew member, is much less 
    influenced by the surrounding circumstances than Silver Linde was and still 
    is. In case Silver Linde should have returned to the bridge only at about 
    00.30 hours he must have left for his next round shortly afterwards and went 
    again down to the car deck. Since it could not have been the water on the 
    car deck which kept him down there, because this was noted already before 
    22.00 hours when the starboard stern ramp was slightly opened - See Subchapter 
    29.7 - while he had taken over the watch only at 22.00 hours. It has rather 
    to be assumed that the crew activities on the car deck, to hold the visor 
    and the bow ramp, were the reason for his delay.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    ESTONIA continued with unchanged full output to force her way against the 
    still increasing seas while most of her passengers had already gone to bed, 
    be it that they were seasick or that they were just tired of always having 
    to hold on to something due to the hard movements of the ferry. Only very 
    few could sleep, most were lying awake listening to the noises created by 
    the vessel when slamming into the waves and feeling the vibrations caused 
    by the 4 main engines running on full power.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As already 
    outlined in the previous chapter, quite a number of passengers were most irritated 
    by the way the vessel was powering against the waves and many truck drivers 
    were thinking of their trucks down on the car deck, especially those knowing 
    that their trucks were not secured. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular 
    the passengers in the cabins on 1st-deck, i.e. the deck below the car deck, 
    were alerted from the beginning because they were not only below the car deck, 
    but also below the waterline and not far away from the bow area with the partly 
    loose visor moving up and down within the play created by the indented stempost, 
    the missing rubber packings and the worn out lugs of the locking devices.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this respect 
    reference is made to the statement of Mikael Öun - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.225.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.2.225</a> - who testified to the Swedish police on 04.10.94, when among 
    other things the following was protocolled:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»While he was 
      sitting in the sauna he continuously heard banging noises which he attributed 
      to the waves smashing against vessel's bow. When he came back to his cabin 
      he still heard the banging noises and continued to hear them, he even woke 
      up from them after having fallen into a light sleep.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also passenger Ulla 
    Marianne Tenman in cabin 1098, i.e. below the car deck and located at starboard 
    side in way of the 2nd compartment from forward, was deeply concerned already 
    quite some time before the casualty sequence-of-events commenced. She has 
    testified to the Swedish police on 04.10.94 when among other things the following 
    was protocolled:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Some time 
      before the casualty Ulla was down in her cabin. She stated to have heard 
      several hard bangs and something that was beating against something. This 
      appeared very strange to her. She spoke to her colleagues, decided to go 
      up to the 8th deck and wait what would happen.«<br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Her statement 
      is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.1.288.htm" target="_blank"> 
      Enclosure 21.3.1.288.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These banging noises - in 
    all probability created by the visor moving within the available play - had 
    already been heard by many passengers on previous voyages, among those was 
    passenger Ivan Petrov who had stayed in cabin 1064 on 22.09.94 and reference 
    is made in this respect to Subchapter 12.4.5 - Other Observations.<br>
    The ESTONIA continued all the time on full power against the increasing seas 
    until at about 00.50 hours - after it had been noted or reported that something 
    was wrong with visor and/or bow ramp - the speed was reduced to probably 6 
    kn until at 01.02 hours the vessel heeled wide to starboard and turned to 
    port. At this moment the farthest point to the West must have been reached, 
    because shortly afterwards at approximately 01.10/12 hours, the main engines 
    stopped and the vessel drifted East or NE and lost the visor about 30 minutes 
    later. It has thus to be assumed that the farthest point to the West has been 
    about 0.5 nm to the West of the alleged visor position, where ESTONIA must 
    have been at about 00.50 hours.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> After ca. 00.50 hours ESTONIA was first turned to starboard and 
    subsequently to port and was presumably kept on SW course against wind and 
    sea for some time until the sharp port turn commenced, which explains the 
    more southerly Mayday position. The distance from the 23.15 hours-position 
    to the ca. 01.00 hours-position is 30.0 nm which the vessel passed in 1 hour 
    45 min., of which the last ca. 10 minutes were on reduced speed. This corresponds 
    to an average speed of ca. 17 kn. <br>
    As the time of the casualty sequence-of-events commenced at about 00.30 hours 
    and ended at about 01.50 hours with the sinking of the ESTONIA the many statements 
    of the survivors now have to be analysed in the following Chapter 21. </font></p>
