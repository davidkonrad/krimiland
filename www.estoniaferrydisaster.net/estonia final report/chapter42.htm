  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">CHAPTER 42</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> FINDINGS</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">This Chapter is purposely 
    written in the same order as the corresponding Chapter 20 in the Report of 
    the JAIC in order to facilitate an easy comparison for the reader. Where no 
    corresponding remarks are found, this 'Group of Experts' either agrees or 
    has not investigated the specific subject. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Accident </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">- The car/passenger ferry 
    ESTONIA sank during the early hours of 28 September 1994 in the Northern Baltic 
    on its voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm. According to the official figures 
    only 137 passengers and crew members survived. The wreck lies in international 
    waters. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Weather / Sea state </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - At the time of the casualty 
    the wind was blowing from SW-ly directions with a speed of 18-20 m/sec. The 
    significant wave height was about 4 metres. Neither wind speed nor sea state 
    were exceptional for the season. <br>
    - Before the sequence-of-events of the casualty commenced the ESTONIA was 
    pitching extremely hard in bow seas from port forward due to a speed which 
    must be considered excessive under the prevailing conditions.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Ship's Condition</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - When the ferry left Tallinn 
    she was unseaworthy for the following reasons: Her bow was open to the sea. 
    The bow visor and the bow ramp, which should both be water(weather)tight, 
    were leaking with the consequence that seawater had uncontrolled access to 
    the car deck, a condition which must be avoided by all means, as it severely 
    endangers the safety of the vessel and it's passengers.<br>
    A part of the underwater hull was corroded to the extent, that seawater had 
    free access to certain tanks and void spaces. The consequence of this fact 
    was, that about 200 mts of unknown weights were in the vessel creating a 10 
    degrees list which could only be partly rectified by the ballasting of the 
    port heeling tank.<br>
    The vessel's Passengership Safety Certificate was false, the same is true 
    for her Load Line Certificate. <br>
    Trucks and cars on the car deck were not properly secured although the upcoming 
    heavy weather was known to the master. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b>Sequence-of-events </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - Due to missing rubber 
    seals and damage to it's bottom the visor became quickly filled at sea up 
    to the outside water level with seawater, which penetrated through the partly 
    open bow ramp into the car deck.<br>
    - The existing starboard list was increased by the wind pressure from port. 
    <br>
    - The vessel therefore heeled 2 to 4 degrees to starboard and the water that 
    had penetrated through the bow ramp accumulated on starboard aft of the car 
    deck as the vessel was trimmed by the stern at the commencement of the voyage. 
    <br>
    - There are indications that the crew opened the starboard stern ramp slightly 
    in an attempt to drain the car deck thereby.<br>
    - The bilge pumps were running and pumping from compartments of the 1st and/or 
    0-decks. It has to be assumed that the watertight doors in the engine room 
    area were closed, whilst the watertight doors in the passenger area of the 
    1st deck were still open after the big heel.<br>
    - At about 00.40 / 00.45 hours heavy metallic bangs were heard and felt from 
    the foreship and the movements of the vessel changed to softer pitching and 
    rolling. The metallic bangs continued. It has to be assumed that the starboard 
    hinges and side locks of the visor failed at about this time. The visor was 
    now moving forward/aft between the hinge parts on the forecastle deck and 
    the deck beam at frame 159.<br>
    - The speed was reduced and the damaged bow turned to starboard away from 
    the waves, however when the vessel started to roll excessively the bow was 
    turned back to port and wind and sea were now taken from straight ahead. The 
    vessel now made soft, deep pitch movements for a while.<br>
    - At some time later also the port hinges and the port side lock failed, whilst 
    the Atlantic lock held somewhat longer. <br>
    - At about 01.00 hours the vessel was shaken heavily and noises and vibrations 
    as if the vessel was proceeding through ice were heard and felt by those on 
    the 1st deck, shortly followed by another, even more severe impact, followed 
    by a very wide heel of the vessel to starboard at 01.02 hours The vessel, 
    however, came back to almost upright condition, heeled again, came back to 
    10-15 degrees starboard heel and subsequently heeled in steps to about 30-35 
    degrees to starboard and stabilized in this condition for some time. <br>
    - While the visor moved forward/aft and the lugs underneath the visor arms 
    were slowly cutting trough the deck beam of frame 159, both bow ramp actuators 
    broke and the unsecured ramp fell into the visor. <br>
    - After some time the lugs underneath the visor arms had worked their way 
    through the deck beam - most likely first at the port side - and the visor 
    now also moved to starboard following the increasing starboard heel and fell 
    onto the bow ramp which rested in the visor.<br>
    - In the meantime the forepeak deck had penetrated the bottom structure of 
    the visor whilst the shell plating edges were overlapping the forepeak deck.<br>
    - The visor was now held by the bow ramp and by the port side plates overlapping 
    the forepeak deck, whilst the vessel continued to heel to starboard and the 
    stern sank deeper.</font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Capsize </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- The main engines stopped 
    at about 01.10 / 01.12 hours at a heel of 25-30 degrees. At this time the 
    vessel had turned to a North-Easterly heading. <br>
    - The vessel stabilized at a heel of 30-40 degrees for some time and the diesel 
    generators stopped at about 01.15 / 01.20 hours whereafter the emergency generators 
    started and supplied power to a limited number of consumers.<br>
    - The vessel continued to heel and was on the side at 01.30 hours and some 
    time later completely upside down whilst the stern continued to sink deeper 
    and the bow to raise higher. <br>
    - It has to be assumed that the visor did glide off the bow ramp and forepeak 
    deck when the heel had reached some 130-140 degrees and sank to the bottom 
    of the sea as it was unable to float. <br>
    - The stern finally settled on the sea bottom with the bow still raised to 
    about 40-45 degrees out of the water. The bow ramp was almost closed. <br>
    - The bow sank slowly deeper and -<br>
    at 01.53 hours the echo of the ESTONIA disappeared from the radar screen of 
    the nearest vessel "MARIELLA". </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Action by the Crew</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Nothing can be stated 
    with some degree of probability from the bridge for the time after 00.35 hours.<br>
    - It has to be assumed that a first "Mayday" was transmitted at around 00.45 
    hours, which for unknown reasons was not picked up. <br>
    - It has further to be assumed that after the problems with the bow ramp and 
    visor were realised, the speed was reduced and attempts were made to take 
    the loads off the visor. <br>
    - It is likely that the crew worked on the car deck attempting to hold the 
    visor and the bow ramp to the vessel by different means. This attempt, however, 
    failed. <br>
    - There are also indications that the engine crew was working on the starboard 
    stabiliser. All attempts of the crew were apparently abandoned at about 01.00 
    hours. <br>
    - A warning for the passengers "Alarm, Alarm" was shouted in Estonian language 
    a few times over the loudspeakers. No other information was given to the passengers. 
    </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Technical Matters </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- At the time when the ESTONIA 
    was designed and built, there were no specific design requirements for visors 
    in the rules of the Classification Society Bureau Veritas. The SOLAS Convention 
    at that time was not yet part of the B.V. Rules. <br>
    - The Finnish Board of Navigation considered itself exempted from the inspection 
    of structural matters in newbuildings - such as locking devices - by the Copenhagen 
    Convention of 1924 and hence had to rely on authorised Classification Societies 
    for plan approval and inspection of structural matters on newbuildings. B.V. 
    was authorised.<br>
    - The visor design load and the assumed load distribution on the attachments 
    was in accordance with L R. Rules and the then state-of-the-art and technique.<br>
    - The visor locking devices installed by Meyer Werft, were manufactured in 
    accordance with the design and good shipbuilding practice. These devices were 
    not identical to those found onboard after the casualty. <br>
    - The SOLAS requirements for the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck were never complied with. Nevertheless Passenger Ship 
    Safety Certificates were issued by The Finnish Board of Navigation and - after 
    the vessel had changed it's flag - by B.V. on behalf of the Estonian National 
    Maritime Board. It may be debated wether the issuance of these certificates 
    during the time the vessel spent under Finnish flag was completely in line 
    with the requirements of SOLAS but that debate is irrelevant, because any 
    such failure cannot have contributed to the Catastrophe. <br>
    - The Load Line requirements for a tight vessel were not complied with on 
    9.9.1994 although BV confirmed the Load Line Certificate on this date, i.e. 
    19 days before the casualty, on behalf of the Estonian National Maritime Board. 
    <br>
    - The general maintenance standard of visor and bow ramp was unacceptable 
    which fact was the main cause for the casualty. </font></p>
