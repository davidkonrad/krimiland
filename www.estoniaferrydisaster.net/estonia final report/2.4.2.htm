<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As with DIANA II 
    the Yard had also subcontracted for VIKING SALLY the supply and installation 
    of the hydraulic arrangements and locking devices of among other things the 
    visor and bow ramp to von Tell GmbH, Sophienallee 24, Hamburg.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Von Tell GmbH, Hamburg 
    was founded in 1963 by the main shareholder of von Tell Trading & Co. AB, 
    Gothenburg, Mr. Dahlien, and the E. Rottmann KG, Hamburg. The company basically 
    acted as sales office for von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg which was 
    then acting as design/ construction office and spare-part supplier for hydraulic 
    installations, hatch covers and the like. Based on a respective contract von 
    Tell GmbH, Hamburg was obliged to order everything which they were able to 
    contract in Germany exclusively with von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg. 
    Accordingly the technicians of von Tell Trading & Co. AB worked out quotations, 
    took part in technical discussions - also at Meyer Werft - and carried out 
    all necessary calculations, furnished the respective drawings to the relevant 
    Classification Society and Maritime Administration, obtained the required 
    approvals, etc. Once the installation phase had commenced, it was the duty 
    of von Tell GmbH, Hamburg among other things to make available to the Yard 
    a qualified technician who assisted the Yard in all technical matters concerning 
    the equipment supplied by von Tell and who, at the same time, took care that 
    the parts supplied by von Tell were properly installed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to VIKING SALLY, 
    Meyer Werft ordered under order no. 3344/79-S 590 dated 27 September 1979 
    among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»1 Hydraulic 
      Installation for One Bow Visor <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      visor has an assumed weight of 56 mts and is moved by 2 directly acting 
      hydraulic cylinders. The cylinders have to be fitted with flexible bearings 
      to compensate possible misalignments. The lowering speed is to be adjusted 
      by 2 throttle non-return valves, 2 ice-breaking cylinders support the opening 
      procedure at the beginning and are softening the closing procedure at the 
      end.<br>
      Locking of the closed visor shall be hydraulically. The system has to be 
      constructed in such a way that the locking devices remain in locked position 
      even if the hydraulic is switched off. Contact switches have to be fitted 
      to the locking devices which activate the lamps at the control panel and 
      on the bridge when the locking devices are in closed position. An additional 
      device has to be supplied for the Atlantic lock. An hydraulically operated 
      fixing device has to be fitted which will be engaged at the end of the opening 
      procedure. The bow ramp has to be hydraulically interlocked against the 
      visor.<br>
      Your extent of supply for this installation is as follows:<br>
      ...................... </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
      You are further supplying the hydraulic and, as far as required, also the 
      electrical wiring diagram for the above explained movements of the visor, 
      including drawings showing arrangements of hydraulic cylinders and locking 
      devices, whereby the loads to be absorbed by vessel's construction have 
      to be stated. At non-accessible locations or at locations accessible only 
      with difficulties, automatic oil nipples have to be fitted. <br>
      ................. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above price 
      includes the furnishing of 1 technician for structural engineering for 35 
      days at normal working time and travelling to the yard and back home. Further 
      the furnishing of 1 technician free of charge for inspection and adjustment 
      of the installation.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete order 
    no. 3344/79 - S 590 is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.20.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.20.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Within the agreed 
    time frame von Tell supplied the required drawings to the Bureau Veritas plan 
    approval office in Hamburg as well as to the Yard and also supplied the ordered 
    material to the Yard for installation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The installations 
    as such were supervised by two technicians on behalf of von Tell, i.e. Günther 
    Todsen, an employee of HDW-Kiel, who was leased by von Tell whenever required, 
    and Herbert Brand from von Tell Trading & Co. AB, Gothenburg. As the major 
    part of the supervision was carried out by Todsen, his statement has been 
    taken and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a> together with an office translation. It explains in detail the 
    installation of the visor hinges and locking devices up to the final acceptance 
    of the visor documented by the so-called Receipt or Transfer Certificate signed 
    by representatives of the owners, B.V., the shipyard, and von Tell (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.22.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.22</a>). Consequently the following might be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to Purchase 
    Order No. 3344/79-S 590 dated 27.09.79, page 3, third paragraph, von Tell 
    had to supply among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>».... also 
      the control scheme for the above described movements of the bow visor including 
      drawings showing positioning of the hydraulic cylinder and locking devices 
      also quoting the loads to be absorbed by vessel's construction.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As far as can be 
    reconstructed von Tell calculated the loads developing during the opening 
    and closing of visor and also the loads on the locking devices to be absorbed 
    by vessel's construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These were apparently 
    submitted by von Tell AB, Gothenburg to and discussed with the Bureau Veritas 
    Hamburg office (see telex von Tell AB, Gothenburg to BV-Hamburg dated 18.03.80 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.4.2.23</a>). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the 
    Yard made its own calculations to ascertain the load requirements for the 
    locking devices and hinges of the visor, which were subsequently submitted 
    to von Tell and obviously approved by them (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.24.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.24</a> - 4 pages). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the then applicable 
    B.V. Rules did not contain requirements for the calculation of sea-loads on 
    visors, the Yard used the "pressure heights" stated in the so-called "Note 
    Documentaire" issued by B.V. on 05.04.1976 for these load calculations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor loads 
    assumed in the calculations as well as the way of calculating the loads to 
    be distributed to the fixing points of the visor were, however, in agreement 
    with assumed loads and calculation methods applied at that time by other Classification 
    Societies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As far as it could 
    be determined, the design load calculations were made by von Tell AB, Gothenburg, 
    on the basis of the Lloyd's Register requirements, the results were submitted 
    to BV-Hamburg (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.23</a> - telex von Tell AB, Gothenburg to BV-Hamburg dated 18.03.80) 
    and finally approved. It has not been possible to establish with certainty 
    whether the calculations made by the design office of the Yard were submitted 
    also to B.V. for examination because these calculations were just carried 
    out as a sort of internal control of what the subcontractor von Tell had calculated. 
    This is part of the standard procedure at Meyer Werft. As there is no date 
    on any of the 4 sheets of the Yard's calculations, it is unknown whether these 
    calculations actually reflect the last stage.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also 
    a recent check of what is left in the old von Tell AB files has only revealed 
    that the respective folders with the calculations for the visor locking devices 
    for both DIANA II and VIKING SALLY are empty. The memo concerning this file 
    check is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.25.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.25.</a></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
    development of the locking devices of the visor from design to production 
    and assembly on board shall be made clear by explaining in detail the sequence 
    of events from the design in Gothenburg to the production and assembly in 
    Papenburg. When evaluating the comments stated below it should be borne in

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>D. Welding Seams</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The von Tell detail 
      drawings contain remarks about the welding seam thickness in general or 
      in reference to particular parts to be welded. The Yard drawings do not 
      contain such remarks as to the thickness of welding seams for the following 
      reasons:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Meyer Werft 
      designers do not state the required thickness of welding seams individually 
      on the respective drawings, but draw up a so-called "welding table" for 
      each newbuilding. In this table the minimum thickness of welding seams for 
      particular structural parts is stated. The table is approved by the Classification 
      Society and available to all welders/foremen. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2.) In case 
      the particular structural part to be welded does not fall under the categories 
      listed in the welding table, the welder follows the Yard's general welding 
      standard.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3.) The Yard's 
      general welding standard requires for the welding of structural parts, accessible 
      from both sides, a seam thickness of minimum fifty to seventy per cent of 
      the thickness of the part to be welded. This assures that the structural 
      part to be welded to another part is connected by welding seams with a thickness 
      of at least 100% of its own cross-section. As to the welding seams connecting 
      the bushings with the lugs of the Atlantic lock on the forepeak deck they 
      were 7-8 mm thick on each side because the thickness of the lugs was 15 
      mm.</font></p>

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on 
      the original drawings, 1:10 scaled "burning sketches" were made and fed 
      into the photo-electric scanner steering the cutting machine, which subsequently 
      cut-out lugs for Atlantic lock, hinge plates and side locks, which thereafter 
      were transported to the locksmith shop. Atlantic lock lugs were 15 mm and 
      60 mm, side locks and hinge plates 60 mm. The parts of lugs and hinge plates 
      subsequently to be welded to the vessel's structure were oversized.</font></p>

      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One bushing 
      supplied by von Tell was welded into the centre and port lugs, and another 
      smaller bushing was welded into the starboard lug supported by a bracket. 
      Both bushings were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both 
      sides in accordance with Yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings 
      whilst the lugs were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the 
      von Tell representative G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he would 
      never have accepted the 3 mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains 
      of the Atlantic lugs after the casualty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After welding 
      the parts were again transported to the locksmith shop for cleaning and 
      grinding of the welds. </font></p>

      board:<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the 
      visor had been properly adjusted and fitted to its hinges, the lugs of the 
      Atlantic lock were adjusted by cutting off the oversize part as required 
      to obtain alignment with the hydraulic cylinder and closing bolt, and, also 
      with the big visor lug.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Welding of 
      the lugs and the supporting plates (also 15 mm) carrying the hydraulic cylinder 
      was performed by 7-8 mm seams at each side according to the testimony of 
      the welder and his foreman, which is confirmed by the von Tell representative 
      G.Todsen. For further details please see 2.4.6. below. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the above 
    it has to be concluded that the welds connecting the bushings with the lugs 
    of the Atlantic lock were made full load-carrying joints by using appropriate 
    manufacturing techniques, and that therefore the load carrying cross-section 
    of this locking device did satisfy the applied design and was incorporated 
    into the actual installation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It furthermore has 
    to be concluded that based on the above outlined evidence the ca. 3 mm welds 
    visible on the remains of the Atlantic lugs do not originate from the Meyer 
    Werft production and must have been laid at some later occasion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As stated above, 
    the order from Meyer Werft to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg is dated 27 September 
    1979. As the relevant parts of the visor and bow ramp were meant to be identical 
    to the DIANA II design, the first drawings were ready at an early stage and 
    sent by von Tell AB, Gothenburg to von Tell GmbH, Hamburg and from there to 
    the BV-Hamburg office for approval and to the Yard for subsequent production. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus the von Tell 
    drawing 49111-330 - 'General Arrangement of Visor and Bow Ramp' - was already 
    approved by B.V. on 5 November 1979, however, with the following remarks in 
    red handwriting: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Arrangement of 
    locking devices subject to the approval of the National Authorities." <br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(The other 
    remarks will be dealt with in the following chapter.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to this remark 
    von Tell AB wrote to the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on the 14 December 
    1979 informing them about the newbuilding and requesting details of the drawings 
    to be submitted for approval. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.27.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.27.</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">F.B.N. replied that 
    they assumed that B.V. would examine the drawings of, among other things, 
    the visor and bow ramp and that only in case the Classification Society should 
    be in doubt about the interpretation of the SOLAS Convention details by F.B.N. 
    should drawings be sent to their office. In such case the problem should be 
    clearly defined.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not exactly 
    known what von Tell AB did as a result of these comments from F.B.N. In any 
    event, according to the F.B.N. there was no more correspondence in this respect 
    in their files. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has, however, 
    to be assumed that von Tell AB spoke thereafter to B.V. Hamburg, who apparently 
    were prepared to do the approval of the locking devices as well as of the 
    surrounding ship construction. This is confirmed by the exchange of communication 
    between von Tell AB / von Tell GmbH / BV-Hamburg as stated below:</font></p>
