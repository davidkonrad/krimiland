  The hull and deck arrangement</font></b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hull was built 
    to Bureau Veritas rules and to the Load Line and SOLAS Conventions regarding 
    watertight subdivision. It was designed with a slender forebody extending 
    into a bulbous bow and a "pram type" afterbody with two propellers and two 
    rudders. Two bow thrusters were installed. The afterbody was modified during 
    drydocking in 1985 by a "duck tail" extension giving increased buoyancy in 
    the afterbody and a better hydrodynamic flow condition, preventing the stern 
    from setting down at high speed. This was a problem in the original configuration 
    unless forward located ballast tanks were filled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The forebody had 
    an extensive "flare", especially below the knuckle line at the car deck level. 
    Such flares were increasingly applied at the time to provide full width of 
    the car deck and accommodation area as far forward as possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An active roll-stabilising 
    system with fins was installed in January 1994. Provisions for such installation 
    had been made already at the newbuilding stage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hull below the 
    bulkhead deck was subdivided by fifteen watertight transverse bulkheads, equipped 
    with watertight doors as required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The double-bottom 
    spaces were arranged for fuel oils and other liquids and some were designated 
    as empty tanks. Fuel oil tanks were also placed above the inner bottom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 0, the tank 
    deck, contained : from forward - the forepeak, the bow thruster room, an extensive 
    sauna and swimming pool area, and in the aft half of the ship - the generator 
    room, the engine room, the fuel purifier room and other machinery-related 
    spaces. The deck next above, deck 1, contained - in the forward half - economy 
    class cabins for 358 passengers. The aft half of the deck contained the engine 
    control room, workshop, main engine room and various utility spaces. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car deck was 
    one open space, with the exception of a centre casing, located slightly to 
    starboard. Loading ramps were arranged one at the forward end and two at the 
    aft end of the deck. The centre casing contained staircases from the spaces 
    below the car deck, lift trunks and various utility spaces for machinery and 
    catering functions. Five lifts were installed, extending from the passenger 
    spaces below the car deck and from the car deck to deck number 7. Six sets 
    of stairs led from the lower passenger spaces to a common passageway inside 
    the casing.Four sets of stairs led from this passageway to deck 4 and six 
    sets led upwards to higher decks. Stairs were also arranged at the aft open-air 
    deck spaces from deck 4 upwards to deck 8. Emergency escape trunks from the 
    engine room area were arranged inside the casing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Smaller service spaces 
    for power supply to the ramp and bow visor operation and the hoistable car 
    decks were arranged on the car deck port and starboard, forward and aft. An 
    office for the cargo officer during loading and discharging was arranged in 
    the aft service space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 4 contained 
    many passenger cabins and, aft, conference rooms, a cafeteria and passenger 
    seats. The enclosed deck area ended at two public exits to the open-air aft 
    deck. Decks 5 and 6 had passenger cabins covering the forward third and the 
    remaining parts were used for tax free shop, information desk, restaurants, 
    bars and entertainment areas. Both decks had two double-door public exits 
    to the open-air aft decks. The accommodation spaces on decks 4, 5 and 6 extended 
    from side to side without any open-air passage or other open-air spaces except 
    the aft decks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Deck 7 contained 
    the main part of the crew accommodation. This deck did not extend to the sides 
    of the vessel, giving room for an open deck area on both sides. On the open 
    deck there were the rescue stations and the embarkation area for lifeboats. 
    The deck was accessible to passengers via two main staircases and between 
    the aft open-air decks. The passageways contained cradles for liferafts and 
    bins for lifejackets for passengers and crew. Forward on deck 8 was accommodation 
    for the senior officers and, aft, additional crew accommodation spaces. The 
    intermediate space was taken up by ventilation equipment and other service 
    functions. The lifeboat davits and additional liferaft bins were located at 
    the sides of this deck. Deck 8 was accessible to passengers only via external 
    stairs from deck 7.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The navigation bridge 
    was on deck 9. </font></p>
