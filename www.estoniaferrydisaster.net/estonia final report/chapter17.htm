<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE LOADING AND SECURING 
  OF THE CARGO</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>17.1<br>
  The Loading</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The loading 
    commenced at about 17.00 hours and was supervised by the 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu 
    assisted by some of the deckhands, such as Valdur Matt, Arne Koppel, Aulis 
    Lee and others. Subsequently also the trainee mate Einar Kukk attended.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    surviving crew members having worked on the car deck, the hanging decks had 
    not been in use and the car deck had been full with trucks and cars. Directly 
    in front of the centre casing there had been 2 garbage containers standing 
    one in back of the other towards the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The available <b>cargo 
    documentation</b> consists of the <b>cargo manifest</b> which was received 
    from the Joint Accident Investigation Commission in the early days of the 
    investigation and was said to reflect the description and numbers of trucks/trailers 
    actually loaded, see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.211</a>. Only recently the<b> freight manifest</b> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.212.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.212</a> - and the<b> customs list</b> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.213.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.213</a> - were received.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Both the cargo manifest 
    and the freight manifest initially contained 38 trucks - although in the consecutive 
    numbering a 39th and 40th truck had been included, of which the 39th was added 
    in handwriting on both manifests. The recently received customs list however 
    reveals that there were actually 40 trucks and trailers loaded. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    customs list the 40th truck, missing on the cargo manifest although the consecutive 
    number on the manifest - 43 744 - had been left open, was a Scania truck with 
    the registration no. AG 565 and with the Latvian driver Gunnar Gobins ((). 
    Since the customs list does not state dimen-sions, weight or type of cargo, 
    no more details are known. The 39th truck added to the cargo manifest in handwriting 
    under the consecutive no. 43 749 was also a Scania truck with the registration 
    no. NRY 806 and with the Swedish driver Leo Sillanpää ((). In the freight 
    manifest - Enclosure 17.1.212 - which is the cargo manifest with added freight 
    figures, both trucks are missing although the consecutive numbers 43 744 and 
    43 749 were left open. It is unknown whether this means that these trucks 
    were carried free of charge and whether this could mean that these are the 
    two trucks escorted into the port and on board by military personnel. (See 
    Subchapter 17.3.)</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> According 
      to information received from a prisoner in the jail of Vaasa/ Finland (after 
      the Luttunen interview) his friend Leo Sillanpää was the driver of a truck 
      which had plutonium hidden between the regular cargo.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is also evident 
    from the customs list that the truck or trailer no. 46 with the number plate 
    417 EEE had no driver registered. It is thus possible that this was the truck 
    or trailer which had been shipped on board the ESTONIA on the basis of incorrect 
    documents and which contained between 148 and 174 Iraqi Kurds according to 
    information from the files of the public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, Stockholm. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    statement of an Estonian lawyer, someone from Estline, Stockholm flew to Tallinn 
    by the first plane on the morning of the catastrophe, collected all the cargo 
    and passenger documentation available and flew back by next plane to Stockholm, 
    whereafter the cargo manifest was made up. According to other sources the 
    Estonian Security Police collected already in the early morning hours of the 
    28th the complete cargo documentation from the Estline office in Tallinn. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible customs 
    chief of Frihamn Terminal, Stockholm told Spiegel TV that they had always 
    received the cargo manifest on the evening of the departure by fax, which, 
    however, had not been the case on the evening of 27 September 1994. Even after 
    several reminders they received the cargo manifest only in the afternoon of 
    28 September 1994 from Estline, Stockholm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, 
    there is another 'cargo manifest' available, which, according to the print-out 
    at the top of the pages, had already been sent at 18.38 hours on 27 September 
    1994, i.e. more than 30 minutes before the departure of ESTONIA, from Estline, 
    Tallinn to presumably Estline, Stockholm. In any event, on 29 November 1994 
    it was sent by N&T to Industrietechnik, which was the old firm of Börje Stenström, 
    where he worked until his retirement in April 1995, and from whom a member 
    of this 'Group of Experts' received it in March 1995. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the contents 
    appear to be identical on both 'cargo manifests' which were made up by the 
    same E. Kurvits, the handwriting at the end of page 4 is different. This 'cargo 
    manifest' is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.214.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.214.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently there 
    were doubts from the beginning as to whether the submitted 'cargo manifest' 
    actually reflects all the trucks/trailers having been on board and these doubts 
    have now been confirmed by the customs list hidden for so long, as explained 
    on the previous page. In fact, this list was sent already on 14 October 1994 
    by fax from the Finnish Embassy, Tallinn, to the head office of the criminal 
    police, Helsinki. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The combined weight 
    of all trucks/trailers was 970 ts according to the cargo manifest - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.211</a> - and the JAIC states the total truck/trailer-weight to have 
    been 1000 t, therefore it has to be assumed that the weight of the 40th truck 
    was 30 t.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the basis of 
    these weights a stowage plan has been made up always bearing in mind that 
    as much weight as possible had to be placed on the starboard side. The stowage 
    plan is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.215.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.215 </a>and reveals that it was impossible to place enough 
    weight on the starboard side<b> to create the alleged departure condition. 
    There must have been about 200 tons of weight more at the starboard side elsewhere 
    in the ferry. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is confirmed 
    by the calculations of Shipconsulting Oy, Turku - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.194.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 17.1.194</a> - according to which there must have been about 200 
    tons more weight at the starboard side. Such a weight distribution would have 
    created a 10° starboard list without the full port - and the empty starboard 
    heeling tanks, which allegedly reduced the list to 1° starboard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to survivors 
    trucks and trailers had been more or less equally distributed between the 
    port and the starboard sides of the car deck, thus, a wrong loading of the 
    car deck cannot have been the reason for the excess weight at the starboard 
    side. Consequently it has to be assumed that there has been water in tanks 
    and/or void spaces at the starboard side which was unpumpable. The reason 
    could be that these spaces were holed and thus connected to the outside and 
    therefore could not be pumped empty at all, e.g. the starboard heeling tank.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An indication for 
    such reason could be the image from the "Mudline video", shown below which 
    was made during the diving investigation between 1 and 4 December 1994 - See 
    Chapter 27. The image evidently shows a big hole in way of the starboard hull 
    -/bottom plating area probably in way of the bilge strake. The enhancement 
    of this part of the video tape by means of special equipment confirmed that 
    the plating was indeed holed. - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Those who know about 
    this issue remain silent and so does the JAIC although they had the right 
    and obligation to ask the relevant questions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible director 
    of the technical managers and part-owners N&T, Sten-Christer Forsberg, replied 
    when being interviewed by Erik Ridder-stolpe on 10.12.97 - Q: <i>"The vessel 
    was loaded totally wrong at Tallinn?" </i>A: <i>"The wrong loading is regrettable. 
    It would, however, have happened to any other crew!"</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This indicates that 
    the "wrong loading" could have occurred independently of what the crew did 
    or could have done, i.e. it has nothing to do with the loading of the car 
    deck but was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the crew, e.g. 
    the holed bottom plating. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3"><a name="2"></a>17.2<br>
    Testimonies concerning Cargo Lashings</font></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    evidence available in respect of the securing of trucks/trailers and other 
    vehicles is naturally controversial. While the crew members testified to having 
    secured all the trucks and trailers, though in different ways, this is confirmed 
    by only very few of the truck drivers/personal car drivers. The majority of 
    the drivers state that the trucks and trailers as well as the personal cars 
    remained unsecured. The truth is probably somewhere in between, i.e. probably 
    the trailers without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to 
    the deck with belts, some additional trucks having wedges in front of and 
    behind the wheels, and a certain number of trucks coming on board last as 
    well as all vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This with certainty 
    had also been the case with the truck and trailer of <b>Per-Arne Persson </b>according 
    to his statement from which the following is quoted:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Has made at 
      least 15 trips on "Estonia". The actual voyage was made with a Volvo truck 
      , type F12, reg. no. MOW 996, with trailer no. AN 069. Persson left his 
      truck with trailer on the car deck as per drawing below which is attached 
      to his statement.</i></font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg402.jpg" width="444" height="156"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Accordingly 
      the vehicles were placed next to the forward port side of the centre casing 
      with the aft end of the trailers being only about 20 m away from the bow 
      ramp. Truck and trailer were loaded with plywood. The trucks were not secured 
      by any means, they were just standing there without any fastenings. Persson 
      did not note any other routine than on the previous voyages. As the vehicles 
      were again placed so close together that any securing was impossible, he 
      shouted to the crew: "You will never secure the trucks."«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The truck is entered 
    into the 'cargo manifest' under running no. 43773, the weight of truck, trailer 
    and plywood cargo was 55 ts, the distance to the bow ramp was only about 20 
    m and the truck was not secured because this was not possible due to the limited 
    space between the trucks. The complete statement with drawing is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.216.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.2.216.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In order to get 
    a better picture, the respective parts of the statements from crew members 
    and passengers having been on the car deck during and after the loading shall 
    be quoted below:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Einar Kukk -

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>- »I commenced 
      this additional training on the "Estonia" on 27.09.94 at 16.20 hours when 
      the loading of the trucks began. I myself was on the car deck until 18.45 
      hours. I remember that at that time all large trucks had already been taken 
      over and just the personal cars had to be loaded. The loading of those cars 
      was carried out by the 2nd mate. I can only recall his first name, Tormi, 
      his surname is unknown to me. As far as I know, he was in charge of the 
      loading. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As 
      to the question whether the vehicles loaded were secured to the vessel I 
      can reply: Each large truck was secured to the vessel. The personal cars, 
      in my opinion, were not secured, however wedges had been placed in front 
      of the wheels. I know nothing about a possible later securing. The question 
      whether I was on the car deck until the last truck had been loaded I am 
      unable to answer with certainty, because I left the deck some time before 
      the loading had been completed. <br>
      As to the question how and in what sequence the loading was carried out 
      I can reply: Loading in the port of Tallinn was performed via the bow ramp 
      by at first taking on board the heavy trucks, which were placed in the stern 
      part of the vessel and secured. Into the forepart of the vessel the smaller 
      trucks and personal cars were loaded. Into the middle part there were also 
      large and smaller trucks. <br>
      As far as I remember the car deck was full with cars.«</font></i></p>

      a rather weak lashing. A lashing which could hardly hold if the trailers

    having worked on the car deck do state that all trucks/trailers were secured, 
    whilst Einar Kukk said, the personal cars had wedges in front of the wheels, 
    Valdur Matt stated, passenger cars were not secured by wedges. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the passengers 
    including truck drivers a total of 14 stated something about parking/securing 
    their trucks/cars on the car deck, of which 10 testified that their trucks/cars 
    were not secured and also that they had not seen any other secured or properly 
    secured trucks/trailers/cars and 3 did not know or were unsure. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The conclusion 
    of this 'Group of Experts' is that it has to be assumed that the trailers 
    without own truck and the trucks loaded first were secured to the deck by 
    belts, that some additional trucks had wedges in front of and behind the wheels, 
    and that a certain number of trucks, which had come on board last, and all 
    vans and personal cars were not secured at all. This refers also to the truck/trailer 
    of Per-Arne Persson, 24 m long, 55 ts. weight and only 20 m behind the bow 
    ramp, and to the heavy garbage containers stowed between the centre casing 
    and the bow ramp and in the aft part. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are rumours 
    that Estline had informed the freight forwarders around noon of 27 September 
    1994 that bad weather had to be expected and that the cargo in/on the trucks 
    had to be secured. It is, however, unknown whether any cargo in the trucks 
    was secured at all. In any event, when the last car had rolled on board the 
    car deck was practically full and the vessel reportedly had a 1° list to starboard.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This weighs 
    particularly heavy since as of noon the south-west storm warning was known 
    to those in command of ESTONIA, i.e. the storm would be hitting the ferry 
    from port, which would increase the already existing starboard heel further. 
    Under these circumstances it would have been not only a matter of good seamanship 
    but a question of ship safety to plan the loading of the car deck in such 
    a way that there was more weight at the port side to compensate for the heeling 
    moment to be expected due to the wind pressure on the port side. See the statement 
    of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    5.3.111.</a> <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This would 
    have been of particular importance because the heeling tanks could not be 
    used to adjust the heeling to be expected. The engineer on watch in the engine 
    control room before and at the time of the casualty - Margus Treu - has consequently 
    testified in his first statement on 29.09.94 at Turku, inter alia: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The port heeling 
      tank was full, but a starboard list of 1° remained. This was, in my opinion, 
      one of the causes of the casualty, because later when the vessel was heeling 
      to starboard there was no possibility to counteract.« </i></font></p>

    Other Information</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to information 
    from Tallinn, about half an hour before the loading of the car deck was completed 
    two big trucks were escorted on board by military personnel whereby the whole 
    area around ESTONIA's berth was shut off by military forces. This was also 
    the reason why passenger Carl Övberg almost missed the ferry, because his 
    friend could not drive - as usual - to the terminal building to drop Carl 
    off in time. He just made it and as soon as he was on board the gangway was 
    pulled in - see the statement Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151.</a> Names and ranks of the soldiers having escorted the two trucks 
    on board are known to this 'Group of Experts'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly the two 
    trucks were loaded with sensitive military equipment of unknown origin which 
    were sent by the Estonian Army directly to the Swedish military for on-transport 
    to another Western country. The transport was accompanied by militaries of 
    unknown nationality who were not identified as such on the passenger list 
    respectively who were probably not even entered on the passenger list. </font></p>
