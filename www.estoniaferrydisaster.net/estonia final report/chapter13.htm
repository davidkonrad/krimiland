  CREW AND THE ADVISORS </font></b></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 27 September 
    1994 was the last day of ESTONIA in Tallinn and the 13th day of the current 
    14-day duty period of her crew - the Andresson crew. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before the 
    departure a crew list was handed over to the Harbour Master of Tallinn, which 
    according to a fax from Andi Meister to Hans Rosengren - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.186.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.186</a> - must have contained 187 names, i. e. 149 crew members on duty, 
    6 trainees, 4 crew members off duty and 28 advisors/ entertainers, although 
    in the fax it is stated that only 27 persons were listed on the advisors'/entertainment 
    list, but one more - Andrus Kullamaa - came on board after the master had 
    already signed the list, thus the second list should contain 186 names, but 
    187 persons were on board.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to a crew 
    list subsequently submitted by the Estonian part of the JAIC, however, actually 
    188 persons should have been on the crew lists of which 3 were not on board, 
    which reduces the number to 185, but 2 others were on board but not on the 
    lists, which increases the number to 187. Nevertheless the Estonian count 
    is 186 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.187.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.187</a> - which is not correct because the nautical adviser Juri Aavik 
    is nowhere mentioned.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> One of the crew 
    members off-duty was the master of the second crew, Avo Piht, who was on board 
    to be examined for his pilot exemption certificate when entering the Stockholm 
    archipelago at the Söderarm entrance. For this purpose the sea transport area 
    chief Dan Myrberg and the senior pilot of the Stockholm Pilots' Association 
    Karl-Gustav Sundius, together with their ladies, were also on board. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    files of the Stockholm public prosecutor there were in addition about 25-30 
    Pakistani workers and an unknown number of relatives of the crew on board 
    who were not registered anywhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding 
    of the professional background of the officers and ratings of the ESTONIA 
    some information about the history and the types of vessels used in the Estonian 
    merchant navy shall be presented at the beginning of this Chapter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1991 Estonia 
    as well as the other two Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania became independent 
    and the country received 3.2% of the tonnage of the former Soviet Russian 
    merchant navy fleet. This tonnage consisted mainly of several dozens conventional 
    type general cargo vessels which were mostly 20 or more years old, and which 
    were supplemented by 15 somewhat newer Ro-Ro/cargo vessels. A group of 6 large 
    and medium sized modern bulk carriers completed the fleet. Container- and 
    reefer-vessels as well as tankers were missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Some passenger/car 
    ferries employed mainly since 1991 demonstrate the restructuring process in 
    progress. Before the take-over of the ESTONIA in January 1993 the car/passenger 
    ferry GEORG OTTS - built for the Olympic Games in 1980 - was the largest Estonian 
    ferry</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">. All the sea-going 
    vessels were owned by the National Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) controlled 
    by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The members of the Board 
    of Directors were mainly high ranking civil servants from this Ministry while 
    the management consisted of previous master mariners of Estonian nationality 
    but with Russian education at the Leningrad Maritime Academy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the following 
    the vessels on which ESTONIA's first and last master, Captain Arvo Andresson, 
    obtained most of his sea-going experience, shall be introduced:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary the following 
    can be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The master and 
    senior officers received their basic education at the Leningrad Maritime Academy, 
    an Institute which is not known to impress upon its students to act and decide 
    on their own.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The juniors, 
    Tammes and Kikas, were educated in Kotka and Tallinn after the political change.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note</b>: As 
      will be seen later, it was Tammes who took the lead in the transmission 
      of the 'Mayday' calls after Ainsalu had almost spoiled the situation, and 
      although he was not on watch, he had apparently returned to the bridge on 
      his own initiative.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>Captain Arvo 
    Andresson</b> spent 101/2 of his 201/2 years at sea on a vessel of the ANTSLA 
    type, which is an old conventional cargo vessel, furthermore he was employed 
    on board of GEORG OTTS as 2nd officer for 17 months, as chief officer for 
    5 months and as master for 4 months, before he took over the ESTONIA in January 
    1993. The car/passenger ferry GEORG OTTS was exclusively employed between 
    Tallinn and Helsinki, i.e. she sailed no more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land "in sheltered waters". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    - <b>Chief officer Juhan Herma</b> had only been at sea <b>for 5 years </b>in 
    total, of which 10 months on a cargo vessel and 16 months on GEORG OTTS as 
    4th and 3rd officer, whereafter he left ESCO and sailed on INREKO ships from 
    February 1993 until August 1994 - according to the statement of ESCO - although 
    at the same time he was already 2nd officer on ESTONIA, which, of course, 
    is not possible, thus there must be something wrong.<i> Only in September 
    1994, thus shortly before the casualty, did he become chief officer. </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">-<b> 2nd officer 
    Tormi Ainsalu</b> had been at sea for 51/2 years only, of which 21/2 years 
    as sailor and 3 years as officer, 6 months of which he had been on GEORG OTTS 
    as 2nd officer before he joined ESTONIA in January 1993.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- <b>2nd officer 
    Peeter Kannussaar</b> had been at sea <b>for 3 years </b>only, of which for 
    1 year he was employed on an unknown vessel as 3rd officer and for 3 months 
    as 2nd officer on GEORG OTTS before he joined the ESTONIA in January 1993.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>3rd officer 
    Andres Tammes</b> had been at sea for <b>only 2 years</b> and 4 months as 
    sailor on a Ro-Ro cargo vessel, whereafter he attended the Kotka Marine School 
    for 2 years and signed on ESTONIA in January 1993 as 4th officer and had been 
    3rd officer since May 1994. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- <b>4th officer 
    Kaimar Kikas</b>, finally, was only 21 years old. His first and only ship 
    was the ESTONIA. He was employed for the first 12 months as AB and became 
    4th officer in January 1994.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above evaluation 
    reveals that master and senior officers were Russian educated, that only the 
    master had spent some considerable time at sea, however, that also his experience 
    with car/passenger ferries was restricted to the GEORG OTTS employed between 
    Helsinki and Tallinn, which is in no way comparable to the Tallinn-Stockholm 
    trade with ESTONIA. The chief officer as well as 2nd officer A - Tormi Ainsalu 
    - had been at sea each for about 5 years only with 16 months respectively 
    6 months on GEORG OTTS as the only car/passenger ferry experience, whilst 
    the 2nd officer B - Peeter Kannussaar - had just 3 years at sea, of which 
    3 months on GEORG OTTS before he joined ESTONIA. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be 
    concluded that neither the master nor the nautical officers had had any previous 
    experience with a comparable vessel when they joined the ESTONIA and that 
    the only one with considerable sea experience was Captain Arvo Andresson, 
    whilst all the others, including the chief officer and the 2nd officer A, 
    could only be considered junior officers. </font></p>

    careers of the engineers it has to be concluded that the senior engineers,

    than were the nautical officers, with the exception of Captain Andresson.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Not much can 
    be said about the radio operator. He appears nowhere and also the statement 
    of ESCO about the dates of his professional carrier must at least be partly 
    wrong. Some information was received from the Maritime Department of the Polytechnic 
    Kotka, which is attached as Enclosure 13.189.</font></p>
