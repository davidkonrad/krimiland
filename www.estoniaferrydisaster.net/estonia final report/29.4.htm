  The Bulbous Bow</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">This most 
    forward part of the vessel has been unusually carefully examined at least 
    three times by ROVs and at least one time by divers.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Numerous 
    deep scoring marks with paint cracked off in way of the ice-knife on top of 
    the bulbous bow and further forward were noted, which most probably were sustained 
    when the forward part of the visor was in contact with these areas. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thus the bulbous 
    bow and the ice-knife on top had been in contact with the visor and possibly 
    something else which caused a number of scorings and an indentation to these 
    very strong parts of the ferry. Nevertheless, they were examined quite closely 
    by the ROV and divers, and the images below are just a small selection of 
    the material available. They show on picture 1 the tip of the bulbous bow 
    with some minor rubbing marks. Picture 2 shows the top slightly further aft 
    with some scorings and picture 3 shows the top even further aft with the paint 
    in the centre completely gone.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the 
    image below showing white contact marks on the port lower side approximately 
    1.5 m aft of the tip of the bulbous bow. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image 
    shows white contact marks on the port side of the bulbous bow further aft 
    than the previous one. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The pictures do confirm 
    contact with some object which could have been quite strong considering the 
    very strong construction of the bulbous bow, i.e. a weaker construction might 
    have sustained heavy damage due to contact with the strong bulbous bow as 
    indicated by the above paint and scoring marks. </font></p>
