<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the evening of 
    17.09.94, i.e. 10 days before ESTONIA's last departure from Tallinn, a Swedish 
    passenger was standing on the forward open part of deck 7 and filmed the closing 
    of the visor, the handling of the mooring lines by the deck crew and, finally, 
    he zoomed in on the starboard visor hinges. The first copy of the original 
    film was made available to this 'Group of Experts' and a first internal analysis 
    revealed that the starboard visor hinge was in an absolutely disastrous condition 
    as can be seen on the image below. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The results are 
    summarised in the<i> Report on the Loss of the Ro-Ro Ferry "Estonia"</i> - 
    attached as Enclosure 12.5.180 and shall be briefly commented as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The object of the 
    report was to detect and identify any structural rupture or damage which could 
    have contributed to the loss of the Ro-Ro ferry ESTONIA. For identification 
    of components bracketed numbers, for example (5) in the text refer to annotations 
    on the drawings, on the previous page. A detailed examination of the video 
    tape showed the only damage to be identified limited to the starboard visor 
    hinge.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inner visor 
    hinge plate (2) is correct and straight on its fore and aft axis other than 
    a section of approximately 150 mm between the vertical centre line of bolt 
    (10) and the aft end of the visor arm (1). This section has a clockwise twist 
    which gives a downward inclination to the visor bolt (10) and the inner steel 
    bushing surrounding it (7). This inclination of the bolt assembly (10) and 
    the steel bushing extends from its inner end to the outer face of the vessel 
    hinge plate (5). The video image does not allow a precise calculation of this 
    angle, but the average of a series of measurements show it to be approximately 
    4 degrees which gives a downward misalignment of the axis at bolt(10) of approximately 
    25 mm at the starboard face of the vessel's outer hinge plate (5). In addition 
    there are two unexplained dark marks on each side of the inner hinge plate 
    (2) opposite each other at the point it joins the bolt assembly (10). These 
    two marks appear to be joined by a thin line extending across this section 
    of the inner Visor Hinge Plate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> An aft section of 
    approximately 400 mm of the outer visor hinge plate (3) together with the 
    outer steel bushing it carries has a significant rotation in an anti clockwise 
    direction on its fore and aft axis. The whole assembly is visibly rotated 
    to such an extent that both its inner and outer ends can be seen on the video 
    image as an ellipse. This is in marked contrast to the inner bushing assembly 
    (7) which is symmetrical to the axis of the bolt (10) as seen in Makers drawings 
    590/1106. There is another disruption to the bolt assembly, i.e. the outer 
    steel bushing (8) is shown on the hinge plate (3) while the video print shows 
    it to be misplaced outwards by approximately 80 mm. The steel bushing (8) 
    extends further than the portion on the inner side of the outer visor arm 
    although it should be identical as seen on Drawing 590/1106. Taking account 
    of all these situations it is apparent that considerable disturbances have 
    taken place in this area. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the video 
    image a significant linear difference is apparent along the axis of bolt (10) 
    at its interfaces with outer steel and bronze bushing at the outer side of 
    the vessel hinge plate (5). In this area the video image shows a significant 
    fact. The base of the outer visor arm casing (1) can be clearly seen at deck 
    level and can also be seen in a gap of approximately 25 mm between the vessel's 
    outer hinge plate (5) and the outer steel bushing (8). According to Makers 
    Drawing this should not be possible, as the bushing (8) should obstruct this 
    view. In addition to this nothing can be seen of the fixed bushing (6) beyond 
    the face of the outer vessel hinge plate (5) from which it should protrude 
    by 5 mm nor can the 5 mm distance ring which should be between the outer hinge 
    plate and the outer steel bushing. There is a further significant fact, approximately 
    150/160 degrees for the bronze and steel bushing (8) is missing from the lower 
    section of the Bolt Assembly (10). From the video image it is clearly visible 
    that the securing plate (9) is totally missing and that the bolt (8) is not 
    in place where it should be, and that only 2 of the 4 securing plate bolts 
    (11) are in position and are sticking out of the outer steel bushing (8). 
    These are either studs from which the nuts have been forced off or bolts nuts 
    with the heads broken off.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary the following 
    has to be concluded:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This Report is based 
    on Video Tape Images showing disruption to the structure of the Ferry "Estonia", 
    especially in the area of the Starboard Hinge Plates (2) and (3), and on the 
    Bolt Axis (10). This damage is very significant, especially so when the components 
    involved form part of a load bearing assembly liable to operate in heavy sea 
    conditions. </font></p>

    Structure Analysis of the Bow Ramp Hinges<br>
    by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The JAIC has stated 
    on page 175 of their Final Report:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»After the 
      ramp had been forced open by the visor, waves may have caused the ramp to 
      move between fully open and partly closed position, but generally a significant 
      opening was available for waves to enter the car deck as further described 
      in 13.5 below. The large amounts of water flooding onto the car deck caused 
      the vessel to heel over and after a few rolling movements a significant 
      list developed to starboard. This happened within the first minutes after 
      the visor had separated from the ship. It is, however, the opinion of the 
      Commission that full service speed setting was maintained right up to the 
      time when the list developed.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    according to the JAIC the bow ramp had been fully open for some time when 
    the vessel was still on full service speed at a significant wave height of 
    between 3.5 - 4.5 m, which included the 7 m wave, from about 30° on the port 
    bow. <br>
    Therefore the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg was requested to calculate 
    the water column necessary to break all four intact hinges of the bow ramp. 
    The result was that <b>a static load corresponding to 6 m water </b>- but 
    without the influence of about 14 kn speed - would break all four sound hinges<b>. 
    As the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle already at around midnight, 
    it can be excluded that the bow ramp would have remained connected to the 
    vessel by the hinges</b> in particular if the vessel was making a speed of 
    about 14 kn against bow seas.<br>
    As explained in the previous Subchapters 6.5, 12.4 and 12.5, however, the 
    severely pre-damaged <b>port outer hinge </b>of the bow ramp<b> had collapsed 
    </b>presumably already in March 1994 and the ramp became detached from the 
    vessel and most probably subsequently <b>also the port inner hinge</b> broke, 
    leaving the <b>starboard inner and outer hinges.<br>
    </b>Calculations of the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg have revealed 
    that in case the ramp was just connected to the vessel by the port inner, 
    the starboard inner and the starboard outer hinges a <b>static load of 4 m 
    water</b> would have been sufficient to break off the ramp not taking into 
    account <b>the additional effect of a speed of 14 kn,</b> and if the ramp 
    <b>had been connected just by the starboard inner and outer hinges</b> - which 
    was the most likely scenario - a static load of only 2.5 m is required to 
    break off the ramp, again, not considering the effect of the speed.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As it has been 
    proved with certainty - Subchapter 12.4 - that the port outer bow ramp hinge 
    was broken and the ramp detached from the vessel many months before the casualty, 
    which was confirmed by the damage picture of the ramp after the casualty, 
    it can be concluded that the bow ramp would have broken off completely had 
    it been fully open shipping water with a significant wave height of between 
    3.5 - 4.5 m (7 m) on the port bow and with the vessel making a speed of about 
    14 kn. <br>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Breakload calculations 
    by means of the Finite Element method revealed that the total force required 
    for both sides was approximately 2000 KN, however to penetrate the deckbeam 
    at frame 159 a force of about 2800 KN was necessary. It has thus to be concluded 
    that it has theoretically been possible for the lugs underneath the visor 
    arms to break through the deckbeam at frame 159. It has not been the subject 
    of this investigation to determine whether breaking through the deckbeam is 
    reflected in the damage picture of the lugs underneath the visor arms. The
