  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation of 
    all the statements taken by the Estonian, Swedish and Finnish police as well 
    as the statements subsequently taken by members of this 'Group of Experts' 
    and/or others reveal that 133 survivors have testified, some several times 
    and sometimes differently.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Only 45 of 
    them have stated the exact or approximate time of the big heel to starboard, 
    when everybody realised that it was then getting serious.<br>

        hours : 4 <br>

        or 01.02 hours : 25 <br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since the electric 
    clock of passenger Mikael Öun fell off the table at the big heel and the batteries 
    became disconnected, the clock stopped at this very moment <b>at 00.02 hours 
    Swedish time = 01.02 hours ship's time. </b>This is supported by the obvious 
    fact that 25 of the 45 have stated the time of the heel to have been about 
    01.00 hours. It is further confirmed by the evidence of Wanda Wachtmeister 
    who looked at her wristwatch after she had reached the 7th deck from the 4th 
    deck and the time was 01.05 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>It can thus 
    be reasonably assumed that the big heel occurred at 01.02 hours ship's time. 
    </b></font></p>

    The Righting Up after the Big Heel</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thirty survivors 
    have repeated that this big heel was up to 45° or more degrees and that the 
    vessel had almost righted up again, while approximately 40 others have indicated 
    a very big and rapid heel without stating that the vessel came back up. This 
    as well as many other uncertainties in the statements are doubtlessly due 
    to the survivors having been mai</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">nly 
    asked by policemen untrained for the questioning of witnesses after maritime 
    casualties.</font> </p>
