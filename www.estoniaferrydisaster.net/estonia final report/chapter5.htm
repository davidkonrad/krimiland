  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b><font size="4">II NORDSTRÖM 
    & THULIN AND THE STOCKHOLM-TALLINN SERVICE</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="4"><b> CHAPTER 5</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nordström & Thulin 
    AB is a Stockholm-based public company, established in 1850, with extensive 
    experience in the worldwide operation of large modern tankers and bulk carriers. 
    Also passenger ferry operations between the Swedish mainland and the island 
    of Gotland in the Baltic Sea belonged to the business and shipbroking is another 
    important company activity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of 
    the changes in the Soviet Union in 1988 the Board of Nordström & Thulin (N&T) 
    decided to investigate the possibilities for a car/ passenger service between 
    Stockholm and Tallinn and in early spring 1989 Hans Laidwa, a born Estonian, 
    took up his work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Laidwa's business 
    was to investigate the possibilities of opening a ferry traffic between Stockholm 
    and Tallinn. N&T's plans had a positive response in Stockholm and Tallinn, 
    but the decisions - as far as Estonia was concerned - at that time were still 
    being made in Moscow. The Soviet authorities would among other things have 
    to tolerate that passengers on short cruises to Tallinn would not need visas, 
    which was finally accepted.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T received the 
    exclusive right for the passenger traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm from 
    the Estonian side for a guaranteed period of 10 years. This was necessary 
    for the long-term planning of investments, because N&T had to take care of 
    all investments in vessels, in terminals and project preparations and also 
    to conduct the ferry line with own personnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For the new activities 
    N&T formed the company N&T Estline AB, and appointed Hans Laidwa its managing 
    director. The Danish passenger ferry MV DANA REGINA, which for many years 
    had been employed in the traffic between Copenhagen and Oslo, was purchased, 
    renamed NORD ESTONIA and put under Swedish flag. The ferry left Stockholm 
    on 16 June 1990 on her historical first tour and a very euphoric summer was 
    commenced. The picture of the city of Tallinn was changing and many of the 
    Soviet restrictions were breaking down through the influence of the numerous 
    tourists visiting the city. The first song festival after 50 years took place 
    without approval from Moscow and it was the first time in 50 years that people 
    from all over Estonia could meet friends and relatives from other parts of 
    the country.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the summer 
    of 1990 a difficult time began, and with the darkness and cold of winter came 
    harder political signals which culminated in the bloody events in Vilnius 
    and Riga in January 1991 and also the Estonians were prepared to build barricades 
    and to fight for their independence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To this dark picture 
    also contributed the murder of two Swedish union leaders in Tallinn. MV NORD 
    ESTONIA was more or less sailing empty during the winter and spring of 1991, 
    a situation which only gradually changed in the less than 2 years that the 
    NORD ESTONIA would remain in this service. </font></p>

    He was practically the Fleet Manager directly responsible to the Managing

    after the NORD ESTONIA had taken up her service to Tallinn. Hobro had been

        route between Stockholm and Tallinn, Sjöfartsverket issued and annually 
        renewed an unrestricted PSSC, thereby confirming that she did comply with

        of N&T has also engaged personnel from the independent entity Rederi AB 
        Hornet, e.g. for technical follow-up work on board. This situation is 
        not unusual. In the shipping business it is more the rule than the exception 
        that part of owners' employees are engaged from ship management companies.
