    The Survivors' Statements </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">As stated before, the non-classified 
    statements were copied from the files of the Swedish JAIC in January/February 
    and sent in bundles to Hamburg. All statements were in the Swedish language, 
    i.e. the original Finnish and Estonian statements were already translated 
    into Swedish. See also Subchapter 36.5.<br>
    It took almost 3 months to analyse and evaluate the statements. The result 
    was astonishing as the hypothetical sequence-of-events of the JAIC did not 
    at all match with the statements of the survivors. It follows that the JAIC 
    had disregarded the passengers' statements and just relied on the testimonies 
    of the crew members, in particular, of Silver Linde and Margus Treu. <br>
    Note: Chapter 21.2 demonstrates the "reliability" of these statements. <br>
    The summary and evaluation of all statements, the changed sequence-of-events 
    and cause consideration as well as the conclusions resulting therefrom were 
    submitted - together with a summary of the technical findings in a 87-page 
    letter dated 22 July 1996 to Börje Stenström with copy to the Finnish part 
    of the JAIC. <br>
    Stenström wrote a few comments by the letter of 30 September, however, the 
    Finnish part of JAIC never did reply to this letter. The letter is attached 
    as Enclosure 39.4.471. It was classified by the Swedish part of the JAIC on 
    02.08.96 and declassified again on 06.03.98 - 14 months after the publication 
    of the Final JAIC Report. </font></p>

  <p align="center"> <b><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">39.5<br>
    Communication and Investigation as from April 1996 </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: Since the beginning 
    of 1996 the Finnish Environment Agency was preparing the removal of the fuel 
    oil from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA. This should be carried out by sophisticated 
    ROVs, able to cut holes into the vessel's side. The heavy fuel should then 
    be heated and sucked out by means of equipment which could, however, only 
    be used up to wind force 3-4 Bft. As this meant that there would be quite 
    some idle time at sea for the vessel "HALLI" from board of which the ROV was 
    operated, Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish part of the JAIC 
    took the chance to stay onboard at those idle times and used the ROV for examinations 
    of interesting parts of the wreck. See Chapter 28. This 'Group of Experts' 
    was kept closely informed and even asked what they wanted to have examined. 
    Thus a fax with various points of interest was sent to Tuomo Karppinen on 
    18 April - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.472.htm" target="_blank">39.5.472</a>. 
    Tuomo Karppinen also wrote down in a memo which items the Finnish part of 
    the JAIC would like to have examined and as it is revealed from the memo that 
    their requirements went much farther than those of this 'Group of Experts'. 
    Also Börje Stenström wanted more and better pictures from the wreck when he 
    wrote by fax of 15 April to Tuomo Karppinen: <br>
    "re: Pictures from 'Estonia'. <br>
    After some consideration I can still see the necessity for us to try to get 
    better pictures from the damage to the deck and the front bulkheads, inclusive 
    of pictures through the holes in the vessel. Furthermore, close-ups of the 
    electric cables to the sensors of the bottom lock, in particular the free 
    ends and the backside of the plate to which the sensors had been mounted."" 
    <br>
    See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.474.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.474. </a></font></p>
  <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">He should have remembered 
    that the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables had been cut off in 
    his presence by the divers in December 1994 - see <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    27</a> - and thrown away. <br>
    Since it was one of the really urgent requirements of this 'Group of Experts' 
    to have an own look at the wreck the Finnish part of the JAIC was requested 
    to permit a member of this 'Group of Experts' to attend one of the planned 
    ROV surveys. This was however at once and categorically rejected. Nevertheless 
    Karppinen and Rahka kept reporting on these ROV inspections, for example Karppinen 
    on 29 April: <br>
    "The water was so dirty that the ROV operators refused to put their equipment 
    into the water in order not to endanger it. All the time the Norwegian M.V. 
    "TERTNES" was dropping sand and rocks into the water only 100 m away from 
    the wreck, therefore the visibility was zero. "TERTNES" left on Sunday and 
    will return only in June. They will make another attempt by ROV next weekend. 
    So far they have searched the whole wreck except for the extreme aft and found 
    nothing - no hole cut into the side."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Börje Stenström, whose 
    health was continuously deteriorating, complained bitterly about the Estonians 
    who still had not delivered anything, thus the Swedes had practically taken 
    over everything from them. Enn Neidre was replaced by Pritt Mänik. He stated, 
    that they had accepted our letter of 22.01.96, also the plugging of the bow 
    ramp by the crew and it will be included into their report. He was aware of 
    the fact that the Estonian witnesses were lying to them and did not tell the 
    full story, however, "What can we do?" <br>
    Note: They should have listened to the surviving passengers. <br>
    He did not read the Hellberg book, but others in the Commission have and feel 
    that the yard is "treated quite well". When the gap in the bow ramp was further 
    discussed, it turned out that the gap was now apparently an admitted fact. 
    Stenström also spoke about the interlock between visor and bow ramp and it 
    turned out that he believed that the visor could only be closed if the bow 
    ramp was properly closed and locked. He was informed that the visor could 
    be almost closed (for painting purposes) if the bow ramp was fully open. Also 
    the water in the visor and on car deck was discussed and the passenger video. 
    Stenström was informed in detail about the missing material at the starboard 
    hinge compared to the port hinge. Stenström further informed that their report 
    was still not ready and that they would send the draft to N&T, ESCO, B.V. 
    and the yard before it would be finalized so that all parties involved would 
    have a last chance to comment on their respective parts. Stenström further 
    advised that they believed to have enough evidence to evaluate their case, 
    but if any diving on the wreck would be done they would certainly want to 
    examine certain things. Compared to the Part-Report they had "softened" the 
    Final Report not to put more or too much blame on the yard. They did not get 
    the information about the officers from the Estonians which they need. They 
    cannot even blame them for the speed. He will send the draft report next week. 
    Margus Treu has said that the watertight doors were open. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">June: During a telephone 
    conversation on the 5th Klaus Rahka advised that he would go out by tug to 
    M.V. "HALLI" tonight, to attend another ROV inspection of the wreck. They 
    had a meeting of the technical group, i.e. B. Stenström, T. Karppinen, Metsaveer 
    and Ingerma, M. Huss and himself. The atmosphere was quite relaxed and it 
    seems that they do accept a break load of 175 ts for the side locks now. <br>
    Subsequently Rahka wrote as follows:<br>
    "With respect to doing a test including weaker than actual weldments we seem 
    to share an interest toward a test, because that would be the only practical 
    way to find the magnitude of an extreme minimum strength of a lock of this 
    general configuration. As it is now - estimates of minimum strength have only 
    been made analytically, and we see a strong chance that these estimates inevitably 
    produce low values for the strength estimates. The forepeak structure is high 
    quality FE 37-type steel, which thanks to its high ductility could work to 
    even out loads between the three lugs, thus raising the result above that 
    obtainable by calculation only. Technically it would thus be valuable to determine 
    the behaviour of such a structure, because the assumptions underlying the 
    analytical calculations most likely underestimate load sharing between the 
    three lugs. An experiment would be the only reliable way to find how much 
    this technical minimum is larger than the analytical estimate." <br>
    Such a test was subsequently also carried out and for details see Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.3</a> and 39.2. The complete fax is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.475.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.475</a>. <br>
    On 8 June SVENSKA DAGBLADET published an interview with Olof Forssberg of 
    which some parts are quoted below: <br>
    "There is no guarantee that the Commission's report will be completed by the 
    2nd anniversary of the casualty. This was said by Olof Forssberg, chairman 
    of the Swedish part of the International Commission.<br>
    The delay of the report is a disappointment for many relatives. On the 2nd 
    anniversary the liability of the owners for the casualty becomes time barred 
    and the relatives had stated that they need the report of the Commission to 
    sue the owners. <br>
    It cannot wait </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">F: As there is a time-bar 
    period of 2 years the relatives cannot sit and wait for our report. They have 
    to commence legal proceedings on basis of own material, said Olof Forssberg. 
    <br>
    SvD: Why is the report so much delayed? From the beginning it ha been said 
    that it should come out 1 year after the catastrophe. Now it is uncertain 
    whether it will be ready on the 2nd anniversary.<br>
    F: It has to be borne in mind that we here in Sweden cannot do everything 
    in the commission. This is actually an International Commission with an Estonian 
    chairmanship. <br>
    F: There are always difficulties if one is working in a commission with leaders 
    from 3 different nations and if one is an own national commission. There is 
    hardly a subject which due to the language does not lead to delays and complications. 
    <br>
    Discussions about selection of words<br>
    F: The text is read and everybody has to agree, and that takes time. Always 
    discussions remain about the selection of particular words, in particular 
    in the judgement of people and people's behaviour, i.e. that the words have 
    to be chosen very carefully.<br>
    SvD: It has been said that the delay is due to disagreement within the commission? 
    <br>
    F: This I deny categorically. <br>
    SvD: Is there agreement between the delegates of Estonia, Sweden and Finland? 
    <br>
    F: In case we do not agree, we are writing our different opinions. Because 
    majority decisions are not allowed, we have to reserve our rights. <br>
    SvD: About a year ago the commission submitted a part-report concerning the 
    technical aspects of the casualty only. The behaviour of the crew shall be 
    dealt with only in the final report.<br>
    Olof Forssberg is today neither confirming nor denying information concerning 
    missing initiative of the Estonian crew.<br>
    SvD: What is your opinion about the picture of the master as outlined by the 
    journalists Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle in their book about the catastrophe? 
    The master is said to have been authoritarian and incompetent. <br>
    F: Talks with pilots show a different picture. There is much different information 
    about the master.<br>
    SvD: When 'Estonia' got the list, however, the master choose to turn to port 
    which increased the list?<br>
    F: Theoretically, it would have been better to turn to the other side. It 
    is, however, not so easy just to say that the master turned to the wrong side. 
    It is often so that in case of a list this side is turned into the sea, exactly 
    as the master did.<br>
    Bad Repairs<br>
    SvD: The yard which built the 'Estonia' is alleging that N&T neglected the 
    condition of the vessel and postponed necessary repairs. Can you reject this 
    allegations?<br>
    F: We shall comment on this in our final report, said O. Forssberg and added 
    that the German yard has "a number of theories at the present time". He pointed 
    out that the yard e.g. was interested in a Russian report which alleges that 
    the casualty was a result of the ferry having been used as a smuggle ship. 
    <br>
    SvD: Do you mean that the yard is looking for any straw to find an explanation 
    which would release her from liability?<br>
    F: We get the impression that they are trying to do that. <br>
    SvD: How was it to investigate the largest civil casualty in Europe in modern 
    times? <br>
    F: - Many times people are of the opinion that because so many have lost their 
    lives there must be a rather complicated cause for the casualty. There can, 
    however, be a rather banal accident even if the consequences are disastrous.<br>
    - It is easy to conclude that a lot of people must also have made a lot of 
    mistakes. Sometimes however life is quite simple such as that an accident 
    occurs. <br>
    SvD: Will the theories and speculations come to an end once your final report 
    is submitted?<br>
    F: No, because we have no access to the wreck the rumours will continue to 
    live. This was the same with the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg, Dag Hammarsköld's 
    air plane casualty and the murder of Olof Palme - theories are coming and 
    emerging in uniform distances." <br>

    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 13 June Klaus Rahka informed 
    that the ROV inspection of the wreck had brought nothing. It might be repeated 
    but Kari Lethola wants a diving investi-gation. Finnish divers had made an 
    offer already and one diver can work on site for about 20 minutes. One job 
    will be to closely film the sensor plate and the free ends of the cables of 
    the Atlantic lock sensors, however the wish list of this 'Group of Experts' 
    would also be favourably considered. Rahka was informed that his proposal 
    to make a further break test with tack-welds had been accepted and the test 
    was already being prepared. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">July: In early July the evaluation 
    of the many statements of the survivors was completed and based on the noise 
    and time scenarios revealed from these statements, a new casualty scenario 
    was developed which differed considerably from that of the JAIC. The present 
    stage of the technical investigation by this 'Group of Experts' including 
    the interpretation of the passenger video, the summaries and evaluations of 
    all survivor statements and the consequently newly developed casualty scenario 
    and cause consideration were - as stated before - submitted to Stenström with 
    copies to the Finnish JAIC. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.4.471.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.4.471.</a> <br>
    While in the Swedish and Estonian media a squabble was carried out between 
    Andi Meister/Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg and other Swedish JAIC members and 
    experts, the rumours that Andi Meister would resign from the JAIC were growing 
    and, indeed, on 30 July he resigned. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström commented 
    this as follows: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi Meister was already 
    very tired at the last meeting and had indicated that he was considering to 
    retire. They believe that the Estonian complaints about the Swedes withholding 
    evidence was just an excuse to create a break in the commission which, however, 
    would not be permitted by the politicians on both sides. The Estonians were 
    apparently under growing internal pressure to avoid what becomes more and 
    more obvious viz. that the main blame lies with the management and crew and 
    that the evidence given by the Estonian crew members is wrong. Stenström further 
    said, that he had a lot of material at home which was not even registered. 
    See also <a href="chapter35.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 35.7</a>. He declared 
    not to have the repair list for the bow ramp damage. He was told by chief 
    engineer H. Moosaar (of the 2nd crew), Hobro and Rasmusson that the copy remained 
    onboard. That was clear, however, where was the original? No reply. </font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">August: The diver videos 
    and three amateur videos were received, viewed and evaluated which took time 
    and the further development and discussion of the new casualty scenario took 
    even more time. Sweden and Finland were on vacation. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">September: On 5 September 
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' met with the Finnish part of the JAIC 
    in Helsinki when a copy of the passenger video was handed over - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    39.3 </a>- and all subjects were discussed. It turned out that the JAIC trusted 
    the model test results of SSPA more than the reports of the survivors and, 
    further, maintained their initial findings and casualty scenario in spite 
    of all the contradictory evidence submitted to them by this 'Group of Experts' 
    and others. The results of the meeting are summarized in a memo and because 
    this was the last meeting with the JAIC the conclusions shall be quoted a 
    follows: <br>
    <i>"Tuomo Karppinen, who is obviously in overall charge of the evaluation 
    of statements, is very uncertain and unsure. He was apparently following instructions 
    when submitting the scenario explained under 1.8. without creating the impression 
    of being entirely convinced himself. In addition, he obviously has not yet 
    carried out a detailed evaluation of the statements, which is really necessary 
    to understand the full background. The obvious fact that his nautical experience 
    is limited to some yachting does not make it easier. Consequently, it again 
    has to be concluded that the Commission is still not doing the required work 
    as it has to be and can be expected with a case of this dimension. It is not 
    enough to explain all indications of an early starboard list with "but the 
    seas continued to strike from port side until the visor fell off."</i><br>
    It has to be decided now whether we shall spend some more time in explaining 
    to them in more detail why the starboard list must have occurred much earlier, 
    etc. The next Commission meeting is at the end of September. They will under 
    all circumstances complete their report before Christmas, even if it should 
    not contain the latest stage of the investigation. The pressure from government 
    side is said to be very severe." <br>
    By letter of 30 September Börje Stenström commented on some of the issues 
    raised in the letter of this 'Group of Experts' but no word abut the survivors' 
    statements and the resulting new casualty scenario. <br>
    Since 24 September Uno Laur was the chairman of the JAIC. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">October: The exchange of 
    information by fax and telephone between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' 
    continued and some time was spent with the discussion of the statements of 
    ex-boatswain Luttunen, who testified that the three lugs of the Atlantic lock 
    on the forepeak deck had been renewed in 1982/83, most probably by von Tell 
    AB, Gothenburg. The JAIC did not accept the statement of Luttunen, because 
    it was not confirmed by other crew members having been onboard with him. It 
    led, however, to an analysis of the paint layers of the starboard lug and 
    the visor lug which revealed that the basic primer of the starboard lug was 
    grey and of the visor lug was yellow. As the basic primer of the foreship 
    at the newbuilding stage had been yellow, this analysis result confirms the 
    Luttunen statement, but even despite such improved knowledge the statement 
    was still disregarded by the JAIC.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> November: The JAIC had a 
    commission meeting for three days in Stockholm from 19-21 November at which 
    24 persons attended, among them Enn Neidre - who as the reader will recall 
    - had officially resigned from the JAIC. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.5.477.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.5.477</a> - List of Attendants. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">December: Following the above-mentioned 
    meeting various JAIC members and experts made different statements to the 
    media, and the yard was again attacked. Soon thereafter Börje Stenström wrote 
    an apologetic fax to Dr. Holtappels, which is quoted as follows: <br>
    "You will no doubt learn through your press monitoring about what was going 
    on in Stockholm during the past days. A radio channel reporter had talked 
    to an outside expert, getting the impression that there were additional facts 
    about the locking mechanisms beyond what is mentioned in the Part-Report. 
    This led to activities in several other media including two TV channels by 
    which I have been interviewed. I stated repeatedly in the interviews that 
    we do not point out who installed the lock attachments of their current dimensions. 
    Unfortunately this was now picked up in only one of the broadcasts, but rather 
    an impression that it was now more clear than before that the yard had installed 
    undersized lockings. <br>
    Lawyer Witte was also interviewed and claimed quickly that chances to sue 
    the yard will now increase. I will call Witte Tuesday morning to explain to 
    him that his conclusions are not based on facts of our report, on the contrary 
    we will remain silent on the issue of who may have installed the weak parts." 
    <br>

    <br>
    Changes in the JAIC</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Estonian chairman Andi 
    Meister resigned on 30.07.96. The chairmanship had been offered to Kari Lethola 
    and to Olof Forssberg, however, was rejected by both of them as the Prime 
    Ministers of Estonia, Finland and Sweden had decided on 28 September 1994 
    that the chairman should be Estonian. Only in the course of September did 
    Uno Laur accept the appointment and took over the chair on 24 September. Already 
    on 30.07.96, the day of Andi Meister's resignation, Heino Jaakula - from the 
    Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.) - was appointed as member. <br>
    In April Enn Neidre had already resigned from the JAIC upon pressure from 
    Sweden and Finland caused by the remarks of Dr. Holtappels (see Chapter 38.4). 
    As stated above Neidre was replaced by Pritt Männik, but remained an expert 
    to the Estonian JAIC and participated in this capacity full scale in the JAIC 
    work including the drafting of the Final Report. The initial judgement that 
    the JAIC was biased due to its Estonian members remains upheld. <br>
    The Finnish expert Simo Aarnio passed away on 22.01.96 and was replaced by 
    Kari Larjo on 27.02.96. <br>
    There were considerably more changes to come which will be explained in the 
    following chapter 40.</font></p>
