    Further Evidence</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In the meantime the available 
    ROV/diver videos B 40 b, c, e have been analysed with regard to the voice 
    communication between those concerned with directing and controlling the ROV 
    supposed to enter the car deck, the divers inspecting the bow ramp and their 
    supervisor. The identities of the persons involved is unknown and they are 
    thus referred to as:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C = controller<br>
    C 2 = controller 2 <br>
    V1 = Scandinavian voice DC = diver controller<br>
    V2 = ROV controller D = diver <br>
    V3 = unknown voice </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: The ROV has started descending. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: I see the fact but still 
    we were inside here and we together we took measurements of 73.5 metres and 
    65.5 we did it ourselves.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> V: I'll come back up again, 
    we are obviously going round in circles. I don't know exactly where exactly 
    where we are, it doesn't make much sense for us to keep going down all the 
    time.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> V1: There is diver...That's 
    down below that's the one took this afternoon on the video so now we follow, 
    we follow that one inside.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: The ROV is now heading 
    in again. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: This is heading in again. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: We are now inside.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> V1 We go in. The diver is 
    so belaying this, that is good....seven zero meter, can we then go back to 
    the divers and check our depth. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Here's the diver. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: That's the diver he is 
    working at 70 meters.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> ----- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: Just continuing to move 
    inside the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> V1: Should come lower.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: Just continuing inside 
    the car deck just finding some debris. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: That's mud. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: A lot of mud built up. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: That's not sediment. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: It's identified not as 
    sediment but definitely mud, large build up of mud. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: There appears to be outside 
    the vessel now having become disorientated while entering the car decks. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: We are under the bow 
    section. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">----- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: Now we just re-entered 
    the car deck area.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: Now going to clear the 
    ROV tether and attempt re-entry into the car deck area from a known reference 
    point.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: The ROV is now going 
    to attempt to re-enter the car deck, this time with the assistance of the 
    divers. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: We're at the diver now. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: If you just go straight 
    down. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Roger. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: Yah Yah Yah Yah straight 
    down. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: We've been here before. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: Yah but not. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: All stop there. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: The first time I went 
    in there.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> DC: Go straight down from 
    where you are you have to go down the stairs you can't come in from the top 
    apparently. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Roger we got lost here 
    about three times so far.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: We are seeing some debris 
    now....which suggests that we are inside. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: Yah that's a pallet, 
    that palletised cargo, that's on a pallet, that's cargo that is cement yah. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: All fallen forward yes</font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> V1: Yah Yah that is cement 
    come close here. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Wandering around at the 
    bottom </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: That's a pallet. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: That's cement again lets 
    go in that direction. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: Yah these are decks, 
    let's continue the heading is nice. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">C: Seeing some more debris 
    of various descriptions. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Look like trousers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> C: Appears to be a lot of 
    cement and pallets. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V2: Were inside the car deck 
    somewhere. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">V1: ......it was loaded yah 
    yah.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It follows a conversation 
    between the diver controller (DC) and the diver (D) who tries to help the 
    ROV into the car deck from the starboard outside because the bow ramp was 
    obviously not far enough open for the ROV. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: I'm just going to put 
    your headlights off cause when you look at him he looses his camera picture. 
    Just put him in the hole. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Tell him to just drop 
    down now. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: Is that him inside? </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: No not quite. He's got 
    to go straight down. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: Straight down. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Tell him to turn to his 
    left and he'll see some guard rails, just follow the guard rails down and 
    then in ...hold on a minute all stop. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: All stop. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Right that him on the 
    ramp so if he goes to his left now.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> D: He'll have to go in down 
    the bottom now, he'll not fit in at the top.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> DC: Say again don't shout 
    I can't hear you.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> D: He'll have to go in down 
    stairs because he can't go in at the top. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">DC: He'll have to go down 
    the stairs, he can't get in at the top. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Go straight down from 
    where he is.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> DC: Does it look like he 
    is going the right way. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">D: Yea</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> D: It looks like he hasn't 
    gone in actually. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The above implies that the 
    diver knew a way from the starboard outside into the car deck which could 
    only have been the big hole in the forepart of the car deck extending down 
    into the tank spaces and probably bow thruster space of the 1st deck. See 
    also <a href="chapter36.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 36.3. </a></font></p>
