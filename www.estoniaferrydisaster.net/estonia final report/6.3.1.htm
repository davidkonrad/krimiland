  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><font size="2">The present 
    Sjöfartsverket was established in 1956 through the merger of the Pilot Administration 
    and the Sea Chart Administration. In addition, further responsibilities as 
    regards waterways were transferred to the new administration. The name Sjöfartsverket 
    was invented in 1969 and in 1988 it received a new structure. In 1975 the 
    head office was moved from Stockholm to Norrköping where about 400 of the 
    approximately 1400 employees are working headed by the general director, who 
    at the time in question, viz. January 1993 to October 1994, was Kaj Janérus. 
    The administration is part of the national defence organisation and is divided 
    into six divisions, i.e.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The country is divided 
    into thirteen sea traffic areas including the pilot stations, other installations 
    and three shipping inspection districts, to one of which the Rotterdam office 
    is attached. It is within the scope of Sjövfartsverket to supervise the performance 
    of the rules and regulations relating to safety at sea, in particular in accordance 
    with the Sea Safety Law, the subsequently issued Ship's Safety Regulation, 
    further the Law Concerning the Investigation of Sea Accidents and other internal 
    administrative regulations. Due to the international character of shipping 
    Sjövfartsverket participates in the relevant international organisations.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The Shipping 
    Inspection (Shipinspec) is one of the six divisions of Sjövfartsverket and 
    is headed by the ship's safety director. Although directly responsible to 
    the general director of Sjövfartsverket, this director has rather far-going 
    own decision powers due to a number of laws and regulations. Therefore Shipinspec 
    has a comparatively independent position compared to the other divisions, 
    in particular in matters of sea safety. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The sea safety director 
    (safety chief) is appointed by the government upon recommendation of the general 
    director of Sjövfartsverket. The head office of Shipinspec is also in Norrköping 
    where 60 of the about 120 employees work while the other 60 are distributed 
    among the three regional offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö and the 
    Rotterdam branch office. The heads of the district offices carry the title 
    "Oberinspektor" = chief inspector and are directly responsible to the safety 
    chief - safety director - who during the relevant time frame from January 
    1993 to October 1994 was Bengt-Erik Stenmark while the chief inspector positions

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Shipinspec experts 
    do the checking of all drawings relating to the design/ construction of safety 
    relevant installations, do the approval and subsequently issue the respective 
    certificates, however not in respect of hull & machinery matters. According 
    to the respective conditions of the Sea Safety Law this obligation of Shipinspec 
    was delegated to a number of approved Classification Societies, among them 
    B.V., on the basis of particular agreements. These societies have at their 
    disposal considerable technical resources and a worldwide net of inspectors 
    which otherwise Shipinspec would have to create as well. Before this background 
    of technical competence and well established control net the national maritime 
    administrations, such as Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N., have since many years 
    ago acknowledged the requirements and performance of these classification 
    societies. In order to remain up-to-date with rule and/or other changes within 
    the societies, the safety chief is for example a member of the supervisory 
    boards of B.V., DnV and ABS. On the basis of respective agreements B.V. carries 
    out on behalf of Sjövfartsverket, MARPOL, SOLAS and the Load Line inspections 
    on board of Swedish vessels which are classed by B.V. In the light of these 
    agreements and understandings both DIANA II and VIKING SALLY were built with 
    B.V. being the Classification Society and as such also responsible for the 
    approval of structural parts on behalf of Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N. This includes 
    the location of "the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck" as well as the locking devices and hinges of visor and bow ramp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(c) Inspection 
    of foreign passenger vessels regularly calling at Swedish ports</b><br>
    Based on the Sea Safety Law it is also required that passenger vessels, i.e. 
    also car/passenger ferries, who are regularly calling at Swedish ports, have 
    to be inspected as if they are Swedish vessels - see also Subchapter 6.4. 
    In other words they have to pass the so-called "1/92 inspection" before taking 
    up service and thereafter the vessel has to undergo continuous inspections 
    in intervals determined by Shipinspec. This was the situation of the ESTONIA 
    from January 1993 to 28 Septem-ber 1994.</font></p>

    Concerning the Investigation of Accidents" from 1990.<br>

    for a sea accident to be investigated if :</font></p>
  <ul>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, nearby 
    accidents also have to be investigated in the case that they were caused by 
    substantial failures of the vessel and/or safety relevant installations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The law clearly 
    defines that - apart from establishing cause and development - the gained 
    information is to be evaluated and proper measures have to be decided in order 
    to prevent a repetition of the occurrence on this or similarly constructed 
    vessels. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to §2 of 
    the "Law Concerning the Investigation of Sea Accidents" of 1990 the government 
    has decided that all accidents and nearby accidents have to be investigated 
    by the "Statens Havarie Kommission" (SHK) - the "Government's Casualty Commission". 
    During the investigation carried out by SHK a representative of Shipinspec, 
    generally the head of the Investigation Department, has to be present. Based 
    on the same law SHK has the authority to delegate the investigation of smaller 
    accidents, which have to be carried out under safety aspects only, to Shipinspec 
    who report the result among others also to IMO.</font></p>

    of accident statistics and the drawing of respective conclusions apparently 
    failed completely within Shipinspec because the internal investigator Magnus 
    Sjöberg concludes in his Report from March 1995 that there was a lack of procurement 
    and transfer of the ship safety relevant information as well as the evaluation 
    and analysis of the available material or the material which should be made 
    available and, furthermore, of a follow-up of induced measures.</font></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Magnus Sjöberg 
      was instructed on the basis of a government decree of 3rd October 1994 which 
      reads as follows: <br>
      <i>»On the 28th September 1994 on voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm the passenger 
      ferry "Estonia" sank southwest of the Finnish island Utö. The vessel sailed 
      under Estonian flag.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
      29th September 1994 the Swedish government instructed SHK to participate 
      in the casualty investigation. Thereupon a Joint Accident Investigation 
      Commission was formed from representatives of the Estonian, Finnish and 
      Swedish authorities. The main objective of the commission was to establish 
      the cause of the casualty.<br>
      Survivors of the shipping catastrophe had reported that the visor had been 
      torn open, which could be one cause of the casualty. <br>
      Subsequently obtained information revealed, that already earlier there had 
      been accidents and problems with bow doors of ferries of the same type as 
      the "Estonia". Proper safety at sea requires that conclusions are continuously 
      drawn from casualty and incidents. In addition to the investigation by the 
      Joint Accident Investigation Commission (JAIC) therefore, also the reporting 
      routines and other procedures adopted by Shipinspec should be closely examined.«
