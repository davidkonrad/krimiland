    Differences in Methodologies </b></font></p>

    When this 'Group of Experts' set out on its assigned task there was considerable 
    experience in writing and structuring of similar reports especially with Capt. 
    Hummel. But then there was the Report of the Court compiled under the direction 
    and written by the Hon. Mr. Justice Sheen on the capsizing of MV HERALD OF 
    FREE ENTERPRISE. A similar accident, brilliant in its clarity and style and 
    - so we still think - an ideal example to use. Justice Sheen in the descriptive 
    part of his Report used the "historical" method in compliance with general 
    practice in writing such reports. The facts are presented in timely order. 
    This 'Group of Experts' hence applied this method as well but adjusted it 
    as far as possible to the different methodology applied by the JAIC in the 
    compilation of their Report in order to ensure comparability of the texts 
    of both reports as best as possible. (See Subchapter 41.1.) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Report of Justice Sheen 
    sets a further example: It compiles all facts relevant to the casualty without 
    regard to source and consequences. No facts are disregarded. Facts deemed 
    relevant which however could not be clarified were clearly marked as such. 
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted this standard and attempted to adhere 
    to it to the fullest extent possible. There were however additional problems 
    in this investigation. Those who had information and knowledge pertaining 
    to the sinking of ESTONIA were often unwilling to share it with this 'Group 
    of Experts' or purposely mislead us by offering wrong information. Evidence 
    was destroyed or manipulated. This 'Group of Experts' has therefore augmented 
    the standard by the rule, that facts are only considered to be true if and 
    when they are confirmed by other information. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Last but not least Justice 
    Sheen sets a third example when he draws conclusions only that are fully supported 
    by and not in contradiction with the facts collected and found to be correct. 
    This 'Group of Experts' has accepted that standard as well and complied with 
    it.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The methodology of this 
    'Group of Experts' can be summarized in three sentences: <br>
    1. Collect and describe all facts provided they pertain to the Casualty. <br>
    2. Ensure confirmation of the facts and state which relevant facts are not 
    obtainable or not ensurable.<br>
    3. Draw conclusions only provided they match with all confirmed facts. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC - according to their 
    own statements - applied a completely different methodology. They commenced 
    their work by the establishment of a hypothetical assumption of the cause 
    of the accident. Already on the 1.10.1994 Kari Lethola informed the press, 
    the JAIC strongly believed that failure of the visor caused the casualty. 
    See Subchapter 37.2 . On the 17.10 1994 the JAIC published their 2nd Interim 
    Report containing the assumption that the visor had separated from the ship 
    as a result of failure of all three locking mechanisms. When this statement 
    was made, the accident had just happened 19 days ago, the visor had not even 
    been officially located - that happened a day later - see Chapter 24 - and 
    it took another month before it was brought to the surface for inspection 
    on 18.11.1994 - See Chapter 26 - and another two weeks before it was inspected 
    on 2.12.1994 - See Subchapter 37.2. In a press release of 16.12.1994 the JAIC 
    was already able to confirm its opinion that the strength of the locking devices 
    for the bow visor in combination with the sea loads on the visor in the prevailing 
    wave condition and headway of the ship was the main cause of the accident. 
    <br>
    For investigators to work out a theoretical assumption first and then to see 
    whether the facts fit into it, is unusual because such procedure contains 
    the danger of a biased selection or treatment of facts given the nature of 
    human beings. Such method does not merit criticism however if and as long 
    as the investigators have the will and the intellectual flexibility to abandon 
    their preconceived assumptions if not all the facts fit them.<br>
    Despite numerous discussions between the members of the two investigating 
    bodies, described in detail in Subchapters 38.1 to 38.3 and the presentation 
    of new facts by this 'Group of Experts', the JAIC on 02.04.1995 published 
    its Interim Part-Report the conclusions as to the cause of the accident had 
    not changed, which did not surprise us, but we were stunned to read that the 
    findings published in this interim report 2,5 years before the publication 
    of the Final Report will remain unchanged See Subchapter 38.3. <br>
    The fact that the JAIC did not find a path out of its own prejudice was however 
    by far not the worst malpractice exercised by them in the course of their 
    investigation. Contrary to generally accepted standards again emphasized by 
    Justice Sheen the JAIC from the very beginning of its investigation destroyed 
    evidence vital to any attempt to find the actual cause for the catastrophe. 
    An outstanding example is the bolt of the Atlantic Lock. Having established 
    and published that it was the locking devices, which had failed due to faulty 
    design; the JAIC should have made every possible effort to present the essential 
    piece of evidence to prove their allegation. If nothing else fairness and 
    decency vis-à-vis the accused builder should have commanded such action leave 
    alone the order of the three Primeministers, who had founded the JAIC, to 
    find the true causes for the disaster. Given the importance of this piece 
    of evidence the reason for dumping it into the sea and thereby into oblivion 
    can only be qualified as affront: against everybody affected by the catastrophe: 
    It seemed more important to Mr. Stenström to take the ship's bell with him 
    in the helicopter and it did not appear to him that the bolt could have been 
    sent by normal surface mail if he attributed such importance to the bell. 
    For the sordid details see Chapter 27. <br>
    But evidence was not only destroyed, it was also tampered with to an extent 
    unheard of in modern history for an investigation instituted by Westeuropean 
    governments. Again one example will suffice. Reference is made to Chapter 
    34.6 where the manipulation of the underwater video-tapes is described.<br>
    As the reader might now assume evidence was also disregarded when it did not 
    fit into the hypothetical assumptions. Again just one example out of all those 
    described in the previous Chapters of Part C of this Report: The recordings 
    made with video cameras of the wreck by divers of the Swedish Navy, when they 
    surveyed it in the first days of the month of October 1994 and those of the 
    divers, who were in the wreck during the investigation of the wreck by the 
    divers of Rockwater A/S have never been presented to the public although members 
    of the JAIC were present on the diving platform at least during the inspection 
    by the divers of Rockwater A/S. See Chapter 27 and Subchapter 34.6. </font></p>
