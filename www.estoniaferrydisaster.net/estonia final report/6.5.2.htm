  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was moored 
    alongside Baltic Shipyard and considerable inspections were carried out by

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> and by the inspectors 
    of Sjöfartsverket, Stockholm:</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> and by various representatives 
    of the E.N.M.B. as well as ESCO and N&T. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The findings of B.V. 
    are summarised in the "Survey Report for Issue (1) for Passenger Ship Safety 
    Certificate" dated 07.02.93, which is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.125.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.2.125.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report 
    mentions for example under 'General Information' on page 1:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>«Does the vessel 
      proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land, in the course of her voyage? 
      (Reg. 1 (c), Chapter II)? Yes.»</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the SOLAS edition 
    in force in January 1993, which included the SOLAS 1974 edition plus subsequent 
    addenda, no Regulation 1 (c) in Chapter II can be found anymore, i.e. the 
    B.V. form is based on an older edition of SOLAS 1974 when Reg. 1 (c) - which 
    is now Regulation 1.4. - contained the following: </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>«Chapter 
    II-1 <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Construction 
    - Subdivision and Stability,<br>
    Machinery and Electrical Installations<br>
    Part A General <br>
    Regulation 1</font></i></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>(c) The Administration 
      may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage 
      are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this 
      chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual 
      ships or classes of ships belonging to its country which, in the course 
      of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.»</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently it 
    should have been obvious for B.V. that it was not possible to grant any exemption 
    whatsoever as "the vessel proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land 
    in the course of her voyage." As the wording of Regulation 1 (c) is more or 
    less identical to Regulation 1.4. of the 1992 edition of SOLAS 1974 the application 
    of the older form did not make a difference. <br>
    The report continues with <b>item 2 - Survey of Hull and Machinery </b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2.1. Has an 
      inspection of the structure been carried out? Yes, 1-93.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This item is the 
    only one, where the B.V. form does not quote any SOLAS Regulation.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»3. Stability 
      Chapter II-1, Reg. 7 - 19-20<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Is 
      the master supplied with the necessary documents concerning stability? Yes.<br>
      (Approved by the Finnish Authorities, pending B.V. approval).« </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Here B.V. correctly 
    did not accept the "Stability Booklet" approved by the F.B.N., because there 
    were indications that it could not comply with all requirements (see Subchapter 
    6.4).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand B.V. accepted the structure of the vessel approved by F.B.N. including 
    the location of the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead, 
    although this was obviously not in accordance with the requirements of SOLAS 
    because the ramp was visibly located too much forward. It did not require 
    a detailed structural examination to find that out but just the knowledge 
    of the structure of the vessel which a Classification Society should have 
    after 12 years of attendance to a vessel built under its supervision! Knowledge 
    of the relevant SOLAS requirements Mr. Olsson and the man from Paris definitely 
    should have had, as the SOLAS rules had then already been part of the B.V. 
    rules for about 10 years. B.V. now argues in defence that the vessel in her 
    previous trade had also proceeded more than 20 nm from the nearest land - 
    which is true for the leg Vaasa-Sundsvall - and thus they could assume that 
    the structure had been approved by F.B.N. to be in conformity with SOLAS 1974 
    requirements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> SOLAS Regulation 
    12, however, requires:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»A certificate 
      called a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate shall be issued after inspection 
      and survey to a passenger ship which complies with the requirements of Chapters 
      II-1, II-2, III and IV and any other relevant requirements of the present 
      Regulation.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">and Chapter II-1, 
    Regulation 9 (ii) requires:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»If the ship 
      has a long forward superstructure, the forepeak bulkhead shall be extended 
      weathertight to the deck next above bulkhead deck. The extension need not 
      be fitted directly over the bulkhead below, provided it is at least 5 per 
      cent of the length of the ship from the forward perpendicular, and the part 
      of the bulkhead deck which forms the step is made effectively weathertight.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Nevertheless B.V. 
    issued an (Interim) PSSC confirming that the vessel did comply with SOLAS 
    in every respect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the casualty, 
    B.V. has explained this in their letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.37</a> - as follows:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    a representative from the B.V. head office Paris together with the B.V. manager 
    for Sweden, Hans Olsson, have carried out a "Periodical Survey pursuant to 
    SOLAS 1974, consolidated edition 1992, Chapter I, Part B, Regulation 7 (b) 
    (ii)", where it is stated:</font></p>

      structure .... is in satisfactory condition ... and that it complies with 
      the requirements of the present regulations, ...«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is obvious that 
    a survey in compliance with this regulation cannot have been conducted. Insofar 
    the statement of B.V. must be untrue.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is furthermore 
    questionable whether B.V. was entitled to carry out just a periodical survey, 
    because Regulation 14 - Duration and Validity of Certificates states under 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»(g) A certificate

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the co-operation 
      between B.V. and Sjöfartsverket in connection with the flag change procedure 
      was discussed with Ulf Beijner - the head of the Sjöfartsverket Inspection 
      office Stockholm at that time and in this capacity in charge of the ESTONIA 
      matter - he fully agreed to the developments and sequence-of-events explained 
      on the previous pages, but when it came to the causative connection between 
      the missing "partial collision door" and the catastrophe, he strongly rejected 
      this connection with reference to the explosion hole in the starboard side 
      in way of the 0-deck, which in his opinion was the cause of the sinking.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The findings of 
    the Sjöfartsverket inspectors - as far as available here - can be taken from 
    the handwritten remarks made on pages A - J between 04.01.93 at Turku and 
    21.01.93 in Tallinn and on 21.03.93, when the vessel was again in Turku. These 
    remarks - 9 pages - are attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.126.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.2.126</a> and indicate that at least part of the relevant safety installations 
    had not been in proper condition. It has to be assumed that the deficiencies 
    were rectified prior to Sjöfartsverket approving the vessel, although some 
    of the items either still existed or had reappeared when Åke Sjöblom and his 
    colleague inspected the vessel with their trainees shortly before the last 
    departure. See Chapter 15.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition to a 
    large number of safety checks the Sjöfartsverket inspectors also had an "Operational 
    Control" performed by the new crew of the ESTONIA which consisted of a <b>fire 
    drill</b> and an <b>abandon ship drill</b>. Details can be taken from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.2.127.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.2.127</a> - Operational Control ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 2 February 1993 
    ESTONIA finally departed from Tallinn with representatives from authorities, 
    B.V. and Sjöfartsverket on board. At sea a function test of ship and crew 
    was successfully carried out and after 2 hours the voyage to Stockholm was 
    resumed. ESTONIA looked perfect as can be seen from the following three photos.
