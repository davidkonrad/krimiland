    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The German 'Group 
      of Experts' has now - as far as possible - completed its investigation of 
      the foundering of the M. V. ESTONIA, a disaster that has taken the greatest 
      toll of human life in the Baltic Sea in times of peace. The German 'Group 
      of Experts' has during the past five years performed a difficult investigation 
      in a partly hostile and reluctant environment. The work was carried out 
      during the first two years - 1995/1996 - in close co-operation with the 
      Swedish leader of the Technical Group of the Joint Accident Investigation 
      Commission of Estonia, Finland and Sweden (JAIC), Börje Stenström († February 
      1997), and also with the Finnish member of the Technical Group, Dr. Tuomo 
      Karppinen and the expert Dr. Klaus Rahka. All the investigation results 
      of this 'Group of Experts' were submitted either verbally in joint meetings 
      with the members and the experts from Estonia, Finland and Sweden attending 
      or in letters with attached photos and/or video film documentation to the 
      JAIC. This documentation and information concerned the design, construction 
      and building of M. V. ESTONIA in general and the locking devices of the 
      bow visor in particular, including the load calculations, the co-operation 
      with the Classification Society Bureau Veritas, and the Owners. Furthermore, 
      detailed evaluations of all survivors' statements, statements and other 
      documentation such as photos and videos showing the condition of safety 
      relevant parts of the ferry before the casualty obtained from previous passengers 
      and crew members were submitted. In response, the JAIC submitted information 
      and documentation, and up until the end of 1996 a relatively intense exchange 
      of views and technical discussions took place which died away with Börje 
      Stenström. A very detailed evaluation of the condition of the visor performed 
      by metallurgical experts, of the objects recovered from the wreck or cut 
      off from the visor, of the video films from the wreck made by ROVs and divers, 
      of the testimony of shipyard employees having participated in the design, 
      construction and building of VIKING SALLY, of previous passengers and crew 
      members of the ferry as well as of survivors of the disaster form the backbone 
      of this Investigation Report and are the basis for its conclusions. Breaking 
      tests with mock-ups of the Atlantic lock were carried out by the Institute 
      for Shipbuilding of the Hamburg University in co-operation with a member 
      and an expert from the Finnish part of the JAIC. During the first half of 
      1997 it became evident that the JAIC would not change its first technical 
      findings and conclusions published in the so-called Part-Report in April 
      1995 in spite of all the evidence submitted by this 'Group of Experts' and 
      others which indicate a totally different chain of causation and sequence 
      of events. Therefore it was decided to demonstrate the own investigation 
      results to the Swedish public in two Exhibitions in the heart of the City 
      of Stockholm, because it was Sweden who had paid the highest death toll 
      in the disaster and consequently the Swedish public followed our investigations 
      very closely. As from the Exhibitions - especially after the second - considerable 
      support was received from Swedish citizens and further contact was made 
      with a number of very important witnesses of fact. This Investigation Report 
      covers all the evidence available to this 'Group of Experts' until 27.11.1999. 
      Whenever considered relevant the attention of the reader will be drawn to 
      the findings of the JAIC in comparison to the findings of this 'Group of 
      Experts'. During the course of the investigation and, in particular, during 
      the two exhibitions in Stockholm, many meetings with survivors and relatives 
      of the casualty victims took place, which left deep impressions. Many of 
      the relatives and survivors pleaded to assist them in the finding of the 
      truth. This authors of this Report have attempted to comply with this plea.</font></p>

      this investigation reveals that,</b></i></font></p>

      the JAIC misleads its readers, whether purposely or due to the incompetence 
      of its authors, is left to the decision of the readers of this report. </font></p>
