  Other Observations</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">This subchapter 
    contains observations of survivors after they had reached the open deck 7 
    and/or were on the outside hull and/or in the water/liferaft/lifeboat which 
    might be of relevance for the casualty scenario and/or the causes for the 
    sinking.</font></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He walked down 
      the side below the bridge and diagonally further towards the fenderbar. 
      Then he saw the other ferries far away. The port side was the lee side.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- When he was at 
    the forward part of the fenderbar he saw something like a fin sticking out 
    of the hull, dark like the bottom, maybe 1.5 m or less, looking like a propeller 
    blade of a plane. It was not moving.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He tried to reach 
    it but was washed into the sea by a wave. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> The 
    photo which Mikael Öun made of the Estonian boy sitting on the vessel's bilge 
    strake probably shows this sticking out part. </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> PT: There were 
      maybe up to 100 persons at the most who were on the ship's outside, of which 
      about 50 or half of them crawled up to the keel or the bottom and later 
      more forward as she began to go down aft. And I knew that gradually she 
      would sink. And now the stern went down first. And she raised up forward, 
      and therefore I did not want to climb up more, and I tried to stop others, 
      or to calm down others who were blindly rushing towards the highest spot 
      where a crowd of about 50 people had gathered, exactly above a fin stabilizer 
      which stood and worked to and fro for the whole time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> OF: There was 
      a fin stabilizer out?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> PT: Yes, oh yes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> OF: You could 
      see this also?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> PT: Yes, I could 
      see it on the port side. It stood and went to and fro like this all the 
      time, very fast. About 50 percent of the people had gathered up there. And 
      she began to go down aft, and I had come (down) to about half of the depth 
      (of the ship).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
    Pierre Thiger was shown the general arrangement plan, he indicated his way 
    down the port side approximately below the port bridge wing and emphasized 
    that what he thought to have been the stabilizer had been to his right, i.e. 
    to forward. After he had seen on the drawing that the stabilizer was fitted 
    about midships above the bilge strake, i.e. to his left he was certain that 
    it could not have been the stabilizer he had seen to his right far forward 
    but something else which was moving and which, according to his statement, 
    had been vertically bigger than horizontally.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He crawled down 
      the port side below the bridge and saw a big object to his right, i.e. towards 
      forward, which was big and moving in/out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He thought that 
      it was the stabilizer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He managed to 
      get into a raft.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The vessel turned 
      more than 90° and the bridge, deck 8, deck 7, etc. disappeared while his 
      raft was still alongside the hull where the bridge had been before.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
    Tony Spuhl was shown the actual location of the stabilizer on the general 
    arrangement plan, he admitted that it must have been some thing else what 
    he saw forward at the bow, probably the visor then still connected to the 
    vessel.</font></p>

    The Sinking </font> </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 01.30/32 hours 
    the ferry was on her side according to the statements of many survivors, e.g. 
    Lars-Olof Lamke who was then washed from board where-by the glass of his wristwatch 
    was broken and his watch stopped at that time, and Einar Kukk, who looked 
    at his watch before going into the water.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel 
    was then only slightly trimmed to the stern. The funnel smashed several times 
    onto the waves and then disappeared while the vessel turned further to starboard 
    and the stern sank deep down. Finally the vessel was completely upside down 
    with the stern area resting aground already and the bow rising high, the highest 
    point being the bulbous bow. The drifting stopped and the bow was turned, 
    towards East by the westerly storm, while it sank stepwise deeper in the waves.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was in this 
    position that several crew members and passengers being in liferafts in the 
    area of the foreship noted that the visor was no more in place, but that the 
    bow ramp was visible in closed or almost closed condition. The bow sank slowly 
    down and the last visible part of the vessel was the bulbous bow looking like 
    a whale with the waves washing over it.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 01.53 hours 
    the echo of ESTONIA disappeared from the radar screens of the MARIELLA. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The biggest shipping 
    catastrophe in peace time in Europe had become a fact. </font></p>
