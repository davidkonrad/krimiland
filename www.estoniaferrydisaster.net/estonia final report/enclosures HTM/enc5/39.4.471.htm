  <p><font size="2">Dear Börje,</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> Several months have passed since our last contact in writing 
    and although we have recently spoken a few times on the phone, we would like 
    to put down on paper a number of items which we consider to be of relevance 
    before your respective investigations are finalised and the Final Report is 
    completed.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <b>I.</b> Our letter dated 22.01.96 in reply to your letter 
    of 21.12.95 has not been commented on by you at all. Consequently, we do assume 
    that all the items raised in your letter have been answered respectively commented 
    by us to your satisfaction, as has been confirmed by you recently during one 
    of our telephone conversations. Nevertheless, we shall revert to some of the 
    items further down as new information/evidence has been obtained in the meantime.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <b>II.</b> We have read the interview which Olof Forsberg 
    gave the magazine "Stern" some weeks ago with interest, in particular his 
    remarks concerning the quality of our work found our attention. In order to 
    clarify our position with regard to the so-called FELIX Report please accept 
    the following explanations: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">1. We had received a translation of 5 pages (out of 85) 
      of the FELIX Report from Spiegel TV with the request to find out whether 
      the results of our investigation would confirm or disprove the allegation 
      of the FELIX Report "that crew members had attempted to open the visor at 
      sea". Before doing so we have cross-checked certain other allegations made 
      in this Report in Tallinn and found them to be basically confirmed.<br>
      </font><font size="2">2. When reviewing our information/documentation it 
      became obvious to us that certain observations of survivors - all of which 
      were told to the criminal police during the interrogations on the first 
      days after the casualty - but also particular circumstances which, so far, 
      remained unexplained, could make sense if indeed crew members had tried 
      to open the visor some time before the casualty sequence.<br>
      3. We conveyed our findings to Spiegel TV and "Der Spiegel" where they were 
      published in distorted form. <br>
      4. In anticipation of the reaction of the media following the publication 
      of Spiegel TV/Spiegel Magazine on 14th/15th April, we had prepared a press 
      release (enclosure no. 1) which, we believe, makes our position quite clear, 
      i.e. we have never said or written that we believe the allegations of the 
      FELIX Report in connection with "Estonia" to be true, but that <i>assuming</i> 
      that they should be true the stated observations of survivors and particular 
      circumstances - as lined out in our press release - could make sense. So 
      much for the FELIX Report. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2"><b>III. Evidence from the Wreck <br>
    </b></font><font size="2">We were most surprised to learn from the Swedish 
    media that your Commission has stated it needed no more evidence from the 
    wreck. During our last meeting in Stockholm you had told us that you would 
    make sure that the interesting items would be brought up respectively taken 
    on video film before the covering commences. How is this discrepancy to be 
    understood? Why are you no longer interested in bringing light into certain 
    matters which do need clarification, if for no other reason than to avoid 
    the creation of legends? We have been requested from various sides during 
    the last weeks to state what we consider necessary to be brought up respectively 
    to be examined/filmed on site and have summarised this in a letter, which 
    is attached as enclosure no. 2. The letter was initially written upon request 
    of Henning Witte, the lawyer representing the DIS-Group of Relatives (Bendreus) 
    in their efforts to persuade the Swedish Government to postpone the covering 
    until at least your final report has been published. The letter was subsequently 
    also sent to Swedish TV stations, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter (Anders 
    Hellberg). It has recently been amended by the necessity to have the condition 
    of the watertight doors examined, which certainly had influenced the sinking 
    speed! We have read your interview in Dagens Nyheter in this respect and might 
    remark that the control light arrangement for the WT doors on the bridge must 
    have been changed after the vessel was renamed "Estonia", because as long 
    as she was sailing under Finnish flag the lights were "green" when the doors 
    were "open" (which was the normal situation) and "red" when the doors were 
    "closed". To sum it up, in our opinion, it is mandatory to have the accessible 
    objects brought up and to examine the other items on site respectively tape 
    them on video. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>IV. The book "Katastrofen Kurs" by Anders Jörle and Anders 
    Hellberg </b><br>
    We have read this book with great interest. We gather therefrom that it is 
    now public and undisputed knowledge in Sweden that the ramp was untight and 
    that the technical managers and part owners of the vessel knew this positively. 
    After they had allowed the visor to become untight they also allowed the vessel 
    to sail with the only forward closure of the cardeck being untight as well. 
    As will be shown later this is the root of the catastrophe. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>V.</b> Finally, we would like to bring to your attention 
    further investigation results in addition to those reported to you already 
    in our previous letters. These are: </font></p>

      1.1. Hinge plates Examination of the remains of the visor hinge plates at 
      KTH, Stockholm revealed a/o that - the starboard hinge plates have deep 
      burning marks from which numerous cracks (fatigue) had started and penetrated 
      the material to varying extent. - the port hinge plates have a smooth surface 
      with slight indications of burning marks in some restricted areas only. 
      - measurements of the closest distances between the vertical plates to which 
      the hinge plates are welded and the hinge plates revealed that this distance 
      is 10-12 mm smaller at Starboard side compared to port side. This leads 
      to the conclusion that the burning action has destroyed 10-12 mm of the 
      hinge plate material of the Starboard hinges which, however, remained at 
      the port side hinge plates. Consequently the visor was misaligned by the 
      distance of 10-12 mm. Evidence: Report of Prof. Hoffmeister, Photos. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">1.2. Stempost The stempost was originally the strongest 
      part of the visor - 200 mm wide and 60 mm thick - and formed the forward 
      lower support, taking the major part of the design load of 55 ts, thereby 
      resting on the upper extension of the ice-stem being the forward part of 
      A-Deck, thus there was steel to steel contact. According to the initial 
      design the stempost was supposed to carry at least 80% of the weight, whilst 
      the 2 compression bars fitted on A-Deck and the (intact) rubber packings 
      took the remaining weight. Due to this distribution the bottom of the visor 
      was pressed into the rubber packings some 8-10 mm - as long as they were 
      in place - thereby assuring watertightness. Between the top of pyramid on 
      A-Deck and the pocket into which it fitted there was a design play of 50 
      mm, to the side just of 3 mm. As long as the visor had its original shape 
      and geometry there was not steel to steel contact between the inside of 
      pocket/pyramid nor between bottom of visor/A-Deck. Upon investigation in 
      Hangö it was noted that the stempost was broken practically in 4 parts the 
      lowest of which had disappeared well before the casualty, leaving a gap 
      in the bottom of the visor. Due to the missing part of the stempost as well 
      as the cracks sustained therein the stempost could no longer carry the main 
      weight of the visor which was now taken up by the pyramid/pocket and the 
      forepart of the visor bottom, which in turn led to cracks in the welding 
      seams already some time before the casualty. Furthermore, the changed weight 
      distribution caused additional stress on hinges and locking devices and 
      added to the misalignment of the visor as a whole.<i><b> <br>
      Evidence:</b></i> Report Prof. Hoffmeister, Photos. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">1.3. Missing rubber packings It is evident from the underwater 
      videos and demonstrated by several photos that the rubber packings on A-Deck 
      were either missing or damaged with very few exceptions, whilst the flat 
      bar and holding bolts, between which the rubber packings were fitted, are 
      obviously undamaged and in place. The same refers to the holding bolts fitted 
      by the crew when the vessel was still "Viking Sally". Consequently, there 
      was nothing to prevent seawater from entering the visor inside once the 
      outboard level was rising above A-Deck. The rubber packings were not just 
      gone on the A-Deck but also in the most crucial areas in front of the 2 
      bulkheads at both sides of the ramp opening, i.e. of the vessel, where they 
      are missing about 2 m upwards of the bulkheads. This is exactly the area 
      where they are most required, i.e. on A-Deck in front and about 1 m up the 
      bulkheads, because intact rubber packings, in particular in the above-mentioned 
      locations, not only seal the visor inside against water ingress but are 
      also a relevant part of the visor's closing system, because only the counter 
      pressure of intact rubber packings against the closed locking devices assures 
      a firm connection between visor/vessel and prevents vibration of the visor 
      at sea. The lack of rubber packings in most relevant areas did not permit 
      this firm connection between visor and vessel and the visor therefore vibrated 
      within the existing play, which created the 'banging noises' heard by many 
      passengers not only on the casualty voyage but also before. Needless to 
      say that these movements of the visor created undue further stress on the 
      locking and holding devices. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">1.4. Old Damages There are 2 severe damages having existed 
      before the casualty, viz. - in front of the visor between bottom and up 
      the 2nd stringer level, and - in way of the 3rd stringer port side, which 
      is bent upwards with bent and buckled frames/brackets. These damages have 
      doubtlessly affected the geometry of the visor and led - in addition to 
      all the other explained circumstances - to additional misalignment. Details 
      have been explained in previous letters. <i><b><br>
      Evidence</b></i>: Report Prof. Hoffmeister, Photos. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>2. Locking Devices</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> 2.1. Atlantic Lock Examination of the remains of the 3 
      lugs fixed to A-Deck, now at KTH, Stockholm, revealed that u to 90% of the 
      welds between lugs/bushings were <i>fatigue</i> cracked and the load carrying 
      capacity reduced respectively. The starboard lug with the support bracket 
      is not original, the welds between lug/bushing, bracket/bushing are repair 
      welds made when the starboard lug/bracket was fitted to A-Deck.<i><b><br>
      Evidence</b></i>: Report Prof. Hoffmeister, Statements of Yard welders, 
      Photos. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To test the load carrying capacity of the Atlantic Lock 
      a mok-up was built by Meyer Werft with original dimensions, except for the 
      welding seams between lugs/bushings which were dimensioned just 3 mm - as 
      found at the lugs recovered from the vessel (original 7-8 mm) - upon request 
      of Klaus Rahka/VTT. The breaking test performed by the Institut für Schiffbau 
      of the University, Hamburg - Professor Petershagen - in the presence of 
      Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka/VTT-Helsinki revealed that the visor lug 
      broke at a load of 210 ts. Subsequent examination by Prof. Hoffmeister revealed 
      that the bolt (ST 52 steel) was slightly bent, that Starboard and centre 
      lugs were slightly bent apart but the welding seams - although just 3 mm 
      - showed no cracks at all. <i><b><br>

      Hamburg, Report Prof. Hoffmeister </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>2.2. Hydraulic Sidelocks</b><br>
      We have nothing new to report, but would like to have the parts available 
      at KTH to be examined by Prof. Hoffmeister for fatique cracks. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>2.3. Manual Sidelocks </b><br>
      These additional securings - called "heavy weather securings" by Bureau 
      Veritas - were not - as we all know - engaged. We are aware of the statement 
      of Ulf Hobro at our first joint meeting on 16.2.95, namely that these locks 
      were only engaged when other parts, e.g. the hydraulic cylinders, would 
      be repaired in port. Therefore it might be helpful to draw your attention 
      to the statement of the 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür taken on 3.10.94 by the 
      Tallinn police, in which he testifies that he was the responsible engineer 
      for watertight doors and the hydraulic arrangements of the visor. He further 
      stated that the visor has 5 fixing points and that there were 2 manual bolts 
      which the boatswain has to engage. Evidently Peeter Tüür knew that these 
      bolts had to be engaged, thus it follows logic to assume that at least the 
      nautical offiers and the boatswain - if not the technical inspector - knew 
      it. <br>
      <i><b>Evidence:</b></i> Statement of Peeter Tüür taken on 3.10.94 by Tallinn 
      Police, Report about Joint Meeting International Commission/ German Group 
      of Experts - 15/16.02.95 </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>3. Hinges at Stockholm </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(a) Examination of the recovered steel bushing with part 
      of the visor hinge plate still attached to it revealed a/o that - the gap 
      between bushing and hinge plate is some cm wide; - the material accumulated 
      at one side and extending into the gap is apparently welding material; - 
      in the remains of the welding seams between bushing/visor hinge plate small 
      burning marks can be seen. This leads to the conclusion that the gap must 
      have existed prior to the casualty as otherwise the material could not have 
      gotten into it. <br>
      (b) A video film made a couple of days before the casualty by a passenger 
      shows the Starboard hinge in detail. It is obvious that - there is a wide 
      gap between the outer hinge plates of vessel/visor in a location where normally 
      the inner part of the steel bushing and the distance ring should be; - the 
      outer securing plate is missing, although 3 bolts can be seen sticking out 
      of the bushing; - the outer part of the bushing appears to be disproportionately 
      large; - the lower part of the bushing at the outer side appears to be missing 
      completely. <i><b>Note</b></i>: The relevant part of the video film will 
      be analysed by a professional analyst and the result will be submitted to 
      you in due course. <br>
      (d) Examination of the remains of the 4 visor hinge plates at KTH, Stockholm 
      revealed a/o that - the 2 Starboard and the inner port hinge plates are 
      straight; - the lower part of the port outer hinge plate is bent to port 
      . According to Prof. Hoffmeister this leads to the conclusion that the port 
      outer hinge broke last when the visor was in a position to the port side 
      of the centre line of the vessel. <br>

    <p><font size="2"><b>4. Visor lugs of Hydraulic Lifting Cylinders (Actuators)</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> After the failure of the hinges the visor moved forward 
      and the lugs underneath the visor arms were cutting through the 8 mm deck 
      plating, but only for 120 mm, then they hit the rather strong transverse 
      deck-beam. According to the estimate of metallurgists it took any time up 
      to 10 minutes for the lugs to cut through this strong beam. The condition 
      can best be demonstrated by the photo below showing the void space on B-Deck 
      Starboard side with closed visor. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><b><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/a.jpg" width="544" height="327"></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">B-Deck starboard side pre-casualty condition 
      When the lugs were working their way through deck and deck beam whilst the 
      visor was moving forward/aft naturally deep scorings were sustained by the 
      lugs. Assuming that the vessel was still in an upright condition - which 
      is part of your scenario - these scoring marks would be more or less of 
      similar intensity at the outer as well as at the inner lug plates. This, 
      however, is not the case as can be clearly seen by the photos below. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/b.jpg" width="497" height="355"></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2">The <i><b>port inner sid</b></i>e, however, 
      which is shown on the above picture, evidently sustained very deep and sharp 
      scorings indicating severe pressure from port to starboard and straight 
      as drawn by a ruler. The following picture shows the <i><b>inner side of 
      the starboard lug</b></i> - practically the counter-part to the port outer 
      side - with some deep scorings at the upper part indicating more of a circular 
      movement.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="5"><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/d.jpg" width="548" height="366"></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The picture below finally shows the outer side 
      of the starboard lug - practically the counterpart of the severely scored 
      inner side of the port lug - indicating also severe pressure from port to 
      starboard side, though apparently not as heavy as at the port lug inner 
      side. The cut area through the green painted forecastle deck is clearly 
      visible and straight as if drawn with a ruler.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/e.jpg" width="510" height="291"></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The above pictures lead to the following conclusions:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> - The scorings at the lugs can only have been 
      caused when the lugs were cutting through deck/deck beams.<br>
      - Contact between lugs and deck/deck beams is only possible after the hinges 
      have failed.<br>
      - The much deeper scorings at the port inner side respectively starboard 
      outer side compared to the port outer side and the starboard inner side 
      indicate severe pressure from port to starboard. <br>
      - This leads to the conclusion that the vessel listed already to starboard 
      when the hinges broke and the lugs commenced their cutting work.<br>
      - Since it took some 10 mintues for the lugs to cut through the deck beam 
      and thereafter another 360 mm of deck plating had to be cut before the aft 
      side of the ramp-house could have come into contact with the ramp, however, 
      there are only very minor scratches at the outer side of the port lug plate, 
      it has to be concluded that the vessel must have already had a considerable 
      starboard list while this cutting work was in progress.<br>
      - Furthermore, bearing in mind that there had obviously only been sufficient 
      contact between these frames (at port side of the inner ramp house in way 
      of the first 4 frames) and the port side of the ramp to overcome the ca. 
      40 ts holding power of the port ramp hook, the question arises what force 
      opened the starboard ramp hook (if it had ever been closed), because the 
      minor indentation and mainly only light scorings decreasing from port to 
      starboard at the inside of the ramp house do demonstrate </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">a.) that there was only very minor contact between the 
        larger part of the upper ramp and the ramp-house between the 5th frame 
        counting from port side and then decreasing to the starboard side, and<br>
        b.) that the visor at the time of contact, i.e. when the port frames were 
        bent and the starboard ones only scored, must have been in a condition 
        shifted to port as it had already been when the last hinge plate, i.e. 
        the port outer hinge plate, broke. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- In other words, it can be concluded that when the ramp-house 
      finally came into contact with the upper part of the ramp the vessel had 
      had a very substantial starboard list for some time already and the visor 
      had been in a condition shifted to port of vessel's centre line.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>5. Inner Bulkheads </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The same as can be observed from the lugs underneath the 
      visor arms is confirmed by the damage/scorings to the port inner bulkhead, 
      whilst the opposite starboard side is completely untouched with absolutely 
      no contact marks. The 2 pictures below show the inner side of the visor 
      bulkhead with deep scorings/indentation and the holes partly torn. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><b><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/f.jpg" width="471" height="306"></b></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><b><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/g.jpg" width="475" height="311"><br>
      </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The ramp is at that stage already partly pushed open whilst 
      the visor is resting in way of the obvious contact area on the ramp. The 
      partly open ramp is thus preventing the visor from falling off to starboard. 
      The sketch below shows the approximate situation at this particular moment. 
      The foundation of the port actuator is still inside of the vessel's front 
      bulkhead, although already broken loose from B-Deck. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>6. Conclusion </b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">1-5 In summary of item A.1-5 the following 
      further conclusions can be drawn:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> - The visor was also misaligned due to improper 
      burning at the starboard hinge plates.<br>
      - The stempost was severely damaged and had lost its main weight carrying 
      function nearly totally. This led to additional misalignment of the visor 
      in combination with additional stress on hinges/locking devices. The gap 
      in the stempost area in connection with cracked welding seams has led to 
      flooding of the visor inside up to outboard level.<br>
      - The missing rubber packings had, in addition to the a/m gap in the stempost 
      and cracked open welding seams, also resulted in a rapid flooding of the 
      visor inside due to the so-called pumping effect.<br>
      - The firm connection between visor/hull of vessel normally established 
      by the combination rubber packings/visor weight/tension of locking devices 
      was lost due to the missing rubber packings in relevant locations which 
      led to movements of the visor at sea within the existing play and additional 
      stress on hinges/locking devices. The movements of the visor created the 
      low banging noises heard by passengers on previous voyages as well as on 
      the casualty voyage.<br>
      - At least the 2 most severe old damages in the visor had led to additional 
      deformation and misalignment.<br>
      - The Atlantic Lock arrangement at vessel's side was weakened due to improper 
      repair and fatique cracks in the welds between lugs/ bushings of up to 90% 
      of its initial load carrying capacity.<br>
      - The 1st breaking test performed by the "Institut für Schiffbau", Hamburg 
      revealed that the visor lug broke at 210 ts load whilst deformations of 
      the bolt and the starboard and centre lugs were minor. The welds, however, 
      showed no cracks at all, although just 3 mm strong. This leads to the following 
      conclusions: </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">(a) The arrangement failed at 210 ts which 
      is more than double the design load of 100 ts. <br>
      (b) The arrangement at vessel's side with even weaker welds than having 
      existed at the initially installed Atlantic Lock - withstood 210 ts, i.e. 
      is able to carry more than 210 ts. <br>
      (c) According to the damage picture found on "Estonia" the lugs at vessel's 
      side broke, whilst the visor lug withstood, although stretched and bent. 
      This leads to the conclusion that the Atlantic Lock arrangement at vessel's 
      side must have been substantially weakened - as found by Prof. Hoffmeister 
      - and thus failed at some load below 210 ts. <br>
      (d) The Atlantic Lock arrangement which was installed on "Estonia" at the 
      time of its failure can in no way be compared with what had been installed 
      by Meyer Werft on the newbuilding "Viking Sally". Its load carrying capacity 
      was substantially reduced.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2"> <i><b>Note:</b></i> Three further breaking tests were 
        performed by the "Institut für Schiffbau", viz. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">(a) bushings/lugs at vessel's side without any welding connection 
      at all = <i><b>result : 100 ts; </b></i><br>
      (b) bushings/lugs at vessel's side connected with spot welds only (in order 
      to simulate as closely as possible the condition existing at time of casualty) 
      =<i><b> result : 142 ts;</b></i><br>
      (c) bushing/lugs at vessel's side with 3 mm welds connected as found at 
      the lugs having been installed at the time of casualty/visor lug over-dimensioned 
      to make sure that the lugs at vessel's side break, bolt ST90 (as has been 
      at the previous tests already = <i><b>result : 220 ts.</b></i> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As the breaking occurred with no <i><b>welds at all at 100 
      ts</b></i> and with<i><b> 3 mm welds at 220 ts</b></i> it can be concluded 
      that <i><b>1 mm welding seams corresponds to a load carrying capacity of 
      40 ts</b></i>, i.e. the initially installed lugs/bushing with 7-8 mm welds 
      had an LCC of 7 x 40 ts = 280 ts + 100 ts = <i><b>380 ts</b></i>. Based 
      on the test results of VTT, Helsinki the break-load of the starboard side 
      lock was found to be <i><b>178 ts</b></i>, whilst the port one was found 
      to be only<i><b> 131 ts. </b></i>In addition, the <i><b>2 manual sidelocks</b></i> 
      would have produced about <i><b>50 ts each</b></i>, i.e. 100 ts. In summary 
      it has to be concluded that at the time the vessel was delivered to her 
      owners there was an LCC of in total<i><b> 789 ts~800 ts</b></i> available 
      which fulfilled all requirements having then been in force.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="2">- The manual side locks were not engaged, although they 
      should have been according to 2nd Engineer Peeter Tüür and Bureau Veritas. 
      <br>
      - The starboard visor hinges were substantially predamaged. This is not 
      only demonstrated by the remaining parts available at KTH, Stockholm, but 
      also by the video film made by a Swedish passenger a couple of days before 
      the catastrophe.<br>
      - The different damage pictures of the lug plates underneath the visor arms, 
      i.e. the scratches/scorings at the inner and outer sides can only have been 
      developed when those lug plates were cutting through deck-plating/deck-beams. 
      Such cutting was only possible when the hinges were broken and the visor 
      moved forward. The port outerside plate just shows some minor scratches 
      whilst the port innerside plate is very deeply scored, indicating load from 
      port to starboard. A similar picture is shown on the starboard lug plates 
      where the outerside is much more deeply scored than the inner side. This 
      is clear evidence that the visor's weight was lasting from port to starboard 
      and this cannot be explained with the waves coming from port, because when 
      the hinges broke wind/sea were already coming from straight ahead (statement 
      V.Kikuts), whilst the vessel was turning further to port (statements Hillerström 
      and Jonsson). The deep indentations/scorings at the port inner longitudinal 
      bulkhead of the visor which were created when the visor was resting on the 
      ramp, support this assumption as at the opposite side - the starboard inner 
      longitudinal bulkhead - there is not even a scratch. There are more marks/indentations/ 
      scorings and scratches pointing in the same direction, but the a/m should 
      be enough for now. From the above it has to be concluded that the hinges 
      broke when the vessel already had a considerable starboard list which triggered 
      off the catastrophe sequence-of-events and must have been caused by something 
      other than the bow ramp being pulled open by the visor. As will be explained 
      in the following water entered the cardeck not only from the full visor 
      through the damaged bow ramp, but also through the ventilation openings 
      and subsequently through the scuppers with non-functioning non-return valves. 
      <br>
      - At the time of the hinges breaking and contact between ramp/ramp-house 
      the visor was in a condition shifted to port of vessel's centre line. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>B. Bow Ramp </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We would like to to begin this section with some statements 
      made by crew members to journalists on the day of their survival, the 28th 
      September, 1994, after they had just been brought to safety: </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(a) On 28.9.94 at 12h33 the following was published: "The 
      2nd engineer of the ship has been rescued and in an interview he said that 
      the front "car gate" was defective and had let in water." <br>
      (b) On 28.9.94 at 15h57 the following was published: "According to an Estonian 
      machine operator, Henrik Sillaste, who managed to escape from the ship through 
      a funnel, the gate of the cardeck was for some reason slightly open and 
      water came to the deck through it. The body of water, weighing many tons, 
      that got inside the ferry made it very unstable, and the wind and the size 
      of the waves (according to the reports as high as 10 metres) were enough 
      to push the ship to its side." <br>
      (c) On 29.9.94 Reuter published the following: "The cause of the accident 
      has not been determined. Henrik Sillaste, a surviving member of the crew, 
      said he saw water pouring in through the bow gate shortly before the vessel 
      capsized off the Finnish coast Wednesday morning. When the water was knee-high 
      on the cardeck the engines stopped. The boat listed to its side and sank. 
      Sillaste said he thought it was rain and wave water entering the ship because 
      one of the two bow gates was not properly locked." </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As the above statements were made only a few hours after 
      the crew members had survived the catastrophe and were still under the impression 
      of what they had gone through during that night, and as they were made totally 
      without the later influence from shore people, these statements have to 
      be considered true, no matter what the respective person might have stated 
      subsequently. As a matter of fact, there is more evidence in respect of 
      "the front gate was defective and had let in water" and "the gate of the 
      cardeck was for some reason left slightly open and water came to the deck 
      through it", because 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür stated on 3rd October 1994 
      to the Tallinn Police among other things, "... behind the visor there is 
      the ramp. It shall also be hermetically tight! You find just a few spots 
      where the ramp is not hermetically tight." Meant is certainly the gap or 
      gaps created by the twisted port outer hinge with broken bearing which had 
      been put by the crew repeatedly (your words) on repair lists, however, repairs 
      of which were obviously deferred by the management possibly until the next 
      scheduled time in shipyard. In the book "Katastrofen Kurs" Anders Hellberg 
      and Anders Jörle mention in this respect on page 76, top a/o: ".. But let 
      us first turn to the damage to the ramp which according to N&T was taken 
      up in the list of repairs to be carried out. Already here a fact is found 
      which no normal classification society should accept: There was practically 
      a damage to which in practice was the collision bulkhead of the vessel, 
      but which was just put on the list for repairs to be carried out." As stated 
      above this is obviously undisputed public knowledge in Sweden! </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>7. Deformation / Misalignment / Non-Watertightness</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> <i><b>7.1</b></i>. Port outer hinge/bearing It has to be 
      assumed that this hinge became twisted when the vessel had a list to starboard 
      in excess of 2°, which was not adjusted before the loading or discharging 
      of trucks commenced and the damage occurred when one or more heavy trucks 
      drove over the ramp. This seems to be a risk well known to ferry operators. 
      The hinge became twisted and the bearing broke, which was most probably 
      only noted by the crew when the ramp could not be closed before departure 
      because the port side had sunk down somewhat. To rectify this some piece 
      of steel was hammered underneath the bearing to keep the ramp closest possible 
      to its upper normal position. Obviously it was thereafter possible to open/close 
      the ramp, however, some gaps remained, i.e. the bow ramp = upper extension 
      of collision bulkhead above freeboard deck = was not watertight anymore, 
      or to use the words of 2nd Engineer Peeter Tüür: "no more hermetically tight", 
      because it was deformed and misaligned. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The temporary repairs can best be seen from the photo below 
      made from one of the underwater video films. The steel piece underneath 
      the bearing can be clearly seen. The ramp was kept in approximately normal 
      position as far as up/down is concerned, however the forward deformation 
      could not be corrected by that. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="6"><img src="../../all%20enclosures/enclosures39/39.4.417/j.jpg" width="290" height="396"></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>7.2. Locking bolt </b><br>
      In addition to the 2 hooks at the upper part of the ramp, there are at each 
      side 2 hydraulically operated and conically shaped locking bolts which moved 
      from vessel's side into pockets at the ramp side, thereby increasing the 
      pressure of the ramp on the rubber packings. The 2 starboard bolts and the 
      upper port bolts apparently still had been able to move into their mating 
      pockets, because these pockets were found to be torn open after the casualty. 
      The port lower bolt, however, could not move into its pocket due to the 
      deformation of the ramp in forward direction.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> <b>7.3. Leakages / Gaps </b><br>
      As a result of the above there were substantial leakages around the ramp 
      to the large cardeck.<br>
      - at the port lower corner about 1,5 m upwards and about 1,5 m athwartships; 
      <br>
      - at some locations at the opposite starboard side of the ramp. As at sea 
      there was always water inside the visor up to the outboard level - the picture 
      below shows the normal height - something had to be done to avoid major 
      water ingress on the cardeck. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">As the owners/technical managers were obviously 
      not prepared to take the vessel out of service for the required time to 
      permanently repair this damage and on the other hand major water ingress 
      to the cardeck had to be avoided by all means, the crew sealed the existing 
      leakages both from visor side - see picture below - but also from cardeck 
      side. This was frequently observed by truck drivers and other passengers. 
      </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Note:</i></b> According to a previous crew member 
        it was known to those responsible since March 1994 that there were substantial 
        leakages in the bow ramp and that there was always some water on the cardeck. 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Needless to say that such method to secure watertightness 
      of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead of a passenger vessel is 
      unacceptable and totally useless against a water column of about 6 m in 
      the visor </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>7.4. Conclusion </b><br>
      In summary of this Section B it has to be concluded that <br>
      - the bow ramp - being part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
      - was damaged to such an extent that there were substantial gaps/leakages 
      between the inside of the visor and the cardeck; <br>
      - the port lower securing bolt could not engange its mating pocket at the 
      rampside incl. the sensor for the indicator lights (in consequence neither 
      on the bridge nor on the cardeck panel could be "green" indicating ramp 
      closed and secured).<br>
      - the cardeck was open to the water quantities inside the visor which would 
      have been disastrous for the stability of the vessel already long before 
      the catastrophe. To avoid this the crew plugged the leakages from visor 
      as well as from cardeck side, which might have been partly successful during 
      normal trading, but was ineffective against the pressure built up in the 
      visor on the night of 27/28.9.94. </font></p>

      C. Cardeck / 1st Deck</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2"> 8. Penetration of Water </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">8.1. Scuppers </font></b><font size="2"><br>
      We assume that there had always been some water on the cardeck since March 
      1994, the quantities of which certainly depended on the height of the water 
      level inside the visor, which, in turn, depended on the sea condition. In 
      other words, the worse the weather and seastate were, the higher the water 
      level was inside the visor (and the more violent was the water movement 
      inside the visor) and the heavier was the water pressure on the "seals" 
      in the leakages, the more water penetrated these "seals" onto the cardeck. 
      All this was well known to a number of crew members and the technical managers. 
      In order to cope with the water on cardeck which, due to the more or less 
      permanent stern trim, quickly ran to the aft part, some or all scuppers 
      were constantly open. We assume that the remark made by Äke Sjöblom to a 
      journalist when he was interviewed on the 28th September, 1994 about his 
      findings onboard the "Estonia" on the 27th September, 1994 has to be understood 
      in this respect. He said: "We went down to the cardeck and experienced a 
      lack of respect for loadline matters, and when we say this and we discussed 
      it with the Chief mate, we said we don't understand how come that this hatch 
      cover is open here? It has always to be closed and it has not been closed 
      for the last 1 or 2 years, and so on. I think it was in 2 or 3 places." 
      In the subsequently drawn up "Report of Inspection in Accordance with the 
      Memorandum of Understandiing on Port State Control" signed by him in Tallinn 
      on 27th September, 1994 Äke Sjöblom has a/o noted:<br>
      "1250 Covers on bulkhead deck to be closed."<br>
      Convention reference: LL66, C II-1<br>
      Action taken: 17 = to be rectified before departure" </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You know certainly much more from him as you have no doubt 
      spoken to him in detail. In any event he certainly does not know in what 
      condition the scuppers and other openings on bulkhead deck = cardeck were, 
      when the vessel departed from Tallinn. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">8.2. Lifts / Doors / Sills <br>
      There are 4 lifts inside the centre casing with openings to the cardeck 
      <br>
      - in the forward part a person-lift which goes via 1st Deck down to 0-Deck 
      (swimming pool/sauna);<br>
      - in the middle part a person-lift which ends on 1st Deck. Both lifts have 
      only 100 mm sills on cardeck level (the cardeck doors have 230 mm sills). 
      In addition there are 2 big store lifts further aft down to the provision/ 
      store area on the 1st Deck which have no sills at all (suitable for forklift). 
      It is thus possible for water to run from the cardeck through the lift casings 
      into 0-Deck (most forward lift) and straight into the 1st Deck (deck below 
      cardeck) into the accommodation area as well as in the provision area. Whilst 
      we have no evidence that there was water in way of the provision area (although 
      we assume that there was), there is a lot of evidence that there was water 
      in the accommodation area of the deck below cardeck and on the cardeck at 
      a time when the bow ramp was still only slightly open, i.e. before the major 
      starboard list commenced. The quotations below are part of the statements 
      of passengers having been in cabins below the cardeck. These statements 
      were taken by the criminal police soon after the rescue. </font></p>

      - a little later she heard a heavy sound above the cabin ceiling; <br>
      - she got the impression that something large and heavy was moving from 
      one point to the other; <br>
      - after these heavy scraping noises the vessel took the first list;<br>
      - Daniel jumped out of the cabin and shouted<i><b> that there was water 
      in the alleyway; <br>
      - she also saw that water trickled out on the floor before her cabin. </b></i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">All cabins are located on the 1st Deck at starboard side, 
      i.e. the deck below cardeck, with the exception of cabin 1056 - which is 
      located at port side but directly at the midship alleyway next to the 3rd 
      stairway (from forward) leading down from the cardeck - all other cabins 
      are located at the starboard side. In the same connection has to be seen 
      the conversation between Security Officer Ervin Rhoden and an unknown man 
      in Estonian language held in Södersjukhuset Hospital on 28.9.94, which was 
      overheard by Paula Liikamaa (casino employee). Paula testified to the police: 
      "The watchman whose 1st name is Ervin and surname is Rhoden said that he 
      had switched on his walkie-talkie when he was in his cabin, when he heard 
      another watchman - Silver Linde - say over his walkie-talkie that he was 
      on the cardeck and that there was a lot of water on the cardeck and that 
      they must leave the vessel." As Ervin Rhoden with absolute certainty did 
      not listen to any walkie-talkie communication after 01h02 when the abrupt 
      and severe port listing occurred it must have been before that time, i.e. 
      this is another indication that Silver Linde was on cardeck before 01h00 
      when there was already a lot of water.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> In summary of the above quoted extracts from statements 
      taken by the criminal police of Finland, Sweden or Estonia shortly after 
      the casualty it can be concluded with sufficient certainty that at the time 
      when the vessel took the first major starboard list, there had already been 
      so much water on the cardeck that <br>
      (a) it was able to flow over the 100 mm sills of the person-lift, run down 
      the casing to the 1st Deck, fill the deepening below the lift and fill part 
      of the alleyways between the cabins at starboard side, partly already penetrating 
      into the cabins;<br>
      (b) it was able to flow over the 230 mm high sills of the cardeck doors 
      and was rising inside the centre casing on cardeck level, simultaneously 
      flowing down the stairs to the deck below (water curtain). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">D. Summary of Observations made by Passengers and Crew on 
      different Decks</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In order to get as close as possible to the most probably 
      sequence of events we have carefully analysed the statements of passengers 
      and crew members made to the police shortly after their rescue. The various 
      statements of Silver Linde have not been taken into account. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Deck 8 : In the fore part were the accommodations of Master 
      and Chief engineer as well as the owners cabin, which was occupied by one 
      of the Stockholm pilots with his family. The Master and Chief engineer and 
      the Stockholm pilot with his family are missing. In the aft part are some 
      crew cabins and the day-rooms of officers and crew. After the first heavy 
      list to starboard one crew member looked out of one of the windows at starboard 
      side of the dayroom and saw "another ship in the sky ".<br>
      Note: This must have been "Silja Europa" then already abeam. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Deck 7 : This is the main accommodation deck for the crew 
      with 4 cabins in front of the superstructure which were used as follows: 
      (from starboard to port) <br>
      1st cabin starboard side: Economy superintendent Jan Bergendahl (did not 
      survive) <br>
      2nd cabin starboard side: Technical superintendent Tomas Rasmusson (not 
      onboard)<br>
      3rd cabin starboard side: Chief mate Juhan Herma (did not survive)<br>
      4th cabin starboard side: 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik (did not survive). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The windows of these cabins were overlooking the foreship 
      and it has to be assumed with certainty that the Chief mate and the 1st 
      Engineer did look out of their windows probably already after the first 
      severe bangs at 00h45/50 and at that time apparently saw nothing, therefore 
      it has to be assumed that the visor hinges and locking devices were not 
      yet broken at that time and that the visor was still in place, because otherwise 
      they would have alarmed the bridge already at that time and would have commenced 
      action much earlier. Consequently the bangs heard at 00h45/50 must be connected 
      to something different breaking, e.g. the bow ramp. About 10-15 minutes 
      later, i.e. shortly before 01h00 or at 01h00, also the visor hinges and 
      side locks broke and the visor moved forward/aft and somewhat up and down 
      within the 120 mm space between the fore part of the actuator-lugs underneath 
      the visor arms and the strong athwartships deck beam at frame 159. Each 
      time the visor had moved forward a gap of 100-120 mm opened athwartships 
      and water from the inside of the more or less full visor splashed out in 
      cascades and subsequently surged in depending on the movements of the vessel. 
      This was observed by Valter Kikuts, the deck passenger sitting with his 
      friend behind the windows at port side in the stairway on 7th Deck, i.e. 
      directly next to the cabin of 1st Eng. Arvo Tulvik and before the cabin 
      of 2nd Eng. Peeter Tüür. Kikuts has stated to have seen this gap opening/closing 
      already at 00h36 which appears to be impossible, 00h56 is the more likely 
      time. In any event it was obviously seen by 1st Eng. Arvo Tulvik already 
      before or immediately after the 1st heavy listing to starboard, i.e. at 
      about 01h02. He had apparently left his cabin and walked aft when 2nd Eng. 
      Peeter Tüür opened his cabin door and Arvo Tulvik said to Peeter Tüür: "Apparently 
      the visor broke up, would be good if the vessel would be beached." This 
      was also heard by the Reefer engineer Andres Verro, who left his cabin at 
      the same time. Based on the apparent fact (see statement Mikael Öun and 
      many others) that the 1st severe starboard list occurred at 01h02, Arvo 
      Tulvik must have made his observation before that time, i.e. probably at 
      some minutes before or at 01h00, as it is most unlikely that the 1st Engineer 
      would have stayed in his cabin much longer than a couple of minutes (to 
      phone the bridge knowing that they can see only the tip of the visor and 
      his boss, the Chief engineer one deck above him, who as well as the master 
      can see from their cabin windows nothing at all of the visor, finally to 
      get dressed and leave the cabin). That's when he met Peeter Tüür and Andres 
      Verro. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Consequently it has to be considered an established fact 
      that the visor hinges and side locks broke at 01h00 or some minutes before. 
      </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Next relevant observations made / noises heard by crew-members 
      and passengers shall be summarised as stated below: </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>2nd Eng. Peeter Tüür:</i></b><br>
      - woke up by things moving around in his cabin<br>
      - had heard before metallic bangs apparently caused by objects hitting against 
      each other <br>
      - thought the noises came from badly secured lifeboat or<i><b> that the 
      visor had gone loose; </b></i><br>
      - <i><b>felt that the speed was reduced </b></i>and that there was a starboard 
      list of about 30°;<br>
      - opened the cabin door and met the 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik who said: <b><i>"Apparently 
      the visor broke up, would be good if the vessel would be beached." </i></b><br>
      <i><b>Note</b></i>: The cabin of 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik is on 7th Deck, 
      port side, in front of the accommodation. From the window he can overlook 
      the foreship with visor. The above remark from Arvo Tulvik was also heard 
      by the Reefer Engineer Andres Verro (see his statement). <br>
      - Next he heard "Mr. Skylight 1 and 2", which means according to Peeter 
      Tüür's understanding: "Fire Alarm", the 2 fire-fighting teams had to go 
      to their stations <br>
      - he was No. 1 of team No. 1 and his station was on the 8th Deck - port 
      side;<br>
      - he went back to his cabin, picked up walkie-talkie and flashlight, left 
      via window (due to the list) and went to Deck 8; <br>
      - at that time he was confident that there was the risk that the vessel 
      might sink; <br>
      - heard on his walkie-talkie that the Information Desk tried to reach the 
      bridge, but got no answer; <br>
      - he tried it himself but also got no answer; <br>
      - light went out but came back (auxiliary shut off and start of emergency 
      generator); <br>
      - after 4-5 minutes also this generator stopped - vessel on the side - and 
      thereafter only emergency lights fed by batteries. <br>
      <i><b>Note:</b></i> This was 01h31. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Andres Verro </i></b>- Reefer Engineer - cabin 710 
      - 35 years. <br>
      - was in cabin; <br>
      - at ca. 01h00 was in bed reading a book when the vessel suddenly listed 
      to starboard; <br>
      - heard by radio "Mr. Skylight 1 and 2" which means actually "Fire Alarm" 
      spoken by a male voice; <br>
      - believes that he heard <i><b>before the list</b></i> some strange metallic 
      sounds;<br>
      - when he left his cabin he met the 1st and 2nd Engineers, one of them said: 
      "Visor went away" (or something like that); <br>
      - he got the impression <i><b>that possibly the fastening clips of the bow 
      ramp had failed and through them water came in. </b></i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Aarne Koppel</i></b> at Turku - 29.9.94 - cabin 7011: 
      <br>
      - 5°-10° starboard list, felt it was an unnormal situation and woke up <br>
      - heard a low breaking sound; <br>
      - at 01h00 - when we got dressed - the vessel suddenly listed to ca. 30°; 
      <br>
      - when I was still in the cabin putting on warm clothes the light went out/on 
      several times, that was when the main engines stopped;<br>
      - it took ca. 5 minutes from the moment I woke up from the 5° list to my 
      leaving the cabin through the window, which was at the high port side. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Elmer Siegel</i></b> - motorman - cabin 7007 - 43 
      years. Statement taken 29.9.94 at Mariehamn:<br>
      - was in cabin on 7th Deck aft; <br>
      - 3-5 minutes before list started heard noise<i><b> like somebody beating 
      against vessel's hull with a large hammer which came from cardeck direction. 
      </b></i></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Andres Vihmar</b> - cabin 713 - 7th Deck 
      (cabin is located 20 m aft from front bulkhead)<br>
      - 5-7 minutes after 1st listing the list was already 45°;<br>
      - when he came to the boat area on 7th Deck port side<i><b> Aulis Lee and 
      Aarne Koppel were already there;</b></i> <br>
      - people were streaming up to the 7th Deck through the open doors for another 
      ca. 5 minutes, thereafter it was no longer possible due to the list and 
      no one escaped anymore from the inside of the vessel. <br>
      <i><b>Note:</b></i> This means that already after ca. 01h15 it was no longer 
      possible to get out of the inside of the accommodation. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Summary of observations made / noises heard 
      on Deck 7 and 8 </font></b><font size="2"><br>
      <i><b> a) Before the starboard list: </b></i>1st Engineer saw visor moving 
      / loose / broken up and various crew members heard metallic noises and as 
      if somebody was beating with a large hammer against vessel's hull which 
      came from cardeck. <br>
      <i><b>b) After the starboard list: </b></i><br>
      - there was a vessel about abeam at starboard side<br>
      - probably "Silja Europa"; <br>
      - speed was reduced and subsequently the engines stopped after the list 
      was 30° or more; <br>
      - the Information Desk as well as 2nd Eng. Tüür tried to reach the bridge 
      by walkie-talkie - ca. 01h10/01h12 - both got no reply; <br>
      - already after ca. 01h15 it was no longer possible for anybody to get out 
      of the vessel due to the excessive list. </font></p>
