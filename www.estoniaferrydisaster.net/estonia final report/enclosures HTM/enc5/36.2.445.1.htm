    according to our laws that means that you are required to tell the truth. 
    The ferry 'ESTONIA', when did you go on board?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Ca. 17.00 hours Swedish time on board, ca. 1 hour before 
    departure.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <b><i>CP</i></b>: Which deck?<br>
    </font><font size="2"> <i><b>MNR:</b></i> 1st Deck way down.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><i><b>CP:</b></i> You also had a friend in this cabin?<br>
    MNR: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP:</b></i> What had happened, when did you go to bed? 
    <br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: No, well we had separated, he said he wanted to go to sleep 
    and I didn't want to sleep yet and so I stayed upstairs in the Bar. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: This was Mr. Keller?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: And you were in the Bar?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: That was on Deck 5?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: Behind the Supermarket?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, the Supermarket was on the right when you entered, 
    that is there were automats, supermarket automats, and then the entrance to 
    the Bar was on the left.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP:</b></i> This then was the Info-Deck?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, so up front was the Information, way in front, and 
    in the back towards the stern there was a staircase so that you could go up 
    to the last deck, then there was an alleyway like in between. You could practically 
    walk from the Bar by a very short walk up to the deck, thus outdoors.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: Is known?<br>
    <i><b>MNR:</b></i> Well it was like this, at first, this was about 10 minutes 
    before the main occurrence, the first glasses of the row fell down, it was 
    so, there is this bar, a bar-counter and above it there is like a wooden rack 
    and then it has these two rails and there the glasses were hanging, upside 
    down, Cognac glasses and there 2 or 3 glasses fell down, that is the first 
    ones in the row fell down and broke, and then the staff took down all the 
    glasses that were hanging up there and packed them into like a box, into like 
    a plastic box. And that was put next to the kitchen, there is sort of a provisions 
    room there - so here was the Bar and then there was a door and then there 
    was like a provisions room, there they put the glasses, utensils and plates 
    and what all they have, that was put into there and then came the main occurrence, 
    i.e. there was a bang and then all at once all the utensils came flying out 
    of the kitchen. Also the whole box, everything came flying out and was caught 
    behind the bar-counter and that is why no one was injured. The bar-counter 
    was positioned slightly in front of the door, so that means that the exit 
    of counter and the door exit are slightly misaligned and that's why all the 
    utensils flew out, the glasses flew out against the counter, that is everything 
    came out all at once and the staff was surprised and especially the barman 
    looked particularly surprised and he then reacted immediately, left, went 
    up and then the people followed him, so did I.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: How quickly did the ship start to the other 
    side?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, well she practically already had a heel with the first 
    bang, so she was already slanting and then she stabilized herself to about 
    70°, that is the angle to the surface of the water, then there was another 
    bang, then it was about 45° thereabouts, and then she went way down, so that 
    the surface of the water and the side of the ship were on one level, that 
    is the outboard side.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: Which side?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Ahh, just a moment, it was the Stb. Port side, that is 
    it was the left side, the left side was up. The left was up, the right was 
    under water, because in front was the stern ahhh the bow.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: How long did it take for the ship to go 
    to 90°?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Well, hmm, well the whole action, I guess not longer than 
    well about 20-30 minutes, well 30 at maximum, it was probably shorter more 
    like 20 minutes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP:</b></i> At maximum half an hour?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, that's my guess, but I didn't look at a clock. But 
    everything went fairly quickly, well first the listing, the first bang, the 
    second bang and then she was already on the (water's) surface and then she 
    already sank right away. The suction started at the stern. I stood against 
    the ship's wall, like this, pooh, [not understandable], i.e. dull, more like 
    slamming when a wave came and was beating at the front, it was like that the 
    whole time, that you can tell apart. It was like when a large object hits 
    a wall, well really like a WAM and then it already had this slanting angle 
    and that's why then all the utensils flew out. It was because it was sloping.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: And what can you say about the motors, 
    the engines?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, at the first bang. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP: </i></b>…..had they already stopped then?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes afterwards nothing was on anymore, yes that's true 
    then when we were outboards, well they had stopped then, but at the time when 
    the bang came they were naturally still running. That was not foreseeable 
    that there. And the light was still on for a long time, that is the lighting, 
    that was on for a relatively long time. Not until the boat practically, until 
    the funnel let off this whistle, then she went down and then the light was 
    out. That was shortly before the boat was completely under water.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><i><b>CP</b></i>: If you think of this so-called, as you say, 
    first bang as being the zero mark, how long was there lighting on the ship?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes, well I can only guess well to the outside I would 
    say a good 20 minutes, if you presume 30 minutes at maximum, that was still 
    relatively long, we weren't standing sitting in the dark, the storm was still 
    there.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: Mr. Rothe, could one think that the vessel 
    was hit by a mine?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: No, no possibility, because there wasn't any explosion, 
    there has to be an explosion, No and then it's like this if a mine is hit, 
    then she sinks within 3 minutes, if she really hits it, then she's gone. I 
    think that is out of the question. And then there wasn't any jet (of water), 
    nothing, there has to be something. Water shooting out, if (it was) a mine. 
    I was in the Army, I think it is out of the question, because then the time 
    span was too long. You know nothing happened there and there was a bang against 
    the ship's side and that was certainly from a truck or something similar. 
    Well a mine, that can't be, I think that is out of the question. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: … and, no explosives at all?" <br>
    <b><i>MNR</i></b>: No, because that sounds different, there would then be 
    an explosion, a loud one, a detonation that would hurt your ears. And that 
    is so even just with a hand-grenade, well when you ignite a practice hand-grenade 
    you have to hold your ears shut. I was in the Army and I know what that's 
    like and what an explosion is like, so no way, it was much too thud-like. 
    Even if the water dampens it, but there was nothing like that there, I think 
    it is out of the question.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: What were the alarms like on the ship? 
    <br>
    <i><b>MNR:</b></i> I didn't hear anything, no nothing, there should have been 
    well a toot-toot like alarm, I didn't hear anything, absolutely nothing.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: And nobody said anything over the loud-speakers? 
    <br>
    <i><b>MNR:</b></i> Yes well the problem with these loud-speakers was that 
    the messages were mostly in Estonian or Swedish, the whole messages, only 
    partly in English. Well that was actually a problem, the languages. For the 
    people who naturally understand Estonian or Swedish, for the others like West 
    Europeans it is actually pretty difficult.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: Do you understand English? <br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> <i><b>CP</b></i>: Did they say anything in English?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: I didn't hear anything, although I have to add this, I 
    was outside then, through the wind if the loud-speaker speaks in that direction 
    and the wind is blowing you don't hear anything, you could then practically 
    be standing in front of it and I think the wind was pretty strong. Well personally 
    I didn't hear anything, when I was inside the ship. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b><i>CP</i></b>: What did the staff do?<br>
    <i><b>MNR</b></i>: Nothing…… </font></p>
