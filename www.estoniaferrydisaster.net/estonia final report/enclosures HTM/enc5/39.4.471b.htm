  <p><b><font size="2">Deck 6 :</font></b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> Only in the forward 1/3 of this deck were 
      passenger cabins located, the expensive ones. In the larger part the A-la-Carte 
      Restaurant, other restaurants and bars as well as boutiques could be found. 
      Before referring to the testimony of passengers having been in the cabins 
      on this deck we would like to outline the summary of the statement of Mats 
      Hillerström, who was actually staying in cabin 1026 below cardeck, but felt 
      unwell and scared and thus moved up to the aft and open part of Deck 6 already 
      after midnight ship's time, ca. 00h30! Below are his observations in short: 
      He stayed in a sheltered place at starboard side best protected against 
      the storm and heard nothing but the noises of the storm. The air was full 
      of spray. At some time he saw a large vessel at starboard side apparently 
      on same course and speed. Also at starboard side but far away and astern 
      there was another vessel which was slower, because the distance appeared 
      to increase. Suddenly and without any previous indication the vessel listed 
      to starboard. He saw the tables and chairs inside the restaurant moving 
      to starboard. Within a very short time the vessel took such a list that 
      he could no more walk on the deck, but had to pull himself along the railing 
      at the aft part to the higher port side. When he had reached the port side 
      he looked over the side and got the impression that the <i><b>vessel had 
      reduced speed and was turning to port.</b></i> He worked himself up to 7th 
      Deck and when he had reached the outer railing he looked again over the 
      side<i><b> and saw the stabilizer fin just sticking out of the water</b></i> 
      (probably 2-3 minutes after the list).<br>
      <i><b>Note</b></i>: When the fin comes out of the water the vessel has a 
      list of 20°. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b><i>Per-Erik Ehrnsten</i></b> - cabin 6304 
      - 28.9.94 <br>
      - tried to sleep, but was kept awake by hard noises created by the ferry 
      slamming into high seas, however what kept him awake in particular were 
      the indefinable shocks, which deviated from the normal noises of the ferry. 
      <br>
      - the shocks and the noises repeated themselves indefinably regularly 4-5 
      times. "Tong-tong, tong, tong"; noise, short pause and the same again. <br>
      <i><b>- he got up and started to dress when the ferry suddenly listed and 
      the furniture was sliding against the door. </b></i><br>
      - the mentioned noise came from below and from forward.<br>
      - the noise was not caused by the sea and also was not a sudden sound like 
      an explosion but it was regular, each unit - tong, tong, was equally strong, 
      a little pause and the same regularity.<br>
      - It was no impact noise (collision, grounding). <br>
      <i><b>- In his opinion the list remained for quite some time at 30°-50°.<br>
      - The funnel was pointing in the direction where the wind came from. </b></i><br>
      <i><b>Note:</b></i> That means that the vessel was then on an approximate 
      SE-ly heading, i.e. almost on opposite course. She had turned around ca. 
      150° to port. </font></p>

      cabin 6222 - 59 years. <br>
      - slept in her cabin with her husband<br>
      - lots of noises in the vessel woke her up<br>
      - it was so terrible, asked her husband for the time: <i><b>00.00 hrs.</b></i> 
      (Swedish time). <br>
      - shortly afterwards the vessel was diving into a deep wave, there was a 
      heavy bang <br>
      - the vessel listed severely and the e<i><b>ngines stopped.</b></i><br>
      <i><b>- before she had already noticed that something was beating heavily

      - in bed - could not sleep - suddenly she heard "ett brak" = one crash - 
      this was a loud bang and thereafter the vessel started to list to starboard. 
      on 1.10.94:<br>
      - in bed - heard a heavy loud noise - 'bom' - a noise of the type that makes 
      you realize at once that something is wrong.<br>
      - The vessel listed substantially and maintained the list to starboard.<br>
      - Upon being questioned with what she could associate the noise 'bom' she 
      said it came from the bottom of the vessel, from the same hull, a clear, 
      distinct 'bom' - not rattle.<br>
      - When she reached the deck above, i.e. 7th Deck, she looked at her watch 
      and it was <i><b>00h05 Swedish time = 01h05 ship's time. </b></i></font></p>

      - ca. 24h00 went to bed - ca. 01h00 was woken up by his wife because the 
      vessel took a list to port which he tried to explain to her by the weather. 
      Immediately thereafter the vessel listed very severely to starboard and 
      everything loose moved to starboard side, blocking the door. <br>
      - It took them about 5 minutes to open the door, at that time the list was 
      already so large that they walked in the angle between wall and floor on 
      their way up to 7th Deck, i.e. 45°. <br>
      - Lamke stood at the part outside when the vessel was already lying on her 
      side and he was washed off the vessel by a sea, thereby the glass of his 
      wristwatch was smashed in and the watch stopped at <i><b>00h31 Swedish time 
      = 01h31. </b></i>This is the time when the list had reached or exceeded

    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Summary of observations made / noises heard 
      by passengers on Deck 6:</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"> <font size="2"><b>a) Before the starboard list: </b><br>
      - indefinable shocks and noises which were repeated regularly 4-5 times 
      "tong-tong-tong-tong", which came from forward and below and were not created 
      by wave impact; <br>
      - something was beating heavily against the vessel; <br>
      - vessel was diving into a deep wave - heavy bang - starboard list - engines 
      stopped;<br>
      - one crash - starboard list; - heavy, loud noise: BOM; <br>
      - one vessel starboard side abeam, the other one starboard astern. <br>
      <b>b) After the initial starboard list</b>: <br>
      - ca. 2-3 minutes after list stabilizer fin out of the water, i.e. then 
      the starboard list was 20°; - vessel in port turn with reduced speed;<br>
      - vessel stabilized for quite some time with a list between 30°-50°;<br>
      - funnel was pointing in the direction where the wind came from; <br>
      - 01h31 vessel on her side with 90° or more list. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Deck 5 : </b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">Also Deck 5 has the same lay-out as Deck 6, 
      i.e. only the forward ca. 1/3 is arranged for passenger accommodation. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"> <b>Birgit Eriksson</b> - cabin 5229 - <br>
      - at about 23h00 the vessel began to move and labour heavily in the seas;<br>
      - woke up <i><b>by noises indicating that steel plates were knocking against 
      steel plates.</b></i><br>
      - <i><b>Almost immediately after these steel-to-steel noises the vessel 
      listed heavily to starboard. </b></i>The steel-to-steel noise came either 
      from the visor or the bow ramp, the direction where the noises came from 
      was forward. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Leif Bogren</b> - cabin 5128 (5th Deck, 
      port side forward) </font></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="2">Protocol 1.10.94 </font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"><b><i>- to bed at 23h30 (Swedish time)</i></b><i>.</i><br>
      - vessel behaved like a small boat also does when slamming over the waves<br>
      - explains the many noises created by a vessel proceeding against heavy 
      seas - <br>
      - so he was lying there and listened and suddenly there was the bom-bom, 
      which was no more the same noise, it was not a good noise, <br>
      - he continued lying still and listening, and was fascinated about why they 
      were proceeding so fast? <br>
      -<i><b> from the time he went to bed</b></i> to the first unusual noise 
      bom-bom to when the engines stopped <i><b>maybe 10-15 minutes had passed,</b></i> 
      i.e. it was 23h40/23h45 Swedish time;<br>
      - at first there was an additional sound with this bom - an enormous bom-bom 
      - then came bom. - he was lying awake and then came the next BOM. This was 
      definitely a different noise, now the sea was higher and they were proceeding 
      slowly against it and then came the next VROM BOM, now they were smashing 
      in the hull plates of the vessel and then there was also a CRASH.<br>
      <i><b>- Now they must go down to half speed was his next thought, and the 
      engines stopped.</b></i><br>
      - Had they reduced to half ahead he would not have felt uneasy, but to stop 
      the engines? Engines are not stopped from full ahead and <i><b>at that time 
      the vessel had not yet started to list to starboard. <br>
      - Ca. 1 minute after the engines had stopped the vessel listed to starboard 
      (20°), </b></i><br>
      - It took him ca. 5 min. to reach Deck 7 (2 decks up) and then the vessel 
      had a list of already ca. 45°.<br>
      <i><b>Note: </b></i>The vessel is fitted with 2 pitch propellers which can 
      be controlled either directly or via the combinator. In all probability 
      the pitch propellers were working in the combinator mode, i.e. to reduce 
      the speed from full to e.g. slow ahead the pitch was reduced and through 
      the combinator subsequently also the revolutions according to a certain 
      electronic program. A passenger in a cabin or in some restaurant can notice 
      a pitch change only by a change of vibration. If, for example, the pitch 
      is changed to maintain a speed of 6 kn the vibration level will totally 
      disappear in the passenger cabin and the passenger has the impression that 
      the engines have stopped. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2">- Bogren has in the course of his working life 
      also worked at a shipyard and is therefore acquainted with metallic noises. 
      He also in a way is acquainted with the sea as he has a pleasure boat.<br>
      - Bogren described the sound as if somebody was beating with a sledge-hammer 
      against vessel's shell plating or hull. <i><b>He noticed the noise 3 times 
      within 2 minutes. </b></i><br>
      - He had the impression that the noises came from forward, port side and 
      from below. <br>
      - Bogren stated that the vessel did not roll, but was pitching against the 
      waves. </font></p>

        port inner side: Mikael Öun Eckard Klug <br>
        starboard outside: Tony Spuhl </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The respective statements are summarised as follows: </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Anders Eriksson</i></b> - cabin 4131 - 45 years. <br>
      - was on bridge at 20h00/20h30 - noted course 262°, wind: 20 m/sec. - 2 
      watch officers, <br>
      - went to cabin at 22h15 (Swedish time), but impossible to sleep, each time 
      the vessel met a wave it was shaking/vibrating severely;<br>
      - ca. 24h00 (Swedish time) <i><b>came suddenly 2 heavy bangs,</b></i> <i><b>one 
      straight after the other</b></i>, he realized that something must be wrong, 
      thus got up and dressed himself - he had the feeling t<i><b>hat the noises 
      came from nearby his cabin</b></i> (2nd cabin port outside from forward 
      and only ca. 20 m away from the visor hinges);<br>
      - he opened the cabin door, looked out and saw nobody, he went along the 
      alleyway to midships and then followed the alleyway aft. <i><b>When he had 
      made about 2/3 of the way to the large centre stairway the vessel suddenly 
      listed to starboard</b></i> (he walked ca. 32 m, i.e. incl. opening door, 
      looking out and walking ca. 32 m it should have taken ca. 1 minute); <br>
      - he waited a short while for the ferry to upright itself again, which did 
      not happen. He continued to the centre stairway and went up the stairs. 
      The list increased.<br>
      <i><b>- When he reached the 6th Deck the listing stopped at about 30°. </b></i><br>
      - At Deck 7 he opened the door to outside with 2 other persons. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Einar Kuk</i></b> - Trainee officer - cabin 4103 <br>
      - at about 00h00 Silver Linde returned from his safety round to the bridge 
      and said everything was o.k.<br>
      - 5-10 minutes later he left the bridge and went to his cabin, cleared up 
      some matters and went to the Pub (where also Karaoke was performed). <br>
      - There he saw Silver Linde in the door at about 00h40. Kuk left after some 
      minutes and went to his cabin. There he arrived at 00h50, went to bed, but 
      could not sleep.<br>
      <i><b>- After 5-10 minutes he heard a strange noise which was very unusual</b></i> 
      (and alarming) to him; got up and dressed; whilst he was putting on his 
      shoes <i><b>the vessel took a starboard list,</b></i> he cannot say how 
      much, <br>
      - he rushed up to the 7th Deck, - when he was between 6th/7th Deck he noted 
      a shock/vibration inside the vessel. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>Mikael Öun </i></b>- cabin 4217 - 29.9.94 <br>
      - was in bed but could not sleep, <br>
      - close to 01h00 he noted that the vessel's movements changed, i.e. whilst 
      the vessel had so far been pitching it now started to roll 3°-5°, <br>
      - after a heavy wave<i><b> impact he heard 2-3 severe scraping noises from 
      forward - this was at 01h01 </b></i><br>
      - followed by a slight listing to starboard and some things fell down, <br>
      - directly thereafter followed a very severe listing and now everything 
      loose was rushing to starboard.</font></p>
    <p> <font size="2"><i><b>Mikael Öun </b></i>- cabin 4217 - 4.10.94<br>
      - was in bed and continuously heard banging noises which he believed were 
      caused by the waves hitting against the bow; <br>
      - he slept a bit and <i><b>woke up again and finally was fully awake when 
      he heard a particularly loud bang</b></i> and because <i><b>the vessel started 
      to behave differently in the sea-state.</b></i><br>
      - he noticed that <i><b>the vessel started to roll from side to side</b></i> 
      instead of pitching against the sea.<br>
      <i><b>- he also heard 3 heavy scraping noises which followed straight one 
      after the other with some seconds in between and after these scraping noises 
      the vessel took a severe list. <br>
      - at first there was heavy movement of the vessel and a slight list remained 
      and the vessel remained with that list for a while,</b></i><br>
      -<i><b> a little later </b></i>the list <i><b>suddenly increased severely 
      </b></i>and everything loose moved toward the cabin door. <br>
      - he got out of his bed, put on some clothes and removed the loose objects 
      from the door in order to open it.<br>
      - before he left the cabin he took his camera and the alarm clock. <br>
      -<i><b> the alarm clock had stopped at 00h02 (Swedish time)</b></i> because 
      the moment it fell from the table, due to the sudden listing, the batteries 
      had become disengaged and the clock stopped. <br>
      <i><b>- Consequently the time of the 1st heavy listing to starboard was 
      01h02 ship's time. </b></i></font></p>
    <p><b><i><font size="2">Eckard Klug</font></i></b><font size="2"> - cabin 
      4214 - 54 years.<br>
      - was in bed, heard many bangs which he had never heard on his many previous 
      voyages, in his opinion these were cars floating on the cardeck; <br>
      -<i><b> in his opinion the unsecured cars and trucks had moved forward against 
      the bow ramp due to the hard setting in of vessel's bow and forced the bow 
      ramp open and this is the cause of the casualty; </b></i><br>
      - Klug heard<i><b> in addition to the above explained bangs a bang which 
      was heavy as if breaking of a thick plate; </b></i><br>
      - they got up <i><b>and by the time he had reached the cabin door the starboard 
      list started; </b></i><br>
      - when he reached the boat-deck the list was about 30°. </font></p>

      - could not sleep due to labouring of vessel, - looked frequently out of 
      the window, <br>
      - listened for the noises which the bow created when smashing into the waves 
      and <i><b>thought spontaneously that the vessel should not be going so fast 
      against such waves, </b></i><br>
      - he <i><b>noted after a while that the engine noises became different and 
      he got the impression that the vessel reduced the speed.</b></i> <br>
      - he was lying there and continued to listen to the noises and the roaring 
      was quite severe when the waves slammed against the bow. <br>
      - <i><b>after a while he heard an enormous crash and the whole vessel was 
      shaking/vibrating. </b></i><br>
      - he looked out of the window and is not really sure whether the vessel 
      was proceeding ahead or was lying still (did not move).<br>
      - the normal roaring noises remained when the bow was slamming into the 
      waves, <i><b>but then came "2 metallic noises, which sounded like "klonk-klonk" 
      directly after the bow was setting into the sea.</b></i><br>
      - when the next wave hit the bow Tony Spuhl heard something which <i><b>sounded 
      like "klonk-klonk-klonk", 3 times. Directly thereafter he heard a rushing 
      noise below his cabin. The noise came from the cardeck</b></i>.<br>
      - he was lying still in his bed and heard <i><b>this rushing sound once 
      more. </b></i><br>
      - his wife René by then was also awake and he said: "Something is wrong, 
      we must get out of the cabin." <br>
      - Whilst Spuhl was jumping out of his bed, he saw René <i><b>opening the

      not sleep, he heard continuous '"small banging noises" which did not appear 
      to him to be natural. <br>
      - after a certain time, cannot say how much later, <i><b>he heard 3 "bangs"

      side and simultaneously he heard below himself the noise of a large object 
      moving from port to starboard. After some seconds he jumped out of bed and

      when the vessel suddenly listed to starboard and did not come upright again.<br>
      - He looked out of his window straight into the sea and saw the waves smashing 
      against the window. <br>
      <i><b>Note</b></i>: In upright condition the windows on 4th Deck are 8,8 
      m above waterline, at a starboard list of 20° the windows are still ca. 
      4,5 m above water level. If the vessel would still have been on or about 
      a course of 287°, i.e. with wind and sea some 3-4 points from port side, 
      the starboard side would be the lee side and no waves would smash 4,5 m 
      up against windows. It has thus to be assumed that the vessel at the time 
      of the first severe starboard list had altered course to port already and 
      was probably heading South. </font></p>

      - Ca. 23h45 (Swedish time) = 00h45 ship's time he heard a dull bang and 
      ca. ½ minute later a similar bang, these were really sharp and short sounds 
      which he clearly heard in spite of the music. The vessel was shaking somewhat. 
      The noises were not created by waves striking against the bow; <br>
      - after a while he heard an enormous crash and the whole vessel was shaking 
      / vibrating; <br>
      - got lost and ended up on the 2nd cardeck, where she heard a CRASH; <br>
      - time before the vessel fell on the side he felt that the vessel's whole

      - shortly before the list started the vessel began to roll equally in the 
      waves from side to side and he means that then the vessel did not have the 
      sea from ahead. <i><b>At that time he did not feel the engines; </b></i><br>
      - he looked out of the window and is not really sure whether the vessel 
      was proceeding ahead or was lying still (did not move). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>as to c.) Movements on cardeck </b><br>
      - Was in bed, heard many bangs which he had never heard on his many previous, 
      in his opinion these were cars floating on the cardeck; <br>
      - at midnight he heard strange noises, was awake and noted that the noises 
      came from the cardeck, it appeared as if something was rolling over the 
      cardeck.</font></p>
    <p> <font size="2"><b>as to d.) Several bangs, etc. and starboard list </b><br>
      - Cabin 24h00 Swedish time = 01h00 ship's time came<i><b> suddenly 2 heavy 
      bangs, one straight after the other,</b></i> he realized that something 
      must be wrong, thus got up and dressed himself<br>
      - he had the feeling that the nosies came from nearby his cabin (2nd cabin 
      port outside from forward and only ca. 20 m away from the visor hinges); 
      <br>
      - he opened the cabin door, looked out and saw nobody, he went along the 
      alleyway to midships and then followed the alleyway aft. <i><b>When he had 
      made about 2/3 of the way to the large centre stairway the vessel suddenly 
      listed to starboard </b></i>(he walked ca. 32 m, i.e. incl. opening door, 
      looking out and walking ca. 32 m it should have taken ca. 1 minute);<br>
      - At 00h50 he went to bed, but could not sleep, <br>
      <i><b>- after 5-10 minutes he heard a strange noise which was very unusual</b></i> 
      (and alarming) to him; got up and dressed; whilst he was putting on his 
      shoes<i><b> the vessel took a starboard list</b></i>, he cannot say how 
      much; <br>
      - he noticed that<i><b> the vessel started to roll from side to side</b></i> 
      instead of pitching against the sea;<br>
      <i><b>- he also heard 3 heavy scraping noises which followed straight one 
      after the other with some seconds in between and after these scraping noises 
      the vessel took a severe list.; </b></i><br>
      <i><b>- at first there was heavy movement of the vessel and a slight list 
      remained and the vessel remained with that list for a while; </b></i><br>
      - <i><b>a little later </b></i>the list<i><b> suddenly increased severely</b></i> 
      and everything loose moved toward the cabin door; <br>
      <i><b>- the alarm clock had stopped at 00h02 Swedish time = 01h02 ship's 
      time </b></i>because the moment it fell from the table, due to the sudden 
      listing, the batteries had become disengaged and the clock stopped. <br>
      - Ca. 3 minutes after he had heard the first noises he felt that the vessel 
      was swinging/rocking athwartships (Note: He probably means pitching.) not 
      just from side to side. He was very surprised about the behaviour of the 
      vessel; <br>
      - these swinging movements repeated themselves 3-4 times simultaneously, 
      the vessel was shaking somewhat and ca. 10 minutes after he had heard the 
      first noises the vessel began to roll from side to side, and thereafter 
      remained with a starboard list of 10°-15°. <br>
      - In connection with this rolling the vessel listed to starboard and he 
      heard something below them rushing over to starboard. According to the noise 
      this came from some place below them (Note: They were on Deck 4, i.e. above 
      cardeck.) and must have been some large object; <br>
      - shortly after this noise he felt that the vessel listed more to starboard. 
      <br>
      - The normal roaring noises remained when the bow was slamming into the 
      waves,<i><b> but then came "2 metallic noises, which sounded like "klonk-klonk" 
      directly after the bow was setting into the sea; </b></i><br>
      - when the next wave hit the bow Tony Spuhl heard something which <i><b>sounded 
      like "klonk-klonk-klonk", 3 times. Directly thereafter he heard a rushing 
      noise below his cabin. The noise came from the cardeck;</b></i><br>
      - he was lying still in his bed and heard this rushing sound once more; 
      <br>
      - his wife René by then was also awake and he said: "Something is wrong, 
      we must get out of the cabin."; <br>
      - whilst Spuhl was jumping out of his bed, he saw René <i><b>opening the 
      door, at this very moment the vessel listed suddenly to starboard.</b></i><br>
      - After a certain time, cannot say how much later,<i><b> he heard 3 "bangs" 
      one after the other. Between the first and the 2nd a car alarm sounded below 
      him, but not after the 3rd one which came from port side.<br>
      - Shortly afterwards the ferry listed to (he said port) must be starboard 
      side and simultaneously he heard below himself the noise of a large object 
      moving from port to starboard. After some seconds he jumped out of bed and 
      left the cabin.</b></i><br>
      - After the rolling he heard one heavy bang and at the same time the vessel 
      took a slight list of 10-15° to starboard. It is difficult to state that 
      more exactly as the vessel was still pitching and rolling.<br>
      - Apparently must have slept, because she stated having<i><b> woken up due 
      to a "crash" and the vessel was shaking, whereafter she felt that the vessel 
      listed. </b></i><br>
      - He decided to go to his cabin and walked up to Deck 5, had a brief look 
      into the Karaoke Bar and continued to his cabin;<br>
      - when he was in the area of the Tax Free Store the vessel suddenly listed

      - bow thruster room <br>
      - waterballast tank <br>
      - 6 compartments passenger cabins<br>

    <p><font size="2"> The passenger accommodation was accessible by 2 person 
      lifts and 6 stairways inside the centre casing. The forward lift and the 
      stairway in the 4th compartment continued down to 0-Deck level (swimming 
      pool, saunas), the remainder ended on 1st Deck level. The store area was 
      accessible by 2 large lifts and 1 stairway. The person lifts had opening 
      to starboard side only with sills of 100 mm height, the fwd. store lift 
      had a door to starboard, whilst the aft one had doors to both sides. Both 
      store lifts had no sills at all. The sliding doors on cardeck level leading 
      from cardeck into the centre casing above the 1st Deck had sills of 130 
      mm above the 100 mm sill running around the centre casing just interrupted 
      in way of the 2 store lifts, i.e. the sills of the sliding doors had a total 
      height of 230 mm. </font></p>

    <p> <font size="2">Martin Nilsson - cabin 1027 - 22 years.<br>
      - to bed 23h00-23h30, noticed heavy movements of vessel and lots of cracking 
      noises. He also heard that something was frequently heavily beating against 
      the vessel;<br>
      - about 10-15 minutes before the accident became a fact he woke up from 
      the heavy movement of the vessel, heard a scraping noise, i.e. it was cracking 
      and scraping very close to him on the deck above him. This was (for him) 
      the introduction to the developments which ended in the catastrophe.<br>
      - a little later Martin felt that the noises were connected to the shaking 
      of the vessel and thereafter the vessel began to list notably, whilst at 
      the same time the noises from the shaking/vibrating were still there and 
      somebody said: "Now we have run aground." So well it was noticeable. <br>
      - he left the cabin and jumped up one flight of stairs to the next deck, 
      where he noted some cm of water on the bottom; - when he had reached the 
      boatdeck he observed 2 crew members talking into walkie-talkies; <br>
      - a search light was shining from vessel's side into the water; - saw the 
      lights of a ferry far away.</font></p>

      - went at 22h00 on deck also to forward - could not see anything unnormal 
      - <i><b>it was very dark; </b></i><br>
      - was there twice again later - no change except increasing storm and higher 
      seas;<br>
      - at ca. 23h00 - must be Swedish time - he went to bed, but could not sleep 
      due to heavy labouring of the vessel and something beating frequently against 
      the hull very heavily; <br>
      - he noted after an hour or so <i><b>that it began to roar (scream, howl), 
      to squeak and shriek and scrape, and formed the opinion that something was 
      wrong.</b></i><br>
      - When he had reached that conclusion the vessel started to list to starboard.<br>
      - He opened his door and saw Martin Nilsson jumping past him. <br>
      - When he reached the deck above <i><b>(cardeck) he saw water coming from

      of the engine room and returned to the ECR, whereafter Margus Treu made 
      his round; <br>
      - sometime later the bridge ordered to activate the stabilizers; <br>
      - at 00h46 he saw water penetrating the right side of the bow ramp and thought 
      it was rain water, did not report it to anybody; <br>
      - when Margus Treu returned to the ECR he went to the workshop next to the 
      ECR and on same deck, and did some work; <br>
      - suddenly the vessel listed to starboard, he walked back to the ECR where 
      Treu was watching the monitor and said: "The situation is serious" or "bad" 
      "because the ramp has been struck and became broken."; <br>

        at 01h02 Kadak was in the ECR at 01h03 where Treu was watching the monitor 
        and said: "The situation is serious. The ramp has been struck and became 
        broken." This means that something must have struck the ramp before 01h03 
        to the effect that it became broken, which resulted in large water quantities 
        entering the cardeck which, together with the water quantity having accumulated 
        on the cardeck already during the past hours, caused the vessel to list 
        suddenly and rapidly to starboard. </font></p>

      via the ramp. At the same time he heard the watch AB report about water 
      on cardeck; <br>
      - ca. 01h20 the bridge asked whether it would be possible to create a list 
      to port, which it was not, because the port tank was full and the starboard 
      one empty; <br>
      - thereafter he established that the starboard list had already increased 
      by 1 degree and from that moment increased rapidly; <br>
      - at a list of 30-35° the 2 port main engines stopped; an attempt to restart 
      the engines failed;<br>
      - "We continued to make 5-6 knots." <br>
      - A moment later the 4th engine followed by the 3rd engine stopped also.

      - The bridge asked whether it would be possible to pump overboard freshwater,

      - Statement taken by the Security Police, Tallinn:<br>
      - was in the ECR, all 4 main engines were running and the vessel was making 
      a speed of ca. 14,5 kn; <br>
      - heard 2 hard blows one after the other which did not result from wave 
      impact; <br>
      - saw on the monitor after the noises that large quantities of water were 
      being pressed through at the sides of the ramp, at the ramp itself, or at 
      its sides there were no sealings. <br>
      - Before the noises he saw also AB Silver Linde on the monitor at about 
      01h00 or 5 minutes later; <br>
      - At the casualty none of the main engines were running at full revolutions 
      or full ahead. The mates are fixing the power output. <br>
      - The cardeck cannot be pumped out, but there were 12 scuppers at each side 
      leading the water outboard. <br>
      - On the cardeck the cars were unable to topple over because there was no 
      space. They could move against each other (forward/aft direction)..<br>
      - There were lots of cars. No empty space. At the sides there was ca. 20-25 
      cm space. <br>

        which could make sense in connection with the hydraulic noises heard by 
        Carl Övberg just before or at about 01h00 when Linde probably started 
        the hydraulic pump and tried to close the bow ramp and possible hold down 
        the visor hydraulically when he operated the handles wrongly and broke 
        the visor hinges (see observations of Carl Övberg). He also does not mention 
        the starboard list. <i><b>In any event he has made it quite clear that

    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Finally we shall discuss the testimony of <i><b>Valters 
      Kikuts </b></i><br>
      - a Latvian policeman having been in the port side stairway on Deck 7 between 
      the cabins of 1st Engineer Arvo Tulvik and 2nd Engineer Peeter Tüür. When 
      being questioned by the Finnish Police on 29.9.94 he stated as follows: 
      <br>
      - He and his friend selected the above explained location for their night 
      rest as they were deck-passengers; Kikuts had a Motorola Digital watch which 
      was on Latvian = Estonian = ship's time. <br>
      - They settled in the stairway before 23h30 as this is the first time he 
      mentioned when they observed that the vessel rolled heavily. <br>
      - At about<i><b> 00h00 </b></i>he looked through the front window and noted 
      severe heaving movements of the bow which resulted in sea/bow being sometimes 
      on the same level. Then a lot of water gushed onto the forecastle deck. 
      The waves became heavier and more water appeared to come onto the forecastle 
      deck. He also explained that he saw a big search light spreading light ca. 
      10 m in front of the bow. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Note: </i></b>As there was no search light on top 
        of the visor one or both ice search lights on top of the bridge wings 
        were probably switched on and focused in an area before the bow. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"> - He stated to have looked at his watch the last time at 
      00h28 and thereafter secured the watch under the band of his trousers, apparently 
      because he had seen just before viz. at about 00h26 that a considerable 
      part of the bow had been bouncing up whereafter that part rose and sank. 
      An athwartships gap opened/closed through which water was splashing up, 
      possibly strongest at starboard side. The vessel went straight against wind 
      and sea at that moment. At the same time the search light went out and the 
      engine sound could not be heard anymore. After water had cascaded from the 
      gap the bow appeared to sink below the water surface. At that time Kikuts 
      and his friend decided to go to the open deck. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Note: </i></b>Based on Kikuts's testimony it has 
        to be assumed that the whole matter took only some minutes, i.e. from 
        the moment the bow bounced up with the athwartships gap opening/closing 
        a couple of times and water cascading out/surging in and finally the visor 
        disappearing below water. Although he does not mention the starboard list 
        at the early stage it has to be assumed that the 2 left for the open deck 
        when the vessel took the abrupt starboard list at 01h02. If that should 
        have been so the visor hinges broke around 00h55 which fits in well with 
        observations/noises heard by other passengers. Also Kikuts's observation 
        that wind/sea came from straight ahead, although the vessel should have 
        been on 287° and have wind and sea from 5-6 points on the port bow and 
        further that he felt the engine no longer fits in very well with the observations 
        of other passengers, i.e. the vessel was slowly turning to port with reduced 
        speed. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"> - Kikuts further testified that he had been one of the 
      last ones to drive onboard the ferry, thus his car was close to the bow 
      ramp, but that he was the last time on cardeck at 18h30 (should probably 
      be 19h30 as the last cars drove onboard around 19h00). His car was not secured 
      (he stated that to be normal having already made ca. 30 trips with "Estonia") 
      and also the heavy trucks just had wedges in front of the tires. </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Note:</i></b> The statement of Kikuts would also 
        be timewise approximately in agreement with other relevant statements 
        if he would have observed the visor bouncing open at about 00h56 instead 
        of 00h26. He has given a statement to us last July with some drawings 
        attached which is enclosed as enclosure No. 3. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><font size="2">Final Statement </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">When the survivors were questioned by the police they were 
      also asked what was the cause of the catastrophe. Most of them have not 
      answered this question, some have said it was the water on the cardeck which 
      is certainly right, but how did it get onto the cardeck? Below are extracts 
      of some statements with certain indications, partly being hearsay evidence: 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>(a) Ainus Toobal </i></b>- Estonian truck driver: 
      "As to the cause of the accident I can say that at the vessel's forepart 
      where the cars are driving in water had started to rush in." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i><b>(b) Eckard Klug</b></i> - Swedish truck driver: In 
      his opinion the unsecured cars and trucks had moved forward against the 
      bow ramp due to the hard setting in of vessel's bow and forced the bow ramp 
      open, and this is the cause of the casualty. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i><b>(c) Paula Liikamaa </b></i>- Croupier in the board 
      casino: "Whilst in the hospital she overheard a conversation between a crew 
      member from the "Estonia", who was also watchman on "Estonia", speaking 
      to another person whom she could not identify. They were speaking in Estonian 
      to each other. "The watchman, whose first name is Ervin and surname is Rhoden 
      (Note: It is the security officer Ervin Rhoden), said that he had switched 
      on his walkie-talkie when he was in his cabin and heard another watchman 
      - Silver Linde - say over his walkie-talkie that he was on the cardeck, 
      that is, at least, what Paula understood. Silver Linde had said further 
      that there was a lot water on the cardeck and that they must leave the vessel." 
      That according to Paula is the contents of the conversation between Ervin 
      Rhoden and the unknown man in Södersjukhuset." <br>
      <i><b>Note:</b></i> The statement of Ervin Rhoden mentions absolutely nothing 
      about the above which must have been before 01h02 the moment of the sudden 
      list, whereafter everybody was just trying to survive. It is unknown to 
      us and not reflected in our documentation whether Ervin Rhoden was ever 
      confronted with this statement. According to our documentation the Swedish 
      / Finnish Commission members did not talk to him at all so far. </font></p>
    <p><b><i><font size="2">Alti Hakanpää </font></i></b><font size="2">- passenger 
      -<br>
      - Speaks and understands the Estonian language.<br>
      - Was rescued by the "Mariella" and spoke onboard with an Estonian crew 
      member: The contents of this conversation was protocolled by the Swedish 
      Police as follows: "Hakanpää got the impression that the man was working 
      on the cardeck. The man reported that he had been on the cardeck before 
      the vessel took the list. At that time there had been ca. 50 cm high water 
      on the cardeck. The man did not report any more details about the cardeck. 
      He told him in addition that they had personnel onboard trained for employment 
      lateron on "Diana II"." Note: As Silver Lilnde was not rescued by "Mariella" 
      this crew member having worked on the cardeck before the list started must 
      have been either Aulis Lee or Aarne Koppel. Also here we do not know whether 
      the police and/or the Commission followed up this important statement. Hakanpää 
      has told journalists what else he heard from the discussions between the 
      Estonian crew members first on the liferaft and subsequently onboard of 
      "Mariella" when they had not yet realized that he understood their language. 
      This, however, is not part of this summary and is being dealt with elsewhere 
      in our report. </font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Conclusion</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2"> Based on the above summarised and partly commented statements 
      of relevant passengers and crew members it has to be concluded that the 
      "Sequence of Events" must have been somewhat different from what the International 
      Commission has so far submitted and also what the authors Anders Hellberg 
      and Anders Jörle assume in their book "Katastrofen Kurs". This can only 
      be explained by the apparent fact that neither the Commission nor the authors 
      have - so far - carefully scrutinised the passengers' statements which - 
      in combination with the statements of the crew members from the engine department 
      - do explain what and when it happened.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> The detailed evaluation of the testimony available to us 
      indicates that</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(a) there was water on the cardeck well before the casualty 
      sequence-of-events commenced; <br>
      (b) there were certain quantities of water on the 1st Deck, i.e. deck below 
      cardeck, in particular in the forward part, already before the sudden starboard 
      list started; <br>
      (c) the vessel's trim had changed since the departure from Tallinn from 
      down by the stern to down by the bow because of the full visor, and the 
      water having entered the cardeck via the damaged bow ramp and other openings; 
      <br>
      (d) there had been severe crash noises on the cardeck at approximately 00h45/00h50 
      and probably the bow ramp was smashed open from the inside of the cardeck, 
      but was prevented from falling into the visor by its hydraulic cylinders 
      resisting the opening movements, however, the water quantities streaming 
      onto the cardeck from the full inside of the visor rapidly increased; <br>
      (e) this was apparently reported to those on the bridge by Silver Linde 
      and the speed was reduced and the bow turned into the wind/sea, i.e. to 
      port, the starboard list increased slightly simultaneously Silver Linde 
      was instructed to close the bow ramp hydraulically; <br>
      (f) After having started the hydraulic pumps, he may have mixed up the handles 
      on the panel and activated the actuator of the visor which broke at first 
      the much weakened hinges at starboard and subsequently the port ones, followed 
      by the side locks, whilst the Atlantic lock remained intact for the time 
      being; <br>
      (g) the visor was then moving forward/aft between the hinge plates at vessel's 
      side and the deck beam at frame 159 which created the noises compared by 
      many passengers and crew to a sledge-hammer beating against the hull, the 
      gap on forecastle deck as well as at both sides opened and closed and the 
      water penetration into visor and, consequently, also through the partly 
      open bow ramp onto the cardeck increased substantially; <br>
      (h) the vessel took a sudden and considerable starboard list at 01h02 which 
      after ca. 2 minutes was already 20°: which required 800 ts water on the 
      cardeck, the list increased further. <br>
      (j) the vessel continued to turn to port, but more rapidly because with 
      the increasing starboard list the still active starboard stabilizer fin 
      took over the function of a rudder blade and made the vessel turn to port 
      (fin is down to counter the starboard listing) rather quickly whilst the 
      rudder blades, although being at hard astarboard, had little or no effect 
      due to the list compared to the stabilizer fin, list had exceeded 30° at 
      about 01h10 and the main engines stopped;<br>
      (k) the visor broke off and the ramp was totally open at about 01h15 when 
      the list was in excess of 40°, auxiliaries stopped and the emergency generator 
      started, the stabilizer fins stopped moving up and down;<br>
      (l) the vessel, stabilized at a list of between 40°-50°, was then already 
      heading approximately SE, i.e. the funnel pointing in the direction where 
      the wind came from; <br>
      (m) the vessel was on her side at 01h31 when also the emergency generator 
      stopped. <br>
      (n) It has to be assumed that the visor separated from the vessel at about 
      01h15 (was probably seen by Margus Treu on the monitor) and that the Atlantic 
      lock broke shortly before as is demonstrated by the bending to of the visor 
      lug to starboard. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In summary of the 75 pages before it has to be concluded 
      that<i><b> the primary cause of the casualty</b></i> is the</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> a.) water filled visor in combination with the damaged/leaking 
      bow ramp which - under the prevailing circumstances and by the impossibility 
      to adjust any starboard list as the port ballast tanks were already full 
      upon sailing - led to a slowly flooding of parts of the cardeck including 
      down flooding into 1st Deck and <br>
      b.) that the extremely hard setting-in of vessel's bow into short high seas 
      from port ahead created by the vessel proceeding under the circumstances 
      at too high speed caused improper and/or not at all secured cars to crash 
      against the bow ramp - also being improperly secured - which became pushed 
      open allowing even larger quantities of water to enter the cardeck.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"> The subsequent attempt by crew members to close the ramp 
      and to hold down the visor hydraulically failed totally and led to breaking 
      of the visor hinges <br>
      - by its extremely weak condition due gross negligent repair attempts <br>
      - which further increased the water ingress through the partly open bow 
      ramp and led to a sudden 20° starboard list. Due to the continuously streaming-in 
      of water through the partly open bow ramp <br>
      - the vessel was meanwhile on a south-easterly heading due to the rudder 
      effect of the starboard stabilzer fin with her deep starboard side now exposed 
      fully to wind/sea<br>
      - the list increased until the vessel stabilized for some time at between 
      40°-50°, and thereafter quickly listed to 90°. The visor separated from 
      the vessel probably at about 01h15 and the bow ramp was fully open for some 
      time which certainly increased the water ingress onto cardeck even more, 
      however, at that time the vessel had a list of ca. 40° already with all 
      4 main engines shut-off and lying with the deep starboard side exposed to 
      the heavy beam seas, thus being in a hopeless condition with capsizing/sinking 
      being just a question of minutes. </font></p>
