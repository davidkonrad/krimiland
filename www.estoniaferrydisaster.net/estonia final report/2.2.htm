  'The General Scandinavian Practice' </font></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 'Group of Experts' 
    has also looked into the origin of the so-called 'General Scandinavian Practice' 
    which is meant to be the attitude of the Scandinavian National Maritime Administrations, 
    in particular of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and the Finnish Sjöfartsstyrelsen 
    respectively the Finnish Board of Navigation (F.B.N.), in respect of the interpretation 
    of and the dealing with certain SOLAS Rules. This refers, in particular, to 
    the location of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck, which on the car/passenger ferries is the car deck. This is regulated 
    by SOLAS 1974, Chapter II-1, Rule 9 (1979 Edition) and exemptions are only 
    possible according to Rule 1 (c) if the route of the vessel does not lead 
    more than 20 nm from the nearest land. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the early years 
    of the Ro-Ro ferries, i.e. end of the 1950's/beginning of the 1960's, the 
    ferries were rather small and sailed only short distances and hence were never 
    more than 20 nm off the nearest land. In this time the maritime administrations 
    accepted the bow ramp in combination with the front bulkheads as the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, no matter where they 
    were located.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In searching for 
    the origin of the authorities' attitude it was found that apparently for the 
    first time on the ferries PRINS BERTIL and PRINSESSAN CHRISTINA, built in 
    Aarhus in 1960/61, the bow ramps had been accepted as the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck by the National Maritime Authorities, 
    most probably with the restriction not to proceed more than 20 nm from the 
    nearest land. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, it has 
    to be noted that at least Sjöfartsverket and F.B.N. took the view already 
    in 1959 that all structural matters - including the position of the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead - would have to be dealt with by the Classification 
    Societies, no matter whether SOLAS requirements, which actually were the responsibility 
    of the Maritime Administrations, were involved or not. This attitude is revealed 
    in a letter dated 07.04.59 written by the then Kungl. Sjöfartsstyrelsen now 
    Sjöfartsverket (attached as Enclosure 2.2.3) and in a statement which H. Valkonen 
    of the F.B.N. gave at a meeting with this 'Group of Experts' on 27.10.95 (Memo 
    attached as Enclosure 2.2.4). In other words, as soon as the Classification 
    Society had issued the Class Certificates the National Maritime Administration 
    issued the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, thereby confirming that the 
    ferry complied with SOLAS, although they did not know this for sure but merely 
    assumed that the Classification Society had checked the compliance of the 
    relevant vessel with SOLAS. This actually was the case only after the Classification 
    Societies had incorporated SOLAS 1974 into their Rules, which, however, was 
    not done simultaneously by all of them; for example Det norske Veritas (DnV) 
    did it quite early while Bureau Veritas did it quite late. As most of the 
    Swedish and Finnish ferries were classified by DnV, both Sjöfartsverket and 
    F.B.N. were accustomed to having the Classification Societies take care of 
    the structural SOLAS requirements. Bureau Veritas, however, incorporated SOLAS 
    1974 into its Rules only in 1981, i.e. after DIANA II and VIKING SALLY had 
    been built as will be explained in the subsequent chapters, and thus did not 
    feel responsible for SOLAS matters during this time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of 
    the investigation it was also discovered that the F.B.N. had issued an 'Exemption 
    Certificate' to VIKING SALLY for a deviation from the SOLAS requirements in 
    respect of the lifesaving appliances, however not for the wrongly placed upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead, being the bow ramp on this as well as 
    on most of the car/passenger ferries trading in the Baltic in those years. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Revealing in this 
    context is the correspondence in 1981 between a Swedish ferry operator, being 
    in the process of taking over a foreign flag ferry, subsequently renamed KRONPRINSESSAN 
    VICTORIA, and Sjöfartsverket wherefrom the following is quoted:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) Owners to Sjöfartsverket:<br>
    <i>«With reference to the previous exchange of communication we have noted 
    that the bow ramp of this vessel is placed different than required by SOLAS 
    1974. We are requesting you to check this and reply by return whether the 
    location of the ramp is wrong.»</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) Reply by Sjöfartsverket 
    to owners:<br>
    <i>«The location of the inner bow ramp is in conformity with the national 
    as well as international practice and is accepted by us in the present condition. 
    <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    vessel has the required Swedish and international certificate which is also 
    accepted by Denmark and West Germany, whilst Sweden in the same manner is 
    also accepting the certificates of these countries. It is not the intention 
    of Sjöfartsverket to take up these questions with the Maritime Administrations 
    of said countries.»</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Copies of the respective 
    telex exchange can be found as Supplement 215 to the Final Report of the JAIC. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has 
    to be assumed that in the course of the years and with ever growing ferries 
    three alternatives concerning the bow ramp/upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead issue developed, viz.:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a) The bow ramp 
    is the upper extension and is located in accordance with SOLAS requirements 
    (the ferry could sail outside 20 nm range without restrictions). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b) The bow ramp is 
    not the upper extension, but at the location on the car deck, as required 
    by SOLAS, a "partial collision door" is installed (also this ferry could sail 
    without restrictions). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c) The bow ramp (in 
    combination with the front bulkheads) is the upper extension, but is not located 
    at the proper place as required by SOLAS and no "partial collision door" is 
    installed. (This ferry could sail inside the 20 nm range, but the National 
    Maritime Administration would have to issue an 'Exemption Certificate' which 
    would have to be renewed annually together with the PSSC.) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to a)<br>
    This version complies fully with SOLAS and from this point of view creates 
    no problems, however, the commercial side is treated badly because in order 
    to take as many cars on the car deck as possible the bow ramp has to be as 
    far forward as possible and this leads over to either version b.) or version 
    c.).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> as to b)<br>
    This version was already being built into ferries at the end of the 1970's 
    operating in the Irish Sea, North Sea and the English Channel (although not 
    on all of them). It complies fully with the respective SOLAS requirements. 
    This version was also part of the initial quotations/specifications for DIANA 
    II and VIKING SALLY submitted by Meyer Werft to the respective owners, whereafter 
    - after consultations with Sjöfartsverket - respectively F.B.N. - the "partial 
    collision doors" were deleted. The result was version c.). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to c)<br>
    This version existed on DIANA II as well as on VIKING SALLY and on dozens 
    of other ferries in the Baltic and elsewhere. The acceptance of this configuration 
    by the National Maritime Administrations of Sweden and Finland, no matter 
    whether the ferries sailed inside or outside of the 20-nm range and without 
    issuing an Exemption Certificate to cover the wrong location of the upper 
    extension is understood to be the 'General Scandinavian Practice'. It was 
    followed for example by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket responsible for 
    the DIANA II when she was sailing between Trelleborg and Rostock, still in 
    1994 when the Manager - Åke Sjöblom - signed the PSSC thereby confirming that 
    she fully complied with SOLAS, which she did not, because her bow ramp (with 
    the front bulkheads) was the upper extension but as such located too much 
    forward. As she stayed within the 20-nm range in the course of her route the 
    simple issuance of an Exemption Certificate would have put the PSSC in compliance 
    with SOLAS, however, it was not issued. The same refers to VIKING SALLY and 
    SILJA STAR whereas the situation as to the WASA KING and ESTONIA was quite 
    different, as will be explained in subsequent chapters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this respect 
    it is remarkable to note that the predecessor of the ESTONIA in the Stockholm-Tallinn 
    service, the Swedish flag NORD ESTONIA, owned by Nordström & Thulin, the technical 
    managers and part-owners of the ESTONIA, had sailed between Stockholm and 
    Tallinn for about 2 years under the strict supervision of Sjöfartsverket without 
    having the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck at 
    the location required by SOLAS and without having a "partial collision door" 
    at the location required by SOLAS but with an unrestricted PSSC issued and 
    annually renewed by Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the light of 
    the explanations above it can be concluded that definitely in the years 1978/80 
    it corresponded to the state-of-the-art as well as to the 'rules of the art' 
    that on car/passenger ferries operating in the Baltic Sea not more than 20 
    nm from the nearest land the watertight-built bow ramps were accepted as upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck, and compliance with 
    the SOLAS requirements was assumed even without the issuance of an Exemption 
    Certificate. </font></p>
