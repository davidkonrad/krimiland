  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In the meantime some logbook 
    pages from the survey vessel "SUUNTA", the "HALLI" and the "TURSAS" have been 
    received, from which the following information has been abstracted:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) "SUUNTA" : <br>
    28.09.94 wind : 290°, 18 m/s - heavy weather preventing search work<br>
    29.09.94 wind : 280°, 11 m/s - 14 m/s - heavy swell preventing search for 
    wreck of "ESTONIA"</font></p>

    search for the wreck, 17.32 hrs. <br>
    located the wreck and dropped buoy on position<br>
    x = 6585590,0 = 59°22,92'N; <br>
    y = 1538902,0 = 21°41,06'E <br>
    18.45 hrs. left for Hangö.<br>
    Note: <br>
    This means that the correct position was known from the very beginning, but 
    even to Olof Forssberg Kari Lethola reported a wrong one. Apparently the correct 
    position was kept secret until the diving operation early December 1994. </font></p>

    to be from "HALLI", because these logbooks (except for SUUNTA's) do not carry

    to 20.45 hrs. in the presence of Karppinen and Aarnio from the JAIC. The 3

    Note: <br>
    Unfortunately the logbook pages for 10.10.94 were not submitted. The video 
    footage received from the JAIC in March<br>
    1995 does not include recordings made between 17.30 and 21.10 hrs. during 
    the 1st anchoring near the stern of the wreck. It only covers the recordings
