  INTRODUCTION </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In April 1995 the 
    JAIC published the <i>"PART-Report covering technical issues on the capsizing 
    on 28 September 1994 in the Baltic Sea of the ro-ro passenger vessel MV Estonia" 
    </i>which included also certain picture material, among others the picture 
    below showing the aft part of the visor bottom with the visor lug being part 
    of the Atlantic lock.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The blue coloured 
    part of the lug - see arrow - looked as if having been exposed to heat which 
    was unusual since this part had been below water. The JAIC was contacted and 
    it turned out that samples had been taken already on 25 November 1994 and 
    had been examined upon request of the Central Criminal Police in Finland and 
    Kari Lethola as chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC on 30.03.95. The 
    tests were carried out on 30.05.95 by the Criminal Laboratory Technical Division, 
    Helsinki. The "available" documentation was received - already translated 
    into English - from Kari Lethola.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These were: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) A request for 
      testing of 4 samples taken on 25.11.94 to find out whether there were traces 
      of explosives in the samples. The request was made in Swedish language on 
      a printed Swedish form by Kari Lethola. The document with translation is 
      attached as Enclosure 31.392.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The results

    is unclear what exactly should be tested. Presumably these were the parts 
    that were cut off from the visor around the openings where the lugs of the 
    hydraulic sidelocks had been since these are apparently the only parts cut 
    off soon after the recovery of the visor.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It 
    is obvious that such a surface test would result in nothing because the samples 
    had been under water for almost 7 weeks. Since the investigation of the TWA 
    800 crash it is public knowledge that explosives cannot be traced by means 
    of the methods applied by the laboratory when the objects have been under 
    water for more than one week. It would, even today and in 20 years time, be 
    possible to prove explosion damage by scientific methods by means of which 
    the destroyed molecular structure is examined. This, however, was not done 
    according to the available documents.</font></p>

  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the samples

    of colour. The white layer of paint that constituted the top layer on both 
    the paint samples seems to be intact and some rubbings of strange paint could 
    not be observed.<br>
    In sample No. 7 were paint splinters with paint layer structure that was different 
    from the bow mentioned because lots of grey and blue epox paint had been rubbed 
    on the top white paint layer. This epox paint was when it comes to the pigment 
    and the component type to its chemical structure of the same type as the Inerta 
    160 epox colour, that had been manufactured in the laboratory from the samples 
    8. and 9.« </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results are self-explanatory 
    and need no further comment.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These are the 
    only known activities in connection with explosives which were incurred by 
    the Authorities involved in the casualty investigation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No further information 
    relating to explosives having possibly been on board the ESTONIA on her last 
    voyage were received until approximately mid 1996 when rumours were circulating 
    that there was a big hole in the starboard side of the hull in way of sauna 
    and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck. The information came at first from 
    some source in the upper middle management of Sjöfartsverket. A check of the 
    available video material - see Chapters 25-28 - revealed that the respective 
    parts on all video tapes had been cut out - see Subchapter 34.6 - Disengage 
    Report. A review of the statements of the survivors from the 1st deck having 
    been rather close to the area in question did not allow definite conclusions 
    until it was possible to talk to one of them personally. This was Carl Övberg 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151</a> and Subchapter 12.4.2 - who explained among other things that 
    he saw water escaping under high pressure from the goose-necks fitted to two 
    ventilation pipes coming up from 0-deck. He made this observation about 1 
    minute after the 3rd and most most heavy shock, vibration of the vessel but 
    about 30 seconds before the big heel to starboard. This allows the conclusion 
    that at least the 0-deck compartment directly below Carl Övberg must have 
    been flooded and under pressure.This indicated a connection to the outside, 
    i.e. a hole in the hull, in way of 0-deck as otherwise the compartment could 
    not have been under pressure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This scenario was 
    among other things also presented at the first and second exhibition organised 
    by this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997 when the 
    complete investigation results were presented to the national and international 
    public and media. Among the many pieces of information received during these 
    exhibitions there were also explanations regarding possible explosions on 
    board.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a relatively 
    silent 1998 when most of the interested people were analysing and subsequently 
    criticising the report of the JAIC a new person appeared in Sweden apparently 
    with sufficient time, and an undisturbed mind, to analyse again all the publicly 
    available video footage and documentation on this subject collected by the 
    JAIC. He found among other things on the video B40b, made by the SPRINT ROV 
    on 03.12.94, a package on the port superstructure in way of the 5th deck which 
    appeared suspicious to him. Video images were made and shown among others 
    also to experts in explosives in Sweden and Germany. See the following image.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1099.jpg" width="345" height="248"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both identified the 
    package with about 90% certainty to be an explosive charge used underwater.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Evaluation 
    of the footage made by ROV on 02. and 09.10.94 revealed, however, that the 
    package had not been at the identified location on the 5th deck on these dates, 
    thus must have been placed there between the 09.10. and 03.12.94 and therefore 
    could not be casualty related.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    the term "explosives", which had always been in the background during the 
    preceding years of the investigation, was suddenly brought back to the attention 
    of the investigators and the video footage available in Hamburg, all obtained 
    from the JAIC, was analysed again also in an attempt to find possible explanations 
    for numerous so far unexplained damage areas. It revealed among other things 
    that an orange coloured cube had been attached to the recess of the port front 
    bulkhead of the wreck in way of the hydraulic and manual side locks and the 
    fastening of the bow ramp actuator. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cube was clearly 
    visible and had been closely looked at by the ROV during the inspection on 
    09.10.94, it could not, however, be found on the 02.10.94 videos which was 
    possibly due to restricted visibility and was definitely not in this location 
    on the SPRINT ROV made on 03.12.94 respectively on the diver video of the 
    same date.<br>
    Images were made from the orange coloured cube and identified by all three 
    experts from Sweden, England and Germany with a high degree of probability 
    as an<b> "explosive charge"</b>. See the following two images. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As this charge attached 
    in way of a very sensitive area - the port side locking devices of the visor 
    and the fastening of the port bow ramp actuator - obviously did not explode, 
    the corresponding area of the starboard side was analysed for possible explosion 
    damage which was positively identified by the underwater explosive expert 
    Brian Braidwood. This resulted in a further analysis of the available video 
    footage all received from the JAIC. The results are outlined in the following 
    subchapters. </font></p>
