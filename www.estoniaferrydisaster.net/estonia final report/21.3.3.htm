    third of this deck passenger cabins were arranged. In the middle was the large 
    Tax-Free Shop, the Boutiques were at starboard side as well as the Pub Admiral, 
    also called the Karaoke Bar. On port side there was the Arcade, with the Playroom 
    and in the aft part Café Neptunus. Considerable modifications had been carried 
    out on this deck in comparison to the newbuilding condition. The drawing attached

        directly or via the combinator. - See Subchapter 2.5.3 - In all probability 
        the engines and the pitch propellers were working in the combinator mode, 
        i.e. in case the speed was reduced from full to slow ahead the pitch and 
        the propeller revolutions were reduced simultaneously. Based on experience 
        a passenger in a cabin or in some restaurant could normally notice a pitch 
        change only by a change of vibration. If, for example, the pitch was reduced 
        to maintain a speed of 6 kn, the vibration level would more or less totally 
        disappear in the passenger cabin and the passenger had the impression 
        that the engines did stop.</font></p>

      of the casualty he had not been out on deck, but watched the sea state through 
      the windows, the speed of the "Estonia" was highly excessive under the circumstances, 
      as a matter of fact Pierre Thiger has never before or thereafter experienced 
      that a vessel was smashed so hard into heavy headseas, each time the bow 
      smashed into the sea, the vessel almost stopped, was shaking and vibrating 
      and then accelerated again until it smashed into the next wave and so on, 
      in addition to this very hard pitching, she was rolling, always more to 
      starboard than to port, because he remembers having to continuously hold 
      himself to the bar with one hand (for the last hour or so he was sitting 
      together with Altti Hakanpää in the Admiral's Pub on 5th deck) to avoid 
      his bar stool tilting over to starboard.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
      to his observations the sequence-of-events started <b>10-15 minutes before 
      midnight (Swedish time) </b>when he heard 3 bangs with 15-20 seconds in 
      between, metal to metal and thought it was a collision, the ship was shaking 
      and vibrating differently than before, shortly afterwards he noted that 
      she was pitching more, but made much slower and deeper movements, there 
      were no more bangs but suddenly he felt vibrations in the aft ship which 
      made him think that they had turned the stern into the sea and the pitch 
      was on astern, he could not see anything out of the window, he felt the 
      vibrations from the propeller (glasses were clinking) and then he heard 
      the strange noise: A very low noise and simultaneously the pitch movements 
      stopped as if a wave had struck under the stern, then all vibrations stopped 
      and in the same second she continued to pitch again, however, without any 
      engine noise, for about one minute she was only pitching, then pitching 
      and rolling, and then only rolling - she made two full swings - more to 
      starboard, less to port, and the third time she heeled over deep to starboard, 
      did not right up again and then fell abruptly to about 40°/45°, this was 
      just before midnight (Swedish time), she came back to almost upright position 
      and then heeled to about 10°/15° and further heeled to about 40°/45° when 
      she stabilised herself for at least 10 probably 12 minutes, whereafter she 
      continued to heel from 45° to 90° relatively quickly before she was fully 
      on the side, the funnel smashed a couple of times on the waves;<br>
      when he had reached the outside of the 7th deck, the list was about 40°, 
      wind and sea were coming abeam from starboard and at port side, 5-6 points 
      aft of abeam there were lights, after they had been on deck for sometime 
      already and the<b> list had slowly increased to about 45°, the lights went 
      out, but immediately thereafter came back, all this was within the ca. 10-12 
      minute phase, when the ferry had stabilised herself at a heel of 40°-45°.</b><br>
      He was subsequently picked-up by SILJA SYMPHONY and came ashore at Helsinki,

      the protocol. In Stockholm he was subsequently questioned again by the Swedish

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The conference 
    began only at 17.00 hours Swedish time (ST) and the room was at the starboard 
    side aft.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He had to give 
    a speech and simultaneously show 7-8 overheads. At some time, when he was 
    still showing overheads, a high whining noise started which apparently came 
    somewhere from below. It was loud but constant at the beginning and he just 
    had to speak in a louder voice.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He thinks that 
    they had another break after his presentation when the conference hostess 
    was asked to have the machine or pump, creating the disturbing noises, turned 
    off, however, she came back stating that nothing could be done about it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The noise changed 
    to on/off, which was even more disturbing and we closed down the conference 
    about 15-20 minutes earlier than planned, i.e. at 20.40/20.45 hours ST. This 
    means that the noise did presumably start at about 20.30 hours ST.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner at restaurant 
    "SEASIDE" on deck 6, starboard side, was ordered for 21.00 hours ST, but they 
    had to wait some 5-10 minutes before their tables were ready.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Dinner took probably 
    11/2 hours and the time was then about 22.30/22.40 hours ST. He still heard 
    the "noise" in the distance. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After having walked 
    around for some time he met four ladies of his group and they went up to deck 
    7, port side where the door to the outside was slamming open/closed and the 
    carpet was soaking wet up to the stairs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thereafter they 
    decided to visit the Admiral's Pub which they entered probably 23.40/23.45 
    hours ST. Also here he heard the "noise".</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Shortly afterwards 
    Sörman felt the change in the vessel's movements because she was now pitching 
    softly and started to roll more. It was much more comfortable then the very 
    hard pitching before and he hoped it would remain like this for the rest of 
    the night.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After a while near 
    the stage he walked to a sofa in the starboard forward corner. It was then 
    that he felt 2-3 shocks in his feet. These were like blows in the forward/aft 
    direction, somehow like pitching, but different.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The girls sat on 
    the sofa and he sat on a chair and they continued their discussion when Anita 
    suddenly rose saying she would go to her cabin now. They tried in vain to 
    persuade her to stay and Sörman looked at his watch. It was 23.55 hours ST.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They continued 
    to discuss a particular course when suddenly the vessel heeled very slowly, 
    but much deeper to starboard. She heeled so far over that they could see water 
    splashing against the windows next to them. Behind the bar all the glasses 
    hanging underneath the ceiling fell on top of the bar lady.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel came 
    back to more or less upright condition, maybe even a bit to port, but subsequently 
    heeled again and even deeper to starboard. This time all the tables, chairs 
    and whatever else was not solidly fixed rushed to the starboard side.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The saw again water 
    on the window but the vessel came back again to almost upright condition and 
    they took the chance and rushed to the exit which they managed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was then that 
    he realised that there were no more engine noises, but the lights were on. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel heeled 
    again to starboard, now stepwise with stable periods in between. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They rushed up 
    to deck 6 and further to deck 7 where they reached the aft door and managed 
    to get out to the open deck with difficulties.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> They could still 
    walk on the deck, the heel was then probably 30°. </font></li>
