  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The Estonian 
    flag car/passenger ferry ESTONIA - pictured below - departed from Tallinn 
    on 27 September 1994 at about 19.15* to 19.30 hours for a scheduled voyage 
    to Stockholm. Reportedly she was carrying 989 people - 803 passengers and 
    186 crew members - as well as 40 trucks/trailers, 25 passenger cars, 9 vans 
    and 2 buses. Despite the completely filled port heeling tank she had a 1° 
    starboard list at departure.</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">MV ESTONIA left Tallinn 
    with all four main engines running. When she was clear of the breakwater full 
    service speed was set. The four engines were hence set to produce 90% of their 
    maximum continuous rating of 17,600 kW, corresponding to a speed of 19.5-20.0 
    kn. The wind was southerly 8-10 m/s. Visibility was good, with occasional 
    rain showers. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 20.00 hours the 
    watch on the bridge was taken over by the second officer Peeter Kannussaar 
    and the third officer Andres Tammes. The voyage proceeded normally. Sea conditions 
    along the Estonian coast were moderate, but became more rough when the ship 
    left the sheltered waters. The ferry was now heeling between 2°- 4° to starboard 
    due to increasing wind pressure on the port side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the voyage continued 
    the wind velocity increased gradually and the wind veered to south-west. Visibility 
    was generally more than 10 nautical miles. At midnight the wind had increased 
    to south-westerly 15-20 m/s with a corresponding increase of the wave height 
    to now 3-4 m significant. The rolling and pitching of the vessel increased 
    substantially. Many passengers became seasick, but everybody on board felt 
    the extremely hard pitching which caused the ferry to shake and vibrate as 
    she was driven through the rough sea with full power. Low banging noises from 
    the bow area were continuously heard by many passengers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">ESTONIA followed 
    her normal route along the Estonian North coast on course 262° to a waypoint 
    of 59°20' N; 22°00' E which is confirmed by the observations of survivor Anders 
    Ericson, the watch mate of the meeting vessel AMBER and the trainee mate Einar 
    Kukk having been on the bridge until ca. 00.35 hours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the waypoint, 
    at about 00.30 hours, the bridge ordered the engine room to activate the stabiliser 
    fins, however, there were again problems with the starboard fin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 00.45/50 
    hours one or two crashes/dull bangs were heard from the forward part of the 
    car deck whereafter very hard metallic banging noises were heard and felt 
    in the forepart of the ferry. Shortly afterwards it was felt that the speed 
    had been reduced and the vessel was now making much softer pitch movements 
    and also started to roll, less to port and more to starboard. Noises of the 
    racing propellers were heard and respective vibrations felt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time 
    a first - weak - "Mayday" call from ESTONIA was heard by those on the bridge 
    of a Swedish ferry in the vicinity, however, no action was initiated since 
    the call apparently was not repeated. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At about 01.00 hours 
    a sharp bang was heard and a slight shock felt, the vessel's hull vibrated. 
    Passengers from the 1st deck started to rush upwards, others were alarmed. 
    Water was noted escaping under pressure from 0-deck to 1st deck. A little 
    later, the second and much heavier impact followed by the third one occurred. 
    The vessel stopped abruptly while turning to port. At 01.02 hours the ferry 
    heeled - very wide - probably 50° or more - to starboard and came back to 
    almost upright condition whereafter she heeled again very wide to starboard 
    and came back to about 10° starboard but then heeled in steps to starboard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was now 
    on a south-easterly heading with wind and sea from starboard abeam within 
    a very short time and all 4 main engines were automatically shut off, while 
    the auxiliary diesels kept running/generating electricity some time longer. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Passengers started 
    to rush up the staircases and panic developed in many places. Many passengers 
    were apparently trapped in their cabins where they were later found by the 
    divers. Lifejackets were distributed to those passengers who managed to reach 
    the boat deck. They jumped or were washed into the sea. Some managed to climb 
    into liferafts which had been released from the vessel. Reportedly only the 
    starboard lifeboats were launched but could not be used except for the emergency 
    motor boat No. 1 which was later seen by some survivors proceeding away from 
    those in the water. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a heel of approximately 
    40° the diesel generators also automatically shut off and the emergency generator 
    took over the power supply to a limited number of consumers including illumination 
    of alleyways and decks, when a weak female voice was heard calling "Häire, 
    häire, laevel on häire" the Estonian words for "Alarm, alarm, there is alarm 
    on the ship" over the public address system. Just a moment later the internal 
    alarm code for the crew - "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" meaning "Go to fire 
    stations No. 1 and No. 2" - was transmitted over the public address system 
    followed by the general lifeboat alarm. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first officially 
    registered Mayday call from MV ESTONIA was received at 01.22 hours. A second 
    Mayday call was transmitted shortly afterwards and by 01.24 hours fourteen 
    ship- and shore-based radio stations, including the Maritime Rescue Coordination 
    Centre (MRCC) in Turku, had received respectively automatically recorded the 
    Mayday message. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The heeling to starboard 
    increased stepwise further and water continued to enter the accommodation 
    decks and the car deck through the partly open bow ramp and the starboard 
    stern ramp with increasing speed. The starboard side of the ship was submerged 
    at about 01.30 hours, with the visor still attached to bow ramp and forepeak 
    deck. During the final stage of flooding the ferry was completely upside down. 
    The visor fell off the ferry at a heel of approximately 130°/140° while the 
    ship sank stern first and disappeared from the radar screens of ships in the 
    area at about 01.53 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Rescue efforts were 
    initiated by the ferries in the vicinity while MRCC Turku reacted only rather 
    late. About one hour after ESTONIA had sunk, the first of the four passenger 
    ferries in the vicinity - M.V. MARIELLA - arrived on the scene of the casualty. 
    Rescue helicopters were activated and the first one arrived at 03.05 hours. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the night 
    and early morning, helicopters and assisting ships rescued the official number 
    of 138 people, of whom one later died in hospital. During the day and on the 
    two following days 92 bodies were recovered, thus it has to be assumed that 
    most of the missing persons are still inside the wreck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The wreck was found 
    in international waters within Finland's Search and Rescue Area, resting on 
    the seabed at a water depth of about 80 m on a heading of 95° and with a starboard 
    list of about 120°. The visor was missing and the bow ramp as well as the 
    starboard stern ramp were found to be slightly open. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The position of the 
    wreck was established to be 59°22,9' N, 21°41,9' E, while the visor was allegedly 
    found on position 59°23,0' N, 21°39,4' E, i.e. about 1500 m to the West of 
    the wreck. </font></p>
