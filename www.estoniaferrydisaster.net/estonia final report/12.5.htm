    Damage and Repairs</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Generally the information 
    available from on board is restricted to the observations of passengers as 
    basically reported in Chapter 12.4, because the crew members had been forbidden 
    by their employer ESCO to talk about ESTONIA at all. Only very few have talked, 
    although very carefully, as will be explained on the following pages.</font><br>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has also been very 
    difficult to obtain information from N&T/Hornet AB/ Estline or ESCO. Apart 
    from the discussion with Ulf Hobro during the first meeting with the JAIC 
    in Stockholm in February 1995, there are only some details available from 
    the files of the public prosecutor and from those of the JAIC, which will 
    also be discussed subsequently. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>1. Maintenance</b> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was drydocked 
    at Turku between<b> 4-8 January 1993</b> and the necessary inspections were 
    carried out. At this time also some maintenance work was performed which had 
    been partly ordered by the old owners, Wasa Line, and partly by the technical 
    managers of the new owners, N&T, as outlined in detail in Subchapter 6.5.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently in 
    January 1993 during the time at the yard:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>a)</b> the locking 
    devices of visor and bow ramp were neither serviced nor strengthened, and 
    <br>
    <b>b)</b> the outer hinges of the bow ramp were not serviced nor were the 
    bushings and bolts renewed, and<br>
    <b>c)</b> 15 m of the rubber packings of the visor and 10 m of the rubber 
    packings of the bow ramp were not renewed. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (a):<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the 
    crew was unable to service and strengthen <b>the locking devices of visor 
    and bow ramp</b>, they were never serviced and strengthened until the casualty. 
    Since the crew was also unable to service the hinges of the bow ramp and to 
    renew the bushings and bolts, in particular the port outer hinge, it is a 
    fact that nothing was done to rectify the poor condition of - at least - the 
    port outer bow ramp hinge. It is, however, known from Börje Stenström, head 
    of the technical group of JAIC, that the crew had put the damaged port outer 
    bow ramp hinge on the repair list a number of times, but that repairs were 
    postponed by the technical managers until the next scheduled yard stay, probably 
    in January 1995. The respective memo is attached as Enclosure 12.5.166. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (b): </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>visor 
    hinges </b>required professional maintenance which the crew was apparently 
    also unable to provide, because according to the testimony of the 2nd engineer 
    Peeter Tüür in June 1996, who is responsible for the technical functioning 
    of visor and bow ramp - the crew had problems to have the hinges properly 
    greased and even had <b>to add oil to the grease to ensure that the grease 
    reached all parts to be lubricated </b>- see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.167.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.167</a>. Needless to say that the effect of grease is destroyed by adding 
    oil. Due to the severely misaligned visor the hinges could no more be properly 
    lubricated. This resulted in excessive wear of the bronze bushings which consequently 
    had to be renewed.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Such renewal 
    is normally effected by drilling out the steel and bronze bushing by means 
    of a particular milling installation in order to avoid damage to the hinge 
    plates, which would be created if the bushings would be burned out. Whereas 
    drilling, including proper welding of new bushings, takes about 2 days in 
    port - whilst the visor is detached from the vessel and the vessel thus has 
    to be taken out of service - burning is much faster, however, is combined 
    with a loss of material of the hinge plates, the creating of deep burning 
    marks, each of which is a crack starter. It is obvious that such damage to 
    the hinge plates reduced their weight carrying capacity and furthermore increased 
    the propagation of fatigue cracks in the hinge plates. For further details 
    see Subchapter 34.3. Although denied by the technical managers and crew, the 
    steel bushings of both visor hinges were evidently burned out and replaced 
    by new steel and bronze bushings which, however, were fitted in a very unprofessional 
    way. This will be further explained in Subchapter 34.3. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>As to (c):</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On one hand 
    the responsible inspector in the organisation of the technical managers, N&T, 
    Ulf Hobro, stated before the JAIC on 17 February 1995:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»... we did 
      not care for the rubber packings, we have never renewed any of them nor 
      was it ever our intention to do so. The visor was full of water at sea and 
      this was known to everybody.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, 
    Lennart Klevberg, in charge of spare parts with N&T, did testify to the criminal 
    police Stockholm, that </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»rubber packings 
      for the visor had been ordered but were not installed because Capt. Andresson 
      and Tomas Rasmusson had decided to wait until MARE BALTICUM would be taken 
      over in order to do the replacement on both ferries simultaneously.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This does not make 
    much sense, however, based on the underwater videos it is indeed a fact that 
    the rubber packings of the visor were missing from forward of the Atlantic 
    lock along the whole port side and about 1 m up the front bulkhead, whilst 
    at the starboard side there were some rubber packings from forward of the 
    Atlantic lock to the "corner of the mouth", which was empty up to ca. 2 m 
    of the front bulkhead. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious 
    that the visor was no more weathertight and thus full of water at sea up to 
    the outboard level as evident from the watermarks inside of the visor.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>2. Damage and 
    Repairs</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The crew also denied 
    ever having carried out repairs to the visor, the bow ramp and/or to their 
    locking devices. This is true as far as the major repairs are concerned which 
    would have been necessary to bring the visor back into proper shape and alignment, 
    but which were never carried out. The crew, however, is wrong as far as numerous 
    smaller repairs and rectifications to the visor, the bow ramp and their locking 
    devices are concerned which were frequently performed to avoid the worst and 
    keep visor and bow ramp best terms possible in workable condition. This had 
    been observed by many passengers as outlined in Chapter 12.4. and was even 
    admitted by crew members, for example by the safety officer Ervin Roden who 
    told Spiegel TV on 02.05.97, among other things:<i> "Something was always 
    being repaired on board. There was always welding work being carried out. 
    I am uncertain whether also to the visor. But everywhere repairs were carried 
    out, also in the area of visor and bow ramp and also by the Finns."</i> The 
    complete interview is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.168.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.168. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apart from 
    the damages existing already when the ferry was taken over from the previous 
    owners and which were not repaired by the new owners/ managers, it is quite 
    obvious that the ferry sustained more damage to the visor and consequently 
    also to its fixing points, the hinges and locking devices, when for example 
    forcing ice at excessive speed as observed by various passengers. The observation 
    repeated below is just one example: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»<b>Observation 
      by Henning Frederiksson on 24.03.94:</b><i> It was stormy weather and "Estonia" 
      was proceeding in open water at full speed with a following sea when she 
      met pack ice, into which she crashed without any speed reduction. "Estonia" 
      came fast into the pack ice with an enormous crash and had to go backwards 
      and try again. There was 16 m/sec. storm, nevertheless, "Estonia" kept her 
      high speed.«</i></font></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg299.jpg" width="515" height="337"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of such 
    reckless navigation are clearly visible on the large photo on the previous 
    page which was taken on the following day, 25 March 1994, in Tallinn by the 
    professional photographer Li Samuelson.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ice damage 
    sustained by the visor during the months of February and March 1994, when 
    the Gulf of Finland and the Northern and Middle Baltic where more or less 
    continuously covered by ice (see Subchapter 12.4.2), were roughly repaired 
    by replacing parts of shell plating and bottom of the visor in Tallinn whilst 
    the vessel remained in service. The renewed parts are still visible on the 
    visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is also confirmed 
    by the observation of the passenger Christer Eriksson, who reported the following: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I travelled 
      to Tallinn on the "Estonia" on 3/4 May 1994 and left the vessel only at 
      about 10.30 hours when all the other passengers had already gone ashore. 
      The gangway was pulled in and I had to go ashore via the car deck and bow 
      ramp. When I came down on the car deck I noticed a curtain of sparks falling 
      down from the open visor on to the bow ramp and I managed to jump through 
      it and saw on the bow ramp a giant red transformer turned 90° towards the 
      ramp which in my opinion was Red Army surplus. Cables were running up to 
      the port side of the forecastle deck/visor, where obviously heavy burning/ 
      cutting work was in progress. When I returned from ashore at about 06.00 
      hours the workers were just collecting their tools, but the huge transformer 
      was still on the bow ramp.« </i></font></p>

    reflecting the above is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.169.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.6.169.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the 
    work explained above doubtlessly falls into the category "maintenance & repair" 
    and also could not be considered very minor, the repairs are not mentioned 
    in the <i>"List of Maintenance and Repair Works on M.V. 'Estonia', </i>April 
    1993 - August 1994" which is Supplement No. 230 to the Report of the JAIC. 
    Since also other visible repairs do not appear on this list, it has to be 
    assumed that the list is incomplete for obvious reasons. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also <b>Lars Gunnar 
    Nyström</b> informed the Swedish Commission that he had made many trips on 
    the ESTONIA. In February and March 1994 he was on board when ESTONIA was forcing 
    ice twice and arrived in Tallinn once with a delay of 1.5 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage 
    sustained by the visor while proceeding at full speed through ice barriers 
    several meters high and using the vessel as an ice breaker is demonstrated 
    by the preceding photo and can also be seen on the video image below made 
    from a film of 30.03.94.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a result of the 
    sustained severe structural damages and in combination with the different 
    lifting speeds of the actuators and severely worn out hinge bushings, the 
    visor became increasingly misaligned and out of geometry. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All of this 
    led to problems - observed and reported by passengers as described in Subchapter 
    12.4 - during the opening and closing which also affected the locking devices 
    and reportedly the problems became worse and took more time to be overcome 
    the nearer the day of ESTONIA's last departure came. This is demonstrated 
    by the following examples:</font></p>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Åke Eriksson</b> 
    - who travelled on the ESTONIA in September 1994 reported: Upon departure 
    from Stockholm the crew was unable to close the visor. Quite a number of crew 
    members were jumping around on the forecastle deck until they finally managed. 
    On departure from Tallinn, one week later, the departure was delayed by two 
    hours because the visor could not be closed.</font></li>

    together with a couple of others via Tallinn on the ESTONIA to Stockholm for 
    shopping. On the way back they had to wait for 3 hours in Tallinn before the 
    crew was able to open the visor, which was only possible after some burning/cutting 
    had taken place. They left the bus and went up to the 8th deck overlooking 
    the forecastle deck from where they observed what the crew and subsequently 
    also workers from ashore were doing. The respective letter from Paulomo is 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.170.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    pilot and now retired, had observed shortly before the casualty that after 
    departure from Frihamn Terminal the crew tried to close the visor for 15 minutes 
    by opening/closing with loud bangs until it became silent. The master explained 
    that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. The pilot asked the 
    master whether the locking devices would still fit and the answer was "no 
    problem". In the opinion of pilot Stenhammer the visor was 'out of geometry'.</font>

    1994 the crew was unable to open the visor in spite of all sorts of attempts. 
    Finally crew members brought two gas bottles plus burning gear to the door 
    in the starboard side house. The two gas bottles were on wheels and were left 
    in front of the door whilst the crew members pulled the hoses into the side 
    house together with the burning gear. He was curious what they would now do 
    and tried to enter the door, however, was blocked off by crew members. He

    because he was curious due to the strange behaviour of the crew and saw that

</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>3. The Bow Ramp</b> 
    was the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck and 
    as such had to be mandatorily weathertight. Therefore the ramp required regular 
    maintenance of the rubber packings, the hinge arrange-ment and the locking 
    devices. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before 
    10 m of the rubber packings should have been renewed already during the yard 
    time in January 1993, however, this was never done up to the casualty. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers 
    to the locking devices of the bow ramp which should have been serviced and 
    strengthened already in January 1993, which was also never done. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst damaged 
    and missing rubber packings cause a bow ramp which is otherwise in proper 
    condition to leak, this becomes much worse if the bow ramp is visibly misaligned 
    and twisted. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This had been 
    the case on ESTONIA for several months before the casualty and the condition 
    deteriorated as time went by. It is a fact that water was penetrating the 
    bow ramp already in 1993 according to the evidence of passengers and pilots. 
    In particular the statement of the Stockholm pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a> - is striking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following drawing 
    clearly demonstrates that already in calm sea the water rose above the 3rd 
    stringer inside the also severely leaking visor due to the height of the bow 
    wave at full speed. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg305.jpg" width="437" height="396"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the lower part 
    of the deck opening with the missing and/or damaged rubber packings (see arrow 
    on drawing) was below the 3rd stringer level of the closed visor, it is obvious 
    that water penetrated the car deck already in calm sea when the vessel was 
    on full speed (height of bow wave ca. 2.5 m). It is also obvious that the 
    water inside the visor rose when the vessel was pitching in head seas. The 
    height of the water inside the visor depended on the height of the outside 
    water level, i.e. when the ferry was taking green water on the forecastle 
    for a certain time the visor would fill up more or less completely with respective 
    water pressure on the leakage of the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since absolutely 
    nothing had been done to improve the condition of the rubber packings and 
    also no maintenance to the bow ramp had taken place since the vessel was put 
    under Estonian flag, also the condition of the ramp hinges, in particular 
    the port outer one, deteriorated continuously. This process was being sped 
    up by the wrong loading of the car deck through the also apparently in this 
    respect rather inexperienced Estonian officers, because the vessel frequently 
    had a list during loading/unloading when the heavy trucks were rolling on/off 
    board via the bow ramp and the effect on the already pre-damaged and weakened 
    hinges of the bow ramp was disastrous. This finally led to the complete destruction 
    of the port outer hinge and the breaking of the inner lug connecting the ramp 
    to the vessel, whilst the outer lug slid off the hinge bolt apparently after 
    the securing plate was broken off. The result is explained by a truck driver 
    who witnessed this incident as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I drove on 
      board as one of the last trucks and after leaving my truck I saw that the 
      crew tried to close the bow ramp, which was not possible because only the 
      starboard side came up while the port side remained down. Only after several 
      ups and downs of the ramp and some other things done by the crew did they 
      finally manage to close the ramp. Ever since then the ramp was visibly twisted 
      and when the visor opened and the bow ramp was still "closed", light fell 
      in through the upper left corner.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above is based 
    on a telephone conversation in December 1997. It has not yet been possible 
    to take the statement of the truck driver.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This severe damage 
    to the port outer hinge and to the ramp itself was reported by the crew to 
    the technical managers and also put on the repair list several times according 
    to Börje Stenström (see Enclosure 12.5.166). However, nothing was done to 
    rectify this damage despite the fact that it constituted a severe violation 
    of the SOLAS - and Class - requirements because evidently the open car deck 
    was, via the leaking bow ramp, connected to the visor which at sea was filled 
    with water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As no maintenance 
    took place the crew tried to seal the leaks as best they could by putting 
    mattresses, blankets and rags into the openings between the ramp and car deck/bulkhead 
    at the port lower corner. As a further consequence of the detached port lower 
    side of the bow ramp the port lower securing bolt no longer fitted into the 
    ramp pocket, whilst the upper port bolt fitted only to a limited extent and 
    it is doubtful whether the port ramp hook was able to engage the lug at the 
    ramp side at all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These very severe 
    deficiencies led to continuous problems for the crew when opening and closing 
    the bow ramp and/or the locking devices which had been observed by many passengers, 
    in particular by the truck drivers using the ferry twice a week or more as 
    summarised in Chapter 12.4. These observations prove that the bow ramp as 
    well as its locking devices had been in a very poor state of maintenance and 
    that they no more fulfilled the SOLAS and the Class requirements.</font></p>

      Ulf Hobro was the inspector/ superintendent of the vessel for the whole 
      time and spent a large part of his working time on MV "Estonia". Hobro checked 
      the condition of the vessel regularly regardless of what the master, chief 
      officer and chief engineer did. <br>
      Tomas Rasmusson, who is one of N&T's own chief engineers, assisted the N&T 
      operations organisation with the preparation work for ca. 2 months before

      at the Estline Terminal in Stockholm the whole time and was responsible 
      for negotiating and purchasing spare parts, lashing material, and other 
      technical equipment and consumables for MV "Estonia".«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- With the exception 
    of the unscheduled drydockings due to the leaking stern tube seals in March 
    and April 1993, the vessel under the management of N&T was only once at the 
    Yard and in drydock, i.e. in January 1994 in Turku, when the stabilisers were 
    installed and the ice paint was touched up the last time. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At that time 
    the B.V. surveyor Anders Wirstam carried out a Load Line Survey, which normally 
    should have included the rubber packings of the visor. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
      At that time Ulf Hobro knew very well from the specification of the previous 
      crew that they had asked for a renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way 
      of the visor, which was never carried out. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- This was said to 
    be the last time that Ulf Hobro had been inside the closed visor near the 
    Atlantic lock. There were smaller leakages of the hydraulic cylinders of the 
    Atlantic lock and the side locks as well as the bow ramp, which were said 
    to be normal according to him. Larger hydraulic oil leakages inside the visor 
    were said to be unknown to the Inspection Department of N&T.</font></p>

    packings had been renewed in way of the visor. <i>"Why should they?" </i>asked 
    Ulf Hobro. <i>"It was known to everybody that the visor was anyway full of 
    water at sea and this was also the explanation for the white paint washed 
    off in the area below the 3rd stringer."<br>

    being confronted with the photos showing the severely oil-stained 3rd stringer

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- According 
    to his knowledge there had never been problems, neither with the Atlantic 
    lock nor with the side locks. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Upon being 
    confronted with the empty sensor plate of the Atlantic lock he reacted with 
    surprise and then drew attention to the changed system on board of MARE BALTICUM 
    (where the sensors had been mounted higher up above the normal water level). 
    He promised to clarify this with the electrician having survived, who was 
    now serving on board of MARE BALTICUM.</font></p>

      the underwater videos, moreover the cables leading to the sensors were evidently 
      cut. These facts were presented to Ulf Hobro, who apparently subsequently 
      spoke to ESCO and the result was the 'Explanatory Note' with sketch dated 
      23.02.95 which was submitted shortly afterwards to JAIC. The note states 
      <i>"that contrary to the von Tell drawing 49111-373 showing mechanical sensors,

      over, which were not replaced, but just the distance was regulated and the 
      indication checked. It is assumed that these 'sensitive elements' had already 
      been installed during newbuilding as the same type can also be found on

    between the spring of 1994 and September 1994 to the effect that the green 
    light did not go on if the bolt was closed. The problem was said to be solved 
    by a simple adjustment of the magnetic switch. These problems were mentioned 
    already by Henrik Sillaste and Tanel Moosaar during the interview on 10.03.95 
    in Stockholm see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.174.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.174.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    information received by one of the Finnish engineers from one of the Estonian 
    engineers shortly after the casualty the magnetic switches had actually been 
    destroyed by ice hacking already in February/March 1994 and were not replaced, 
    because crew members had to go down anyway to hammer close and open the bolt 
    of the Atlantic lock - see statement Arvi Myyryläinen <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.175.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.175</a> - and therefore it was decided not to renew the switches for 
    the time being.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Stabilisers 
    were installed into pockets already arranged at newbuilding with respective 
    electrical connections. The installation - according to Hobro - became necessary 
    after less than one year in service to be able to compete also in this respect 
    with the Helsinki ferries from Silja and Viking.</font></p>

        a matter of fact, Hobro had asked the Turku Repair Yard already in April 
        1993 to quote for the installation of stabilisers, i.e. after less than 
        3 months in service the management had to realise that the vessel was 
        now trading in a completely different sea area with a much rougher sea

        short time planned for installation of the stabilisers at the shipyard 
        even shorter. Reportedly the required careful welding work to install 
        the starboard stabiliser therefore could not be carried out as it otherwise

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I'm not quite 
        certain of the exact date, but one afternoon after half past four I was 
        busy with painting the bow visor on the deck. As the bow is in raised 
        position only in Tallinn, I was painting the part that was otherwise not 
        visible. Before painting I had also polished and primed the visor. While 
        painting, I once again could not help noticing the cracks in the bow visor 
        fastenings, which were the result of the fatigue of metal. When repainting 
        the bow visor, I noticed them too. The cracks were visible only with the 
        bow in raised position. The starboard side fastening mechanism/box of 
        the visor had a crack of nearly 10 cm in length. The port side one had 
        a 6 cm long crack. There was also a crack in the welding between the bow 
        visor and the fastening beam, which was about 2 cm long. I am prepared 
        to show the location of the cracks on drawings.«</i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: When were observations 
    made of cracks in the visor of "Estonia"? <br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: I 
    observed them while painting on the bow deck of the "Estonia" in early August 
    1994. Painting was done in the port of Tallinn.<br>
    Q: In what position was the visor when you were working? <br>
    A: The visor was open, otherwise we could not have seen the cracks.<br>
    Q: What colours did you paint? <br>
    A: Both green and white (i.e. both the deck surface and areas rising from 
    the deck).<br>
    Q: Can you show on the visor where the cracks were?<br>
    A: Those parts have been removed, this is why I cannot show the crack locations.</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    (Upon instructions of Börje Stenström the hinge remains had been removed for 
    metallographic investigations and mechanical testing already in January, that 
    is why the crack locations could not be demonstrated.) <br>
    <i>Q: Could you indicate on these sketches where the cracks were?<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: You 
    have to look from forward to aft at the hinges to be able to see the cracks 
    in the welding seams between the bushings and the hinge plates of the visor 
    hinges (hinges at the visor). The cracks were opposite to the deck when the 
    visor was closed. At the starboard hinge there were cracks in both welds. 
    At port side there was only one crack in the weld. The drawing below shows 
    the location and approximate length of the cracks. </font></i></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Q: Could you tell 
    us a bit more in detail about the paint work and the damage to the visor?<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: Actually 
    the damage could only be seen when the visor was open. There were very many. 
    On a drawing one could see that more in detail. Actually at one side there 
    were these cracks. Possibly as a result of mechanical action.<br>
    Q: You said on one side the crack was 10 cm long and on the other side about 
    6 cm long? This is written in your statement.<br>
    A: This might have been so.<br>
    Q: Quite sometime has passed but I assume that you are not going to withdraw 
    your written statement?<br>
    A: No.<br>
    A: I did not inform the boatswain about my observations. It was the time when 
    the cars were rolling on board. And the boatswain ... you had to work with 
    him. He did observe exactly. He disliked it if somebody did not work during 
    his working time. Then I did not get a chance to tell him. I was actually 
    of the opinion that it was known anyway. Therefore I forgot to report it.<br>
    Q: What was the condition of the visor when you started to work?<br>
    A: I did not have specific instructions to do something at a particular location. 
    During my work I was climbing everywhere, cleaned and painted. This location 
    was difficult to reach. Presumably the last time this area had been painted 
    was when the vessel was painted white for the first time. I thought that certainly 
    somebody from the administration knew about the cracks because the vessel 
    was checked quite often. Also the boatswain checked our work. Therefore I 
    believe that certainly somebody knew of the cracks.<br>
    Q: Thus you were convinced that due to the frequent checks that somebody knew 
    about the condition of the visor and also of the cracks? <br>
    A: Yes, I was sure that they knew it. <br>
    Q: Did the crack appear only after you had removed the paint? <br>
    A: No, the crack was visible already before.<br>
    Q: It was consequently enough to climb there to see the crack?<br>
    A: Yes. </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of these 
    three statements it has to be concluded that the welding seams between the 
    bushings and hinge plates of the visor hinges were visibly cracked up to 10 
    cm at the beginning of August 1994, less than 8 weeks before the casualty.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The photo below 
    shows a part cut out of the bushing recovered by divers from the wreck. It 
    is most probably the starboard inner bushing as will be explained in Chapter 
    30.</font></p>

    of stb. inner bushing recovered by divers</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For a better understanding, 
    the relevant parts have been numbered as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 = steel bushing 
      <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2 = hinge 
      plate <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3 = area 
      between hinge plate/bushing<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 = welding 
      material <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 = arrow 
      pointing to the large gap between bushing and hinge plate <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">6 = welding 
      seams between bushing/hinge plate</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Without going too 
    much into detail, already now attention has to be drawn to some very obvious 
    irregularities, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The bushing had 
    been too small for the bore of the hinge plate (2), therefore a gap (5) remained 
    between bushing and inner surface of the hinge plate. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding 
    seams (6) are rather weak compared to the dimension of hinge plate and bushing. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There had 
    obviously been a crack at the left side in the welding seam (4) which had 
    been tried to be closed by welding. This led to the accumulation of welding 
    material inside the gap between bushing / hinge plate. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The surface 
    area between hinge plate/bushing (3) is severely corroded which would not 
    have been possible if the inside had been airtight by intact welding seams. 
    In other words, the apparent fact that the space between bushing/hinge plate 
    could be attacked by corrosion as found is proof that the welding seams had 
    been cracked over the full thickness for a longer time already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) That there was 
    something seriously wrong at least with the starboard hinge arrangement of 
    the visor well before the casualty becomes very obvious when having a close 
    look at the<b> video film made by a passenger upon departure from Tallinn 
    on 17 September 1994</b>, i.e. 10 days before ESTONIA's last sailing. He stood 
    on the open forepart of the 8th deck and with his video camera filmed the 
    closing of the visor. Thereby he zoomed in on the starboard hinge arrangement. 
    The subsequent evaluation of the video proved that the starboard visor hinges 
    were totally misaligned with the lower part of the outer bushing as well as 
    the securing plate missing. The video was analysed and evaluated in detail 
    by the Reconnaissance Expert Bryan Roberts of Churchgate/UK and his report 
    is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.180. </a></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Although the distortion 
    and misalignment of the starboard hinge is clearly visible to everybody, the 
    Swedish part of JAIC gave a copy of the film to the Military Intelligence 
    Service, who produced the picture attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.181.1</a>, which evidently shows the same. Nevertheless, the Intelligence 
    people declared the whole film to be unreliable since 5 out of about 800 sequences 
    had been slightly "jumping", which was accepted by the JAIC as well as N&T 
    and the film from then on was ignored by the JAIC and consequently is also 
    not mentioned in their Report. What the film really shows becomes clear on 
    the enlargement below, viz. some major deficiencies:</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg325.jpg" width="265" height="226"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the gap between 
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (Arrow 
    1).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the outer 
    bushing is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (Arrow 
    2) (which explains the large gap mentioned above).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the lower 
    part of outer bushing is missing. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the securing 
    plate is missing and the outer end of the bolt is not visible. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the outer 
    bushing appears to be twisted anti-clockwise. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the inner 
    bushing appears to be twisted anti-clockwise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Bearing in mind 
    that the nautical student Rain Oolmets reported the cracks observed at the 
    beginning of August 1994 immediately after he had learned of the casualty 
    to his uncle, who was then sailing as chief officer for ESCO, and the uncle 
    went to the police who subsequently interrogated the student on 03.10.94, 
    it is difficult to believe that Rain Oolmets had remained silent on the real 
    damage to the starboard hinge, had it been there already.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the other hand, 
    he had told Klaus Rahka during the questioning at Hangö on 24.03.95 that he 
    had painted the visor hinges green and white and - as clearly visible on the 
    video image on the following page showing the starboard hinge bolt - there 
    is quite a lot of green paint on the bolt which could not possibly have got 
    there as long as the hinges were in their original, intact condition because 
    then it was practically a closed system, i.e. paint could not reach the bolt. 
    The intact system has no gap as can be seen from the drawing below showing 
    the intact starboard hinge arrangement.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg326.jpg" width="457" height="164"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it is, however, 
    obvious from the video print below, showing the starboard bolt - without bushing 
    - resting on the rail bar, there is a stripe of green paint at the bolt. Measurements 
    reveal that the paint is in way of the gap between the outer bushing and the 
    vessel hinge plate which is visible on the enlarged video print on the previous 
    page (Arrow 1).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg327.jpg" width="298" height="205"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore it has 
    to be concluded that the gap must have been there already when the green paint 
    was applied, however, this will be evaluated more in detail in Chapter 29/30. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Oolmets commenced 
    his job mid July 1994 and left the vessel on the 11 September 1994. He had 
    discovered up to 10 cm long cracks in the weldings between bushings and visor 
    hinge plates both at port side and starboard side of the visor hinges when 
    the visor was open. This was in early August, at a time after 16.30 hours 
    when the loading of the trucks had already commenced. The boatswain then on 
    board was Vello Ruben, thus it was the Andresson crew. Considering the fact 
    that the Andresson and Piht crews relieved each other every 14 days, further 
    that the Andresson crew would have been relieved on the 29.09.94, thus came 
    on board on 15 September 1994, going back from that date in 14-day intervals, 
    it becomes obvious that the early August time for the Andresson crew with 
    Vello Ruben as boatswain ended on 4 August 1994 in Tallinn. As on that day 
    the crews would change in the morning, the loading of the trucks after 16.30 
    hrs was already attended by the boatswain of the relief crew, Heino Leik. 
    As on the day before, 3 August 1994, the vessel had been in Stockholm, it 
    has to be concluded that Rain Oolmets found the cracks on<b> 2 August 1994 
    </b>as this is the only day in early August when Vello Ruben was on the car 
    deck after 16.30 hours. The Andresson crew returned on 18 August 1994, but 
    this date or later would hardly be considered early August by Rain Oolmets. 
    On 11 September 1994 he left the vessel (see time schedule of crew change 
    -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.182.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    12.5.182</a>).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If he had finished 
    painting the starboard hinges, which has to be assumed as he stayed on board 
    for another 6 weeks after discovery of the cracks in early August, there must 
    have been quite a gap between the inside of the outer visor hinge plate and 
    the outside of the outer hinge plate at the vessel's side, as otherwise it 
    would not have been possible for such green deck paint to reach the bolt.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This could 
    indicate that the repairs to the starboard hinges of the visor had already 
    been carried out when Rain Oolmets discovered the reported cracks on 2 August 
    1994. It would, of course, mean that he told the criminal police as well as 
    JAIC only part of the truth, which would not be surprising.</font></p>

    the statement of<b> 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür</b> he was also responsible for 
    all watertight (weathertight) openings of the vessel, their maintenance and 
    proper functioning. In his statement taken on 3 October 1994 by the Estonian 
    security police in Tallinn - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.5.183</a> - <b>Peeter Tüür</b>, who is the highest ranking officer 
    to have survived, has testified: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I am the 2nd 
      Engineer. Each engineer has his tasks. Part of my tasks were the watertight 
      openings and to keep the technical functioning in order. It was also my 
      responsibility to see that the visor was in order, but I was specifically 
      responsible for the hydraulic of the visor. The closing of the visor was 
      carried out by the boatswain, however, I am unaware who was directly responsible 
      for the closing, possibly the mate. <b>Behind the visor is the ramp. This 
      should also be hermetically tight, there are just a few places where the 
      ramp does not close hermetically. </b>The visor is closed hydraulically 
      and securing wedges fix the visor in closed condition. There are 5 fixing 
      points.«</i></font></p>

    is drawn up in a rather peculiar way and is signed by the chief engineers 
    Moosaar and Leiger. The list contains for example many repairs to dish washing 
    and slicing machines in the galley as well as the cleaning of search lights, 
    ventilation pipes, etc., however neither bow ramp nor visor are mentioned
