  Builders - Meyer Werft, Papenburg </font></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Meyer Werft - 
    Jos. L. Meyer GmbH - at Papenburg/Ems was founded already in 1795 and has 
    been owned by the Meyer family ever since. During the last decades Meyer Werft 
    has achieved an excellent reputation for the building of special-purpose vessels, 
    in particular, passenger ships, luxury car/passenger ferries and Ro-Ro vessels. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Up to date more than 
    60 of the above types of vessels have been built by Meyer Werft. Furthermore, 
    the Yard is specialised in the building of passenger-ships and gas carriers 
    for the transport of liquid and chemical gases. Presently about 60 passengerships/ferries 
    and 47 gas carriers have been delivered. Shiprepair activities are mainly 
    concentrated on jumboizing and converting ferries, passenger ships, freighters, 
    and tankers. In addition, the Yard is the world's leader in converting freighters 
    and tankers into livestock carriers. Up to now 25 vessels of this type have 
    been converted for the transport of sheep and cows as well as camels and horses. 
    Apart from the above-mentioned activities the Meyer Werft is also engaged 
    in structural construction and engine building, which includes the fabrication 
    of pressure tanks and special aluminium constructions. In 1975 a new shipyard 
    was built which belongs to the most modern in Europe. In November 1987 the 
    largest graving dock under roof was inaugurated which had to be lengthened 
    by 100 m already in 1990/91. Presently about 2000 staff are employed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">So far the Yard has 
    built respectively has under construction/on order: </font></p>

    </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious that 
    survival in a very competitive, tough market was and is only possible by fine 
    workmanship and delivery according to promise. For this the Meyer Werft is 
    well known. The "Reference Lists for Ferries and Gastankers" - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.1.1.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosures 2.1.1</a> / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..1.2.htm" target="_blank">2.1.2 
    </a>- confirm this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On this basis, as 
    well as having very good relationships to Sweden and Finland, the Meyer Werft 
    has succeeded since 1969 in obtaining orders to build a series of car/passenger 
    ferries for AB Slite/Stockholm and AB Sally/ Mariehamn and - apart from the 
    guarantee disputes usual for technically complicated newbuildings - delivering 
    these to the entire satisfaction of the buyers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All these vessels 
    - except for the last one: SILJA EUROPA - have been employed in the Viking 
    Line Service, either between Turku - Mariehamn - Stockholm or between Helsinki 
    and Stockholm. This service was then operated by a consortium consisting of 
    the Swedish AB Slite as well as the Finnish companies AB Sally and SF-Line. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first ferry of 
    these series by the name APOLLO was delivered in 1970 to AB Slite, followed 
    by MV DIANA for the same owners, and VIKING 1, 3, 4 and 5 for AB Sally. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The third partner 
    of the Viking Line consortium, SF-Line, ordered their newbuildings with other 
    yards, e.g. the TURELLA was built by Sietas Yard, Hamburg and other ferries 
    were built in Yugoslavia as well as by the then Wärtsilä Yard in Turku, Finland 
    (e.g. MARIELLA). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All of the vessels 
    built by Meyer Werft for AB Slite and AB Sally were classed by Bureau Veritas 
    (B.V.) and built under the supervision of the respective National Shipping 
    Administration, i.e. for the Slite vessels the Swedish Sjöfartsverket and 
    for the AB Sally vessels the Finnish Sjöfarts-styrelsen, the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation (F.B.N.). The 6 ferries were sister vessels, apart from VIKING 
    5 which had the same breadth but was 13.8 m longer. All vessels were constructed 
    with visor, bow and stern ramps. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The building files 
    of Meyer Werft reveal that due to the continued close co-operation lasting 
    for years between the Yard, supervisors of owners as well as representatives 
    of class and Sjöfartsverket respectively F.B.N. a relationship of confidence 
    had developed between the participating persons. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On behalf of Bureau 
    Veritas this was their inspector Günther Lohmann, who was engaged with Meyer 
    Werft newbuildings for many years, whilst Sjöfartsverket was represented by 
    the then Rotterdam office manager, H. Sjöholm and the representatives for 
    F.B.N. were Gunnar Edelmann (shipbuilding matters/stability), Pertti Haatainen 
    (lifesaving) and Jan Jansson (fire-fighting).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All 6 vessels had 
    the connection visor/bow ramp, i.e. the upper part of the closed bow ramp 
    extended into a box-shaped structure on the forecastle which was part of the 
    visor. None of the vessels had the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above the bulkhead deck, i.e. the car deck, installed at the location which 
    was required by SOLAS since 1948, but the weathertight bow ramp was generally 
    considered to be the extension of the collision bulkhead. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Despite this deviation 
    from the wording of SOLAS all these vessels, as well as more than 30 other 
    ferries constructed similarly, were fully accepted by the Classification Societies 
    and by the Maritime Administrations of the Nordic countries. According to 
    the findings of the JAIC this practice was well known to insiders as the 'General 
    Scandinavian Practice'. </font></p>
