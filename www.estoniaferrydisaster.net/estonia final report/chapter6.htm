<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Already in October 
      1992 the formalities to buy the WASA KING ex VIKING SALLY were finalised 
      and the decision made, to operate the vessel under Estonian flag with Estonian 
      crew. Since the Estonian Ships Register was not accepted by the mortgagee 
      banks, the vessel had to be registered with one of the acknowledged Ships 
      Registers and Cyprus was selected. To permit an additional entry in the 
      Estonian Bareboat Register - condition to fly the Estonian flag and to employ 
      Estonian crew - the structure of owning/operating/ managing companies as 
      below stated was created.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> MV ESTONIA was 
      owned by the Cyprus company Estline Marine Company Ltd. The shares of this 
      company were owned 50% by Estonian Shipping Company (ESCO) and 50% by Nordthulin 
      Luxembourg S.A., which is a wholly owned daughter company of Nordström & 
      Thulin AB (N&T), Stockholm, whilst ESCO was owned by the Estonian Government. 
      The vessel was registered in Cyprus with permission for parallel registry 
      in Estonia on the basis of a bareboat charter party. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason for 
      the vessel being registered in Cyprus was - as said before - the demand 
      of the mortgagee, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), 
      that the vessel had to be entered in a register with mortgage security acceptable 
      to the bank, which was not the case with the Estonian register. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was 
      chartered by Estline Marine Company Ltd. to the Estonian company E-Line 
      Ltd. (E-Line) on basis of a bareboat charter party. E-Line is owned 50% 
      each by ESCO and Nordthulin Luxembourg.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">MV ESTONIA was 
      then registered in the Estonian bareboat register and therefore had the 
      right and obligation to sail under Estonian flag and with Estonian crew. 
      </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bareboat charter 
      agreement provided - as is usual - that the vessel was let without crew 
      and that the bareboat charterer was responsible for crewing and all other 
      obligations of a ship-owning company.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bareboat charterer 
      E-Line contracted ESCO on the basis of a Ship Management Contract to provide 
      the crews and to take care of technical maintenance/operations as well as 
      insurance. The reason for this was that ESCO was a Tallinn based, state-owned 
      stock company. Its history dates back to 1879, when the first shipping company 
      Linda was established in Estonia. ESCO operated worldwide a variety of cargo 
      vessels of up to 50,000 dwt. ESCO also operated passenger ferries in the 
      Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Finland. In the autumn of 1994 the company 
      owned and operated 55 vessels and thus had considerable better possibilities 
      than E-Line in dealing with crew matters, such as employment, quality control, 
      education/training and follow-up.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> ESCO for their 
      part left the technical maintenance/operation on the basis of a respective 
      subcontract to N&T, allegedly being more competent and experienced in respect 
      of larger passenger ferries than ESCO and also having better connections 
      to suppliers of equipment and spare parts, etc. Also insurance matters and 
      administration were left to N&T having more experience than ESCO with the 
      international insurance of vessels. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On basis of an 
      agency agreement, E-Line also subcontracted the commercial activities (sale 
      of tickets and freight, hotel - restaurant activities on board, terminal 
      activities, etc.) to the Swedish company ESTLINE AB, which was owned 50/50 
      by ESCO and N&T. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of Estline 
      AB's Estonian sister companies, Estonian Ferry Services Ltd. (EFS), had 
      the responsibility for the sale of tickets and freight in Estonia as well 
      as the terminal activities in Tallinn, whilst Estline AB took care of the 
      Swedish side.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Details of the 
      structure of companies explained above can be taken from the next page and

  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a matter of 
      fact all the owning/operating/servicing/managing companies in relation to 
      the ESTONIA were owned equally by N&T and ESCO.</font></p>

</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Estonian National 
      Maritime Board (E.N.M.B) was only established after Estonia's independence 
      in 1991 and thus had no experienced inspectors to carry out the safety inspections 
      on large and complicated vessels which were required from the flag state 
      by SOLAS. It was apparently for this reason that B.V. was asked whether 
      they would be prepared to perform, in addition to their obligations as Classification 
      Society, the safety inspections. B.V. obviously agreed and a respective 
      contract was signed already on 18 August 1992, a copy of which is attached 
      as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.2.114.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.2.114.</a> 
      Another contract was agreed and signed by B.V. and N&T which dealt apparently 
      with activities in addition to the normal relationship between owner respectively 
      technical manager and the Classification Society. This contract is in the 
      files of the JAIC and remains classified even after the publication of the 
      Final Report. It is only known that the parties to the contract have agreed 
      to refer disputes to London Arbitration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
      then head of Sjöfartsverket's Stockholm inspection office, Ulf Beijner, 
      however, also B.V. was uncertain about the requirements to be performed 
      by the Maritime Administration of the new flag state in case of a large 
      and almost 13 year old car/passenger ferry like ESTONIA. Therefore Sjöfartsverket 
      was asked to render assistance during the take-over inspections at Turku 
      and Tallinn, perform the "operative control" and whatever else might be 
      required as a consequence of the flag change.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It will be explained 
      in the subsequent subchapter that Sjöfartsverket complied with this request 
      against respective payments and a rather close co-operation between the 
      otherwise totally different organisations N&T, B.V./ E.N.M.B and Sjöfartsverket 
      in connection with the take-over and flag change of the ESTONIA commenced.
