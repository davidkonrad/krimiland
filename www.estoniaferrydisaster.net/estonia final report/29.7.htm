  The Stern Area</b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">While the ferry was 
    sinking in completely upside down condition the stern area had the first contact 
    with the sea bottom. The bow was still above sea level at this time with the 
    bulbous bow being the highest point. See the drawing below.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the superstructure 
    in way of the port side aft part of the 8th and 7th decks were found to be 
    indented and bulged by the divers it has to be assumed that she was somewhat 
    more heeled to port when touching the sea bottom as a result of which the 
    above indentations were caused. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ROV tape made 
    on 02.10.94 indicates that the starboard stern ramp is slightly open as can 
    be seen on the adjacent image. It shows the upper inner side. The explanation 
    for this slight opening was given already in Subchapter 21.3.3 by the statement 
    of Rolf Sörman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.335.1</a> - who, as well as his seminar colleagues, were disturbed 
    to such extent by hydraulic noises that they gave up their conference at 21.45 
    hours ET.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the 2nd main 
    hydraulic station was located at the starboard side aft on the car deck level 
    directly below the conference area this is the only installation able to produce 
    the explained disturbing noise level. It can furthermore be reasonably assumed 
    that the hydraulic pumps had been started and kept running to open the starboard 
    stern ramp slightly by means of the ice breaking cylinders and keep the ramp 
    in this position by operating the control time and again in the closing mode 
    to press the ramp against the ice breaking cylinders as it would otherwise 
    more open/close due to the very hard pitching of the ferry. The slight opening 
    of the starboard stern ramp allowed the excessive water on the car deck, continuously 
    penetrating through the unclosed bow ramp from the water filled visor, to 
    run out at the stern. This worked, of course, only as long as the ferry had 
    a stern trim and a starboard list. Both was the case until about 23.30 hours 
    when the visor was more or less full and the trim changed to down by head. 
    For further details see Chapter 31 - The Casualty Scenario. The pictures below 
    show the stern ramp arrangements in port. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed 
    that the starboard stern ramp was completely unlocked as it otherwise could 
    not be slightly open and that the reason for this slightly open condition 
    is the almost upside down condition of the wreck. It has further to be assumed 
    that the stern ramp has been much more open during casualty sequence-of-events 
    because latest after the shut-down of the auxiliary diesels the hydraulic 
    pumps stopped since not being connected to the emergency generator. This means 
    that subsequently the starboard stern ramp slowly opened completely or more 
    or less completely while the ferry heeled more and more to starboard which 
    led to massive water ingress onto the car deck and through the big lift opening 
    at the aft end of the centre casing also into the large provision area in 
    the aft of deck 1 and so on. This is most probably the explanation for the 
    ferry sinking by the stern. </font></p>
