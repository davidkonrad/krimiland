<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b> THE SJÖFARTSVERKET INSPECTORS<br>
  AND THEIR TRAINEES</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In accordance 
    with the treaty between the Swedish and the Estonian Goverments "Maritime 
    Transport and Safety at Sea and Prevention from Pollution on Marine Environment 
    Projects, Phase IV", signed 03.02.93, the Swedish Sjöfartsverket had sold 
    an education package to the Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B) which 
    was paid for by the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS) 
    and which, among other things, required Sjöfartsverket to train and educate 
    Estonian master mariners and engineers employed with the E.N.M.B. to carry 
    out Port State Control (PSC) surveys on own and foreign vessels and to issue 
    the respective certificates. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In Annex A of the 
    treaty the "Scope of Services" is outlined and with reference to "Port State 
    Control" (PSC) the following is explained:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Brush-up seminars 
      and <b>on the job training </b>for ship inspectors in Tallinn, implementing 
      the Port State Control methodology. <b>The training will be carried out 
      in Tallinn.</b>«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In Annex B the obligations 
    of the Estonian side are specified. Under item 7 it is stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»To provide 
      all necessary permits, including facilitation of visa formalities and <b>authorisations 
      for the carrying out of the services.</b>«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 02.02.94 the 
    board of BITS agreed to provide the required amount of SEK 574.340,--. The 
    respective agreement contains the following definition in respect of PSC:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The training 
      will be performed in Estonia in one-week seminars for 8-14 participants 
      in accordance with international standards. The seminars include <b>on-the-job 
      training, i.e. in practice actual inspections of vessels in international 
      trade. Our inspectors do expect participants from the E.N.M.B., those responsible 
      for PSC in Tallinn as well as those responsible for safety in ESCO.«</b></i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is revealed from 
    the above that the Estonian authorities did initiate and order the advisory 
    services of Sjöfartsverket. As regards the PSC these services should consist 
    of<b> on-the-job training and actual inspections</b> on board of vessels employed 
    in international trade <b>in the port of Tallinn</b>. According to the treaty 
    the <b>Estonians were obliged to authorise the Swedish inspectors properly 
    for this job.<br>
    </b>This could only mean that in the light of the treaty and also through 
    the confirmation by the board of BITS, these <b>on-the-job inspections were 
    considered to be normal PSC inspections by properly authorised inspectors.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the 
    legal background for these inspections - the SOLAS 1974 Convention and the 
    Paris Memorandum of Understanding - the Paris MOU - reference is made to the 
    report of the Independent Fact Group, Stockholm about the <i>"Forgery of Documents 
    to hide the initial Unseaworthiness of the 'Estonia' "</i>, which is attached

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The task to 
    train the Estonians was assigned to the Shipinspec office Malmö headed by 
    chief inspector Åke Sjöblom. With regard to this project he reported to Willand 
    Ringborg of International Projects at the head office of Sjöfartsverket (HK 
    = Huved Kontor = head office) at Norrköping. (See also Subchapter 6.3.1.)<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In compliance 
    with the agreed training program chief inspector Åke Sjöblom and inspector 
    Gunnar Zahlée travelled to Tallinn on 26 September 1994 and met their high 
    ranking Estonian trainees on the morning of the 27th at the offices of the 
    Estonian National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.). These were according to the draft 
    report of Åke Sjöblom:</font></p>

    the morning with the theoretical part of the job the trainees decided to carry 
    out the practical part of it on board of the ferry ESTONIA considered to be

    proceeded on board after lunch and carried out a Port State Control inspection 
    during the "on-the-job training", the results of which were and still are

    one of the trainees, the head of the Ship Inspection Division of the Estonian 
    National Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.), Arne Valgma, was heard by the criminal

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Reportedly 
    Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée were heard by the Estonian Security Police in 
    their hotel during the night 28/29 September 1994. The statements are not 
    available.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The statement of 
    Ulf Beijner is, however, available. He has testified that at a confidential 
    meeting at the Sjöfartsverket's head office about 10 days after the casualty 
    Åke Sjöblom explained what they had really found on board the ESTONIA, viz. 
    the absolutely disastrous condition of the bow ramp, the mattresses, blankets 
    and rugs plugged into the gap at the lower corner in way of the severely damaged 
    port hinges, where the bow ramp was already detached from the vessel. Further 
    that they had consequently demanded from their highest ranking trainee, the 
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the E.N.B.M., Arne Valgma, that the 
    ferry should under no circumstances sail in this condition, which was said 
    to have been rejected by him and subsequently by the Estonian authorities 
    up to the highest level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above has been 
    confirmed by a colleague of Ulf Beijner, the next-in-charge of another district, 
    who added that Åke Sjöblom then - after the Estonians had rejected to stop 
    the ferry - spoke first to his direct superior, Sea Safety Director Bengt-Erik 
    Stenmark, who felt unable to do anything because they had no authority in 
    Tallinn, and subsequently, to the General Director of Sjöfartsverket, Kaj 
    Janérus, who felt also unable to do anything to stop the ferry. The result 
    is well known and 8 hours later the ESTONIA was down at the bottom of the 
    sea and about 1000 people had lost their lives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The available information 
    and documentation shall now be discussed in detail, always with reference 
    to the Report of the Independent Fact Group - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.1.429.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.1.429</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The task of chief 
    inspector Åke Sjöblom and inspector Gunnar Zahlée was to demonstrate to a 
    rather high ranking group of Estonian Ship Safety officials, among them the 
    head of the Ship Inspection Division of the Estonian National Maritime Board, 
    Sea Safety Director Arne Valgma, the meaning and importance of Port State 
    Control inspections. The test object was ESTONIA, believed by the Estonian 
    trainees to be the best vessel of the Estonian merchant navy fleet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At the end of the 
    inspection a "Report of Inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding 
    on Port State Control" was jointly drawn up on a Sjöfartsverket form - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 15.200</a> 
    - which is frequently referred to and of which apparently several versions 
    do exist, because according to Arne Valgma's testimony to the police - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.204.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 15.204</a> 
    - there were only eight items noted on this document which was signed by himself 
    and he expressly confirmed that it did conform with their real findings and 
    that no other defects were noted. He declared further that of these eight 
    items, six were coded 99, i.e. could be rectified subsequently and only two 
    were coded 17, i.e. to be rectified before departure and this was just the 
    replacement of a wing screw from a galley window on the 7th deck and the closing 
    of two covers on car deck. This document is not available to this 'Group of 
    Experts'. The number and status of crucial items look quite different in the 
    "Report of Inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on 
    Port State Control" (hereafter called "The Report of Inspection") which was 
    submitted by Åke Sjöblom to the JAIC (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.200</a>) and which contains in total 15 items including the eight mentioned 
    by Arne Valgma in his statement and which is also signed by Arne Valgma, although 
    this "Report of Inspection" is on a form of the National Maritime Administration 
    (of Sweden). The additional items are</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These 
    five items had to be rectified before departure and were not mentioned by 
    Arne Valgma, probably because it is doubtful whether the crew could have managed 
    to rectify them before departure or he knew that they had not rectified them 
    before departure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The other four items 
    are coded 99, i.e. to be rectified subsequently. It means, however, that several 
    different "Reports of Inspection" must exist, viz. the one which was attached 
    to the statement of Arne Valgma to the Estonian Police (not available), the 
    one attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.200</a> and other versions as shown on pages 12 through 15 in the Report

    34.1.429</a> - and all were signed by Arne Valgma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is obvious that 
    Arne Valgma tried to hide the real findings from his superiors and the Estonian 
    police, because he, in his capacity as Director of the Sea Safety Division 
    of the E.N.M.B., had been obliged to make sure that the items had been rectified 
    before departure and if that could not have been achieved by the crew, the 
    ferry mandatorily should have stayed in port until all items had been rectified 
    to the satisfaction of the authorities. This is the reason why Arne Valgma 
    tried to play down the problems discovered on board and testified wrongly 
    and incompletely to the criminal police and, in addition, committed forgery 
    of documents - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.1.429.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    interview with the police inspector Egon Bergqvist - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.202.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    draft report and in the interview with the journalist from Spiegel TV - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.201.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 15.201</a>

    15.203</a> - he and Gunnar Zahlée went much more into detail. On the other 
    hand, it is quite obvious that during the latter interview the tape was switched 
    off when the really crucial parts, i.e. visor, bow ramp, car deck, competency 
    of crew, etc., were discussed and if really something had remained on the 
    tape, on the transcript it reads »unclear, disturbed, difficult to understand«.

    by public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Åke Sjöblom was interviewed 
    in February 1998, after the prosecutor had been in Papenburg, and stated the 
    following:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- it had just 
    been for training purposes, thus no valid PSC;</b> <br>
    - visor and bow ramp were open;<br>
    - it had been a limited inspection during which only <b>certain damage to 
    the rubber packings of the visor in the "corners of the mouth" were noted; 
    <br>
    - it looked as if the visor did not fit correctly anymore;<br>
    - perhaps it could be compared with a misaligned car door which was hanging 
    down somewhat but could still be closed and locked properly; <br>
    </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- it 
    is likely that during opening and closing there might have been a squeaking 
    sound, this, however, is no reason to question in hindsight the functioning 
    of the visor and locking devices.<br>
    </font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- To the 
    question: "<i>Did you try to stop the vessel from leaving Tallinn?</i>", he 
    replied: "<i>I have never said that I had tried to stop the vessel.<b> I had 
    no chance to stop it since it was an exercise and not a Port State Control</b></i><b>."</b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    aforementioned it has to be concluded that two top inspectors from the Swedish 
    Sjöfartsverket and nine (or ten) of the highest ranking government civil servants 
    from Estonian Ship Safety had inspected the ESTONIA during the afternoon before 
    her last departure from Tallinn for ca. 4-6 hours. They were accompanied by 
    her chief officer and her chief engineer when they made the relevant observations 
    which they have commented as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The<b> documentation</b> 
    was not to their satisfaction because:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the <b>safety 
      plan</b> and <b>muster list</b> were not according to regulation;<br>
      - the chief officer could not show them the<b> damage control plan</b> nor 
      could he show the <b>cargo securing manual; </b><br>
      - the chief officer could not submit the<b> stability booklet </b>and <b>did 
      not know where to search for it; <br>
      </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      also he could not submit the </font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">approved 
      stability manual;<br>
      - the chief officer was<b> unable to read a damage control plan;</b><br>
      - <b>bridge instructions were not available on the bridge;</b><br>
      - <b>vessel's characteristics in case of damage could not be viewed.<br>
      </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      the exemption certificate for liferafts was missing. </font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary they concluded 
    that the chief officer, who was the acting commanding officer since the master 
    was ashore, could not show them any of the relevant documents/certificates 
    and did not give them an explanation for this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(b) The mimic 
    panel on the bridge:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- the chief officer 
    did not really know which light meant open and which meant closed.</b><br>
    - he was of the opinion that the<b> green light meant "closed", although actually 
    it meant "open". </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(c) The watertight 
    doors and the fire doors:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - there was a problem 
    in way of the <b>galley where they had completely sabotaged the fire protection;</b><br>
    - in the area of the <b>boiler room nothing fitted at all. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(d) Lack of respect 
    for load line matters was noted on the car deck and in way of bow ramp/visor:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>hatch covers 
    were found open which should have been mandatorily closed,</b> but had been 
    open for the last one or two years (in two or three places). <br>
    - there was <b>big damage to the rubber packings of the visor in the "corners 
    of the mouth", </b>it was clear mechanical wear, about 0,5 m each side, it 
    can never have been tight the way it looked.<br>
    - there was also<b> some form of mechanical damage (to the visor) which indicated 
    that something did not fit properly.</b><br>
    - it looked as if <b>the visor did not fit anymore correctly</b>, perhaps 
    it could be <b>compared</b> to a <b>misaligned car door which was hanging 
    down some-what, but still could be closed and locked properly.</b><br>
    - they knew that <b>B.V. had written recommendations</b> about one month before, 
    <b>but the chief officer knew absolutely nothing about them and he was the 
    commanding officer. </b><br>
    - they were particularly dissatisfied with the visor and said so to the chief 
    officer,<b> they had the impression that there was a lack of respect for load 
    line matters.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    written recommendations by B.V. issued about one month before, i.e. probably 
    on 25.08.94, are unknown and are neither mentioned in the Final Report of 
    the JAIC nor are they part of the available documentation. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(e) Stability 
    calculations:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - they asked the 
    chief officer:<i> "Who carries out the stability calculations before departure?"</i>, 
    and he replied: <i>"The 2nd officer."</i> They waited for him but he never 
    showed up, which concerned them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(f) Cargo securing 
    devices:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - they found some 
    <b>cargo securing devices defect </b>and asked the chief officer whether he 
    would ever use them and he replied: <b><i>"If necessary."</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(g) The chief 
    officer and the crew in general: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- they <b>formulated 
    their findings</b> in each case so it was at least assured that they had drawn 
    attention to it and<b> left it with the commanding officer</b>. They had the 
    impression, however, that the <b>endeavours on board in this respect remained 
    limited. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Sjöfartsverket 
    inspectors finalised their comments by stating that: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Before the 
      background of what has happened, it is, of course, natural that also we 
      make a connection of certain things. But it is a fact that we had formulated 
      exactly: "We have seen a lack of respect for load line matters", and with 
      this we were particularly very dissatisfied.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In a subsequent 
    phone call Åke Sjöblom told Bengt Schager, the psychological expert of the 
    Swedish Commission, that the crew on board the ESTONIA was the worst he had 
    ever met in his long years of experience. On the other hand, Åke Sjöblom does 
    not create the impression that he has a bad conscience or feels guilty, which 
    is obviously due to the fact that he had tried whatever was in his powers 
    to stop the ferry from departing which, however, was in vain. Contrary to 
    Arne Valgma, who could have stopped the ferry, Åke Sjöblom indeed could have 
    done no more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be concluded here, that it is quite obvious that the Sjöfartsverket's inspectors 
    had found the ESTONIA to be unseaworthy in several respects and consequently 
    had done their utmost to avoid her departure which, however, had been in vain 
    since they did not have the authority to enforce this, although they should 
    have according to the treaty and the BITS agreement. See page 355. After the 
    casualty up to day everything has been done to keep this matter, with the 
    consent and assistance of the JAIC, unex-plained. It is for this reason that 
    the Swedish side and, in particular, Åke Sjöblom have emphasised time and 
    again that the inspection was not a proper PSC but just on-the-job training, 
    while the Estonian side, up to Minister level, still stresses that it was 
    a valid PSC and that the vessel had been found to be seaworthy otherwise she 
    would not have been permitted to sail. </font></p>
