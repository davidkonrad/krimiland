  Weather and Wave History</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The Swedish 
    Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) has investigated the weather 
    conditions met by WASA KING in the Gulf of Bothnia and by ESTONIA in comparison 
    to the wind and wave conditions met by ESTONIA on her last voyage. The result 
    is quoted as follows:</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»SMHI have earlier 
    studied and found that m/s ESTONIA the last 1-2 hours during the accident 
    night 27-28 Sept 1994 was exposed of: </i></font></p>

    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">* winds: direction

      significant wave height 3.5-4.5 m, with some possible maximum waves of 6.5-7.0 
      m.</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For m/s ESTONIA 
    earlier voyages we have found the similar conditions as follows:</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently ESTONIA 
    had encountered similar or worse wind and wave conditions at least 6 times 
    before the casualty in her last trading area, whereby the last time had been 
    only about 5 weeks before the casualty, i.e. at a time when the visor and 
    bow ramp had been in a very bad condition for several months already, as will 
    be explained later on. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The distance from 
    Tallinn to Söderarm is 173 nm, to Sandhamn 177 nm. The distance from Söderarm 
    to Frihamn, however, is 54 nm corresponding to 41/2 hours steaming time (in 
    most parts of the archipelago the speed is restricted to 12 kn), whilst the 
    distance from Sandhamn is only 42 nm corresponding to 3.5 hours steaming time. 
    Therefore the Sandhamn route was preferred. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Assuming that 
    ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on time (which was seldom the case) she was 
    turned on outbound course at the earliest 15 minutes later, whereafter it 
    needed some minutes to reach full speed (which is not taken into account). 
    The ferry consequently had <b>14.75 hours</b> to reach Stockholm.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    Söderarm entrance had to be used she had available for the 173 nm long sea 
    voyage 14.75 hours less 4.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>10.25 hours</b>, 
    i.e. she had to make an average speed of <b>16.87</b> kn to be at the pilot 
    station on time.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    Sandhamn entrance would be used, there was some more time because she had 
    available 14.75 hours less 3.5 hours through the archipelago = <b>11.25 hours</b>, 
    thus had to make an average speed of only <b>15.73 kn </b>to be on time at 
    the pilot station.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An evaluation 
    of the logbooks of the Stockholm pilots for the time between ESTONIA's first 
    call on 03.02.93 and her last call on 26.09.94 revealed the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - During 20 months 
      of service the ferry was only once delayed for 1 hour and that was on 1 
      January 1994 at the Sandhamn pilot station.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- At Frihamn 
      Terminal ESTONIA during the same period of time the ferry arrived late only 
      8 times with max. delay of 24 minutes (also on 01.01.94).<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- None of 
      these delays could apparently be attributed to weather influence.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Delays 
      occurred, however, generally upon departure from Stockholm, although only 
      seldom of more than 20 minutes. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In total, 
      the vessel departed from Stockholm 12 times with more than a 30-minute delay. 
      It has to be assumed that it was worse in Tallinn, according to the reports 
      of previous passengers. Pilot or harbour master logbooks from Tallinn, however, 
      are not available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An examination of 
    the logbook entries of the Stockholm Pilots Association for the three days, 
    when according to the SMHI ESTONIA had met wind and sea state conditions comparable 
    to those encountered during the night of the casualty, has revealed the following: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 5 February 1993 
    ESTONIA arrived at 05.59 hours at the Sandhamn Pilot, on 23 January 1994 at 
    05.43 hours at Söderarm Pilot and on 6 March 1994 at 05.25 hours at Sandhamn 
    Pilot. Consequently she was always on time. The respective logbook pages are 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.140.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.3.140</a>, <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.141.htm" target="_blank">12.3.141</a> 
    .<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since no detailed 
    information is available from the Estonian side and previous passengers frequently 
    experienced considerable delays on arrival in Tallinn, the eastbound voyages 
    cannot be evaluated.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    it is a fact that ESTONIA met at least 6 times similar or worse wind and wave 
    conditions compared to those she met on the night of the accident, however, 
    without delayed arrival (on the westbound voyages) and it is unknown whether 
    damage to the visor and its locking devices were sustained. The last time 
    she met similar conditions was only on 19 August 1994, i.e. 5 weeks before 
    the casualty, and at this time all the disastrous deficiencies - as will be 
    explained later on - were already existing. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation 
    of the arrival times at the Stockholm Pilot stations outlined above also reveals 
    that ESTONIA obviously always maintained her schedule, regardless of the prevailing 
    weather and/or ice conditions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation for 
    this adherence to schedule by all means and under all circumstances can probably 
    be found in</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the pride 
      of the newcomer wanting to be at least as good as the competitors Silja 
      and Viking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the pressure 
      of competition from the large and more comfortable Stockholm-Helsinki ferries 
      which - according to Ulf Hobro - was also the reason for the installation 
      of stabilisers at high costs after less than 1 year in service. As a matter 
      of fact Ulf Hobro had asked Turku Repair Yard already in the beginning of 
      April 1993, i.e. after ESTONIA had been in service for just 2 months, but 
      mainly in bad weather, to quote for the installation of stabilisers. The 
      offer was submitted on 5 April 1993 and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.3.143.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      12.3.143</a>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The pressure on 
    the masters of ESTONIA from the Board members of Estline AB is confirmed by 
    the statement of Captain Per Ringhagen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/5.3.111.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    5.3.111</a> - who has stated that during board meetings of Estline AB it had 
    been repeatedly stressed that ESTONIA had to maintain her arrival at Stockholm 
    by all means and that this had been made quite clear to the masters, who sometimes 
    attended the board meetings. This is said to be written in the protocols of 
    these board meetings which must be still available. The apparent fact that 
    the masters of ESTONIA did their utmost to maintain the schedule was obviously 
    not unknown to the crew as it is demonstrated by the questioning of motorman 
    Ziljajev, who testified in this connection as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b><i>Q</i></b><i>: 
    Was it a must or was it a requirement from the management that ESTONIA or 
    any other vessel may not miss her schedule, i.e. be delayed?<br>
    <b>A:</b> With ESTONIA we were always on time. The master had a time schedule 
    received from the owners and we were always on time. The masters always followed 
    the schedule received from the company. According to contract he had to follow 
    this schedule. <br>
    <b>Q:</b> You have now told us about the obligations of the master to follow 
    the schedule. There are rumours that masters who are unable to keep the schedule 
    will be sacked. <br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes, that is principally so. This is the requirement of the company 
    that the master has to maintain the schedule. Some of the passengers have 
    to reach other connections and if they miss them, because the vessel is delayed, 
    the company has to pay compensation. <br>
    <b>Q:</b> Which company has worked out the schedule? <br>
    <b>A:</b> Estline AB. But I don't blame Estline for anything. Each company 
    has its own schedule, where it is described up to the minute. If a company 
    buys a ship, then it is not completely known how the vessel reacts during 
    operation, how much power is needed, among other things, during a storm.</i></font></p>
