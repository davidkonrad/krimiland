  <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Numerous activities by the 
    Governments of the three countries involved, their various administrations 
    and other organisations took place during the early days and following weeks 
    with regard to the sinking of the ESTONIA and which were of relevance to the 
    investigations of the JAIC. Some shall be explained below. </font></p>

    Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée</b></font></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On the day after the casualty, 
    29 September 1994, Chief Inspector Åke Sjöblom and Inspector Gunnar Zahlée 
    returned from Tallinn to Sweden with their knowledge of the extremely bad 
    condition of visor and bow ramp, the incompetence of the crew and finally 
    the impossibility to stop the ferry from departing despite all their endeavours. 
    See Chapter 15. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already on the following day a confidential 
    meeting behind closed doors took place which was chaired by the then head 
    of Sjöfartsinspektionen, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, with the heads of the Stockholm 
    and Gothenburg offices of Sjöfartsinspektionen and their assistants attending. 
    Åke Sjöblom informed those assembled about his real findings and his desperate 
    but futile attempts to stop the ferry from departing. The very far reaching 
    consequences were discussed, but then it was decided to inform the public 
    that only minor deficiencies had been found, moreover that the inspection 
    had only been on-the-job training and not a real PSC. See <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    15</a>. This official version is upheld by Sjöfartsverket up to day and Åke 
    Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée have confirmed it when being questioned by police 
    and the public prosecutor. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unknown whether the members of 
    the Swedish part of the JAIC were informed during a meeting in the Sjöfartsverket 
    head office in Norrköping on 13 October 1994. It has to be assumed that Olof 
    Forssberg and Börje Stenström were informed, because otherwise it would not 
    be understandable that Börje Stenström in his capacity as chief maritime technical 
    investigator did not take part in the questioning of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar 
    Zahlée at the office of the Swedish JAIC in November 1994, which was, at least 
    officially, the only time that these two - being really key witnesses as to 
    the ferry's condition before her last departure - have been interrogated by 
    JAIC members. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Åke Sjöblom at the beginning wrote a 
    draft version of his report con-cerning the "On-the-job training on the Estonia" 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.198.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.198</a> - and did send this draft by letter of 24 October 1994 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.199.htm" target="_blank">see 
    Enclosure 15.199</a> - to Willand Ringborg being in charge of the Sjöfartsverket 
    project of the training of Estonian safety inspectors. Recently another copy 
    of this letter with two hand-written notes to Börje Stenström on it was made 
    available - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.1.443.htm" target="_blank">see 
    Enclosure 36.1.443.</a> <br>

      her from sailing on 27.09.94. </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Handwriting 
      of Åke Sjöblom.)<br>
      The 2nd note at the bottom in another handwriting reads: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If she would have been stopped on the 
      27th to correct all the 17, they would probably quite quickly have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found 
      the rest of the damages (failures) and in that case the ship would have 
      been detained for a few weeks in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estonia. 
      Best regards, L.Å."</i> </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Attached was a copy of the 
    filled-in PSC form of the Swedish National Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) 
    concerning the inspection of the ESTONIA on the 27.09.94 by Åke Sjöblom/Gunnar 
    Zahlée and their Estonian trainees. On this copy, which is signed by the "Head 
    of National Ship Inspec. <b>Division</b>" Aarne Valgma, also the 3rd column 
    referring to <i>"references to conventions" </i>is filled in, which is only 
    required in case the vessel was detained which had, at least, been the intention 
    as confirmed by the above quoted notes. Although this copy - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/15.200.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    15.200</a> - is recorded in the register of the Swedish part of the JAIC under 
    A46b, it has not been attached to the Final Report of the JAIC as supplement, 
    nor is anything of the above mentioned in this report. Instead the Estonian 
    version of this "filled-in PSC form" is attached as Supplement 223 together 
    with an explanation by the E.N.M.B. dated 31.05.96 which was translated by 
    Uno Laur into English and reads as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"It is hereby reported 
      that a Port State (PSC) training inspection was carried out by the inspectors 
      of the Estonian National Maritime Board's Ship Inspection Department (with 
      assistance of the Swedish Maritime Administration inspectors) on m.v. 'Estonia' 
      on 27.09.94. The purpose of this inspection was to obtain experience for 
      the Estonian inspectors in respect of large passenger ships and also to 
      carry out a Port State Control (PSC) of this vessel. As a result of this 
      inspection all shortcomings noted by the inspectors and instructors were 
      fixed in the "Report of Inspection in Accordance with the Memorandum of 
      Understanding on Port State Control". This Report was signed by the Head 
      of National Ship Inspection Department A.Valgma. Later on this Report was 
      used as a teaching aid on training of inspectors. The aim of this inspection 
      was not to find out the knowledge and training of the officers or crew members 
      because it is the task of other authorities. In course of discussings with 
      the ship's officers the theoretical problems of stability were not touched 
      since the inspectors were interested in technical condition and organizational 
      level of the vessel. <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Estonian version does not contain the 
      entries in column 3 and the explanation for this column at the bottom is 
      illegible. Also the references to the Swedish Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket)

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The described manipulation of the documentation 
      was a vain attempt to disguise the personal tragedy of the two Swedes who 
      had on this occasion completely failed in their professional mission. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the E.N.M.B. in the trainee 
      team - in particular Aarne Valgma - had the authority to detain the vessel 
      until repairs had been effected (see Chapter 15), whether this inspection 
      qualified as a Port State Control inspection or not <a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank">(see 
      Chapters 9.3.</a>, 15). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two Swedes had no such authority and 
      those who had in Sweden and were contacted by Sjöblom (see Chapter 15) did 
      not live up to their professional duties. The reason may be the notorious 
      lack of fantasy in bureaucrats. All they would have to do is to communicate 
      to the Estonian authorities that the vessel would not be permitted to enter 
      Swedish waters or ports in this condition. In the JAIC Report, Chapter 5.2, 
      only the following is mentioned: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"During the last day 
        in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme for Estonian Maritime 
        Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port State Control in 
        compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control 
        (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough Port State 
        Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed by 
        <b>two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. </b>The 
        exercise was documented in protocol, set up in a form according to the 
        Paris MOU. A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement. The 
        Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by the 
        Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and very 
        well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused detention 
        or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular Port State 
        Control. However, some deficiencies were noted, such as that the rubber 
        seals for the bow visor were worn, had tear marks in some places, and 
        were in need of replacement, and watertight hatch covers on the car deck 
        were open and in a condition indicating that at least one was not normally 
        closed. It was also stated during the interrogation that the Swedish inspectors 
        had experienced <b>"lack of respect for issues related to load line matters"</b> 
        in their contact with officers met during the exercise." </i> </font></p>

      Early Indications of Something Unusual </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Before turning to the direct 
      activities of the JAIC, however, attention has to be drawn to certain developments 
      in Tallinn and Stockholm throwing some light on the situation existing before 
      the last departure of the ESTONIA, and the consequences thereof: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Estonian Estline 
        Director, Johannes Johanson, told Reuters on the day of the casualty that<b><i> 
        Estline had received warnings last year that an accident might occur in 
        the Baltic Sea.</i></b> Thereafter security measures had been intensified. 
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Since Enn Neidre was 
        head of the Navigation Department of ESCO and safety adviser of Estline 
        he must have known about this threat. It can therefore be assumed that 
        he informed the other Estonian JAIC members about these threats. Whether 
        Andi Meister being - in his capacity as Transport Minister - the highest 
        representative of his country for sea safety was not already aware is 
        unknown to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Members of the intermediate 
        Estonian Commission - <a href="chapter35.htm" target="_blank">see Chapter 
        35.1</a> - were also the Managing Director of ESCO, Toivo Ninnas, and 
        the Traffic Director of Estline, Yrjo Saariinen, who definitely knew about 
        the bomb threats and presumably reported them to the intermediate Estonian 
        Commission. Both left this commission upon their own recommendation shortly 
        after its foundation. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi Meister writes 
        in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i> on page 21 among other things 
        after the wreck had been found: <i>"On the recordings of the search vessel 
        the front side of the vessel was flat and then for the first time the 
        idea came up that the waves had torn off the visor and that water had 
        penetrated the car deck via the bow ramp which was also confirmed by survivors. 
        Another possibility seemed not to exist. <b>On the other hand, a bomb 
        could also not be fully excluded." </b></i></font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The watch A.B. onboard 
        of the training vessel "LINDA", having been berthed in Tallinn on the 
        evening of 27 September 1994, told SPIEGEL TV in December 1999 that he 
        had overheard a VHF conversation between the ESTONIA and "Port Control", 
        i.e. the Harbour Master's office. "Port Control" had asked the ESTONIA 
        either shortly before or after the departure whether the search for bombs 
        had brought any result. ESTONIA's answer was: No. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Bomb threats against 
        a ferry carrying on each voyage 1000 people or more onboard is with certainty 
        a matter to be reported to the Board of Directors. It has to be assumed 
        therefore that Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Director of N&T - see 
        Subchapter 5.2 - and member of the Board of Estline was informed. It is 
        most likely that he - in turn - informed the N&T management because at 
        about the same time there were bomb threats against Silja vessels, which 
        were considered to be so serious that drastic safety measures were introduced 
        at the Silja pier in Stockholm. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It was confirmed by 
        Sjöfartsinspect's inspector Lennart Ahlberg to SPIEGEL TV in December 
        1999 that the Estonian as well as the Swedish criminal police and also 
        Sjöfartsverket were informed about these bomb threats.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In summary of the aforementioned 
        it has to be concluded that relevant governmental agencies of Estonia 
        and Sweden, and probably also Finland, especially their police organisations 
        were aware that there had been recent threats to sink ESTONIA by bomb 
        explosions and that the last threat dated 27 September, when the ferry 
        had been searched but apparently without result. It has to be assumed 
        that the JAIC members had the same knowledge as Olof Forssberg was a high 
        ranking civil servant with the Ministry of Defence and Kari Lethola being 
        part of the Ministry of Justice.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It is unknown to this 
        'Group of Experts' whether the government agencies mentioned before also 
        knew already on the morning of 28 September that there possibly had been 
        explosions onboard of the ESTONIA because the technical facilities available 
        to the Nordic countries and their partners to detect explosions at sea 
        are not the subject of this investigation.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> But the way in which 
        the JAIC members and the Finnish criminal police officers performed the 
        interrogations of the survivors does indicate that they had knowledge 
        of - at least - possible explosions onboard. The questioning of the German 
        survivor Manfred Rothe by the criminal police in Helsinki may serve as 
        an example. It was video-filmed and according to the transcript he was 
        asked among other things: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>"1. Mr. Rothe, could one think that the vessel was 
        hit by a mine?</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>2. ... and, no explosives at all?" </i>(See 
        the transcript attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.2.445.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
        36.2.445 </a>/<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/36.2.445.1.htm" target="_blank"> 
        36.2.445.1.</a>) </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> When the JAIC on their 
        first joint meeting on 29 September in Turku questioned 3 crew members, 
        among them motorman Hannes Kadak, who had been in the engine control room 
        at the time of the casualty, he was also asked the following questions: 
        </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"11. Q: Did you 
            look to the monitor? <br>
            A: Yes, I saw water on the monitor. I don't know when it started to 
            penetrate. The height of the water was above the roof of the personal 
            cars. </i></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>12. Q:<b> Did 
            you see whether the hatch burst open by explosion (was blown open)?</b><br>
            A: Don't know. Was in control room and asked: Shall we leave? Went 
            out through the watertight door. Did not close the door because certain 
            personnel stayed behind."</i></font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Upon instructions of 
      the Finnish JAIC chairman, Kari Lethola, one week after the visor had been 
      placed ashore in Hangö paint samples were taken from the areas around the 
      failed locking devices and the visor lug for subsequent examination for 
      possible traces of explosions. (See Subchapter 32.1.)<br>
      The JAIC Final Report contains on page 133 only the following: </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"The Finnish police 
          have taken several paint samples from inside the visor. TLC (thin layer 
          chromatography), LC (liquid chromato-graphy) and spot test analysis 
          of these revealed no vestiges of explosives."</i></font></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In this connection it 
      has to be noted that the explosive experts of the Finnish criminal police 
      apparently did not know that it was no more possible to prove by means of 
      the above-mentioned methods whether an object had been affected by explosions 
      which had been below water for 7 weeks. According to the explosives expert 
      Martin Volk this is only possible by a metallurgical examination of the 
      molecular structure of the affected metal. Such an examination, however, 
      was not carried out according to available information. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of the existing rumours about "possible" 
      or even "actual" explosions in the foreship area which might also have caused 
      a hole in the starboard hull - see the following Subchapter 36.3 - with 
      respective influence on the casualty scenario, the official investigation 
      was never directed in this direction. It has to be noted, however, that 
      recent photos, taken of the visor since being in Södertälje, showed that 
      a substantial part of the visor bulkhead plating around the initial location 
      of the lugs for the side locks has been cut off at both sides. Initially 
      it had only been small rectangular parts directly around the locations of 
      the lugs. </font></p>

      The "Hole in the Starboard Side"</b></font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 2/3 and 9/10 October 
      1994 ROV inspections of the wreck were carried out in the presence of Tuomo 
      Karppinen of the Finnish JAIC. The hole in the forward part of the starboard 
      hull seems to have been discovered which assumption is confirmed by the 
      many cuts of the video footage of this area. The existence of this hole 
      seems to have been known also to Sten Andersson, thus at a certain level 
      within Sjöfartsverket, as well as to the JAIC members. This fact was consequently 
      leaked out to the press, as is first shown in the article on 18 October 
      1994 in DAGENS NYHETER by Anders Hellberg, where he states: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">"Bow Visor Tore Up Holes 
        <br>
        Accident Commission convinced what caused the Estonia casualty. Estonia's 
        bow visor tore up big holes in the hull, as it was torn off. Together 
        with the partly opened bow ramp, those holes in the hull caused water 
        to flow on to the car deck in such quantities, that the stability of the 
        ship completely changed. <br>
        When the 50 to 60 ton heavy visor started to move the actuator tore traces 
        (tracks) in the plating and holes were made in the hull, says Sten Andersson, 
        observer of Sjöfartsverket in the JAIC who was not present at the Monday 
        session in Tallinn.<br>
        Also from other very well informed sources <b>DN has received the same 
        information, that holes in the hull contributed to water getting into 
        the ship so quickly</b>. According to Sten Andersson, the three visor 
        locks, two on the sides and one at the bottom, were ripped off. This can 
        be seen from the new underwater pictures taken. <br>
        The DN's source, with substantial knowledge of the ship's construc-tion, 
        has difficulties believing that the sturdy lock at the bottom - the Atlantic 
        lock - could have been ripped off by a force directed upwards. The source 
        said: "I rather believe that the visor attachments on the deck have broken 
        and that the 54.5 ton visor fell forward and broke the Atlantic lock. 
        The bow visor then started to move forward/ aft tearing on the upper part 
        of the ramp on which cars and trailers normally drive. The bow ramp hung 
        on the visor and was finally dragged out a meter or two in its upper part. 
        Here water came into car deck."<br>
        <b>Note: </b>This should be the other way round: The visor actually hung 
        on the bow ramp, but it may be a misunderstanding. <br>
        But many experts have had difficulties to believe that this compara-tively 
        small opening of the ramp would have let in such huge amounts of water, 
        that later sank the ship. More than 1000 tonnes have entered.<br>
        The two pieces of information explain how additional water came into the 
        ship. When the visor finally broke loose the hydraulic actuators, that 
        normally regulate the opening, tore big holes into the hull. The beam 
        on which the actuator was fastened has, in its turn, <b>ripped off part 
        of the hull plating. There are pictures of those damages, that we just 
        got from the new videos taken by the underwater cameras, Sten Andersson 
        says. </b><br>
        <b>Note:</b> Such pictures are not visible on the video footage publicly 
        available.<br>
        According to the source of DN this scenario gives "violent mechanical 
        damages and big holes in the hull". Those holes will then be situated 
        under the water line in the heavy sea. <br>
        Survivors have testified about several different bangs, that might explain 
        how the bow visor first came loose in its lockings from the actuator attachments. 
        <br>
        Those who stayed in the cabins under car deck in the foremost part of 
        the ship have told about a scraping from the outside of the bottom, that 
        is the outside of the ship. That sound might have been caused by the finally 
        ripped-off visor drifting along the ship's side. The new conclusions of 
        the JAIC changes the earlier picture, where the visor was ripped off and 
        the bow port was instead pushed in by the violent sea. <br>
        The question then is of course whether the crew had any possibility to 
        save the ship and alert the passengers. <b>Probably the entire course 
        of events - with the bow visor coming loose, the pushed-out bow ramp, 
        and the ripped-up side of the hull </b>- took place very quickly. The 
        officers on the bridge didn't have many minutes until so much water had 
        entered, that the ship was not possible to save. <br>
        Why, then, has not the bow visor been found in the proximity of the wreck? 
        The Finnish Coast Guard has been looking along the route close to Estonia, 
        but hasn't found anything.<b> The Commission is convinced that the visor 
        doesn't lie in the area close to the wreck</b>, where one has been looking. 
        A possibility is, that it all happened so fast that the visor simply lies 
        under the wreck and therefore will not be found until the wreck - possibly 
        - will be salvaged."</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Note:</b> Hellberg 
          obviously means damage to the ship's hull not caused by the actuators 
          when cutting through the front bulkheads and Sten Andersson's reply 
          indicates that he refers to damage by which massive water ingress on 
          to the car deck is possible. Hellberg has just a vague idea but confronts 
          Andersson with information about big damage to the hull's side. If Andersson 
          had not been aware about such damage he would have corrected Hellberg 
          imme-diately. But Andersson did not reject it and let it pass. Thus 
          it was published and stands up to day uncorrected. Hellberg furthermore 
          writes in his article that "the scraping noises heard by survivors from 
          the 1st deck might have been caused by the visor drifting along the 
          vessel's hull side" which became indeed part of the JAIC scenario. This 
          cannot have been possible because according to the <i>"Floatability 
          Calculations of the Visor"</i> by the Technical University, Hamburg-Harburg, 
          the visor sank as soon as it became detached from the vessel - <a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank">see 
          Subchapter 34.11 </a>- which was only when the vessel was heeling from 
          90° to upside down, i.e. approximately when the heel was 130°/140° - 
          <a href="chapter31.htm" target="_blank">see Chapter 31</a> - the Casualty 
          Scenario. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Although such a hole 
        could have explained the sinking and, in particular, the way the ferry 
        sank, it was completely ignored by the JAIC in their press conference 
        and in all internal and external publications. However, not all of the 
        relatives forgot about the Hellberg article in DN and especially those 
        who had made own observations which could lead towards a hole in the side 
        of the ferry remained very interested and followed this up whenever possible. 
        This occurred for example at a big meeting at Karlberg Castle on 13 March 
        1996 when Johan Fransson from Sjöfartsverket was asked whether there was 
        a hole in the starboard side. His answer was: <i>"Yes there is a hole 
        in the starboard side, but I don't know anything about it - please the 
        next question!"</i> This was said in the presence of many relatives, journalists 
        and survivors, among them Rolf Sörman, who reported on the meeting at 
        the Styrelse for Psychological Försvar (Board of Psychological Defence) 
        on 9 June 1999 when the survivors Mikael Öun, Sarah Hedrenius, Sten Jolind 
        and himself met with Johan Fransson, Per Nordström from Sjöfartsverket 
        and some people from the SPF. Rolf Sörman asked Johan Fransson again whether 
        there was a hole in the starboard side and his answer was "yes": However 
        the "hole" had disappeared to the public and was completely covered by 
        the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström and his colleagues 
        which was presented to the public. </font></p>

      The Hearing of the Survivors </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Finnish police took 
      statements of all the survivors brought to Finland - sometimes two or three 
      statements - during which one of the standard questions to the survivors 
      was: <i>Did you note or feel explosions?" </i>The Swedish survivors were 
      interviewed by local policemen in their home cities or villages, who in 
      most cases were not trained to ask the proper questions for a maritime investigation. 
      This resulted in the disappearance of valuable evidence forever, a procedure 
      which as such was accepted by the Swedish part of the JAIC as well as by 
      the investigating public prosecutor. There is evidence that SÄPO (Security 
      Police) officials tried to persuade survivors to change their statements 
      in regard to particular matters. Some followed, very few did not. All the 
      statements were in the early stage declared "classified" by prosecutor Birgitta 
      Cronier, however, were declassified sometime in 1995. The statements were 
      sent to Estonia on 17 October 1994 and were received by the Swedish part 
      of the JAIC on 20 October 1994. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Estonia the crew survivors were frequently 
      heard by the Criminal Police, the Security Police and subsequently by a 
      transport investigation office in addition to being heard several times 
      by Estonian members of the JAIC. According to the statements available the 
      Estonian passenger survivors however were heard only once. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Estonian statements were sent to the 
      Swedish and Finnish police and translated subsequently into the respective 
      languages. The Swedish versions were received by the JAIC on 1 December 
      1994 and are available together with some of the Estonian originals to this 
      'Group of Experts'. A comparison of the Estonian originals with the translations 
      revealed that the Swedish text is substantially shorter and relevant parts 
      of the originals were not translated at all. It is, of course, unknown to 
      this 'Group of Experts' whether this occurred just due to sloppiness of 
      the translator or was done deliberately. The statement of Ain-Alar Juhanson 
      taken by the Central Criminal Police of Tallinn, at Tallinn airport on 29 
      September 1994 at 17.10 hours shall serve as one of many examples: <br>
      The translation from the Estonian original reads as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"Before the catastrophe 
        I was on Deck 2 in cabin 1056 of the ferry 'Estonia'. The vessel left 
        her berth in Tallinn, at 19.00 hours. Our group consisted of 4 sportsmen. 
        Myself, Anti Arak, Kristjan Rainend, Jaak Pehk are athletes. Ülle Karo 
        was responsible for our massage. We were underway with a Mercedes bus 
        without driver. Our bus was one of the last taken on to the car deck. 
        I do not know how the bus was secured. The driver was K. Rainend who had 
        driven the bus on to the car deck. We had a double cabin but we were 4. 
        The cabin no. was 1056. Ülle Karo had bought a 1-person ticket for this 
        cabin. We four others had deck tickets. The cabin was in the middle of 
        the ship. I cannot define exactly, I was unable to orientate myself on 
        the vessel. At the moment of the catastrophe we were in cabin 1056. Myself, 
        Arak, Rainend and Ü. Karo. I do not know in which cabin Pehk was. We all 
        slept.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a high sea state prevailing. 
        The waves were beating against the vessel, there was strong wind. I woke 
        up by a heavy metal bang. I felt that the vessel heeled immediately to 
        the right side. I was sleeping on the floor. Prior to this metallic bang 
        I did not hear anything in particular due to the noises of the engines. 
        As a result of the bang we all woke up. It was clear to us that something 
        particularly extraordinary had occurred. I took my Texas trousers, my 
        shirt and left the cabin. All the passengers were already in the alleyway. 
        It appeared that some water was already in the alleyway. All four of us 
        then went up the stairs to the deck - I was the first one. The vessel 
        continued to heel to the right. On the stairs there were only few people, 
        but up at the doors it was quite full. There was full panic. Everybody 
        was screaming: "What shall we do?" At this time everywhere the light was 
        on and in my opinion also the engines were still running. Only very few 
        managed to reach the railing. Not everybody managed to get out of the 
        foyer. Myself, Arak and Rainend managed to reach the railing. After we 
        had reached the railing I heard a female voice shouting over the loudspeakers 
        2 or 3 times the word "Alarm" in Estonian language. At this time there 
        was still light. Arak and myself stayed for a while at the railing. There 
        was a strong storm. Suddenly the vessel heeled heavily to the right, the 
        heel reached almost 90°. Then we heard the siren and the light went out. 
        We climbed on to the side of the vessel and tried, depending on the heel 
        of the vessel, to have a firm hold beneath our feet. Together with us 
        many people had climbed on to the side of the vessel. Rainend did put 
        on a lifevest whilst holding on to the railing. There were many lifevests. 
        Together with Arak we tried to fabricate a raft from lifevests. We succeeded 
        but did not manage to lift the raft on to the vessel's side. There were 
        a number of rubber boats floating around in the waves. I cannot say when 
        the ship's engines stopped. Together with Arak we estimated that in case 
        we would jump into the water to reach one of the lifeboats we would be 
        smashed against the vessel by the waves coming in from this side. There 
        was a heavy storm. We then moved towards the bow. We could see that the 
        bow was damaged. At the bow I climbed along some sort of grids downwards 
        together with Arak. To the water's surface remained some 10 m and hand-in-hand 
        we jumped. We swam about 100 m away from the vessel to avoid being sucked 
        down by the vessel. Due to the high waves we were unable to save ourselves 
        on the rafts. We had both put on lifevests when we were standing at the 
        railing and now were swimming together until we saw a white cabinet. The 
        doors of the cabinet were closed. We climbed on top of it. I do not know 
        how long we were on the cabinet. We were able to hold ourselves to the 
        handles of the cabinet. In the moonlight we saw the vessel. The distance 
        was approximately 150 m. Finally we managed to reach a rubber boat. After 
        about 3-4 hours we were picked up by a helicopter. Together with Arak 
        I was rescued. I cannot say what happened to the others.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had not been on the car deck to check 
        our bus during the catastrophe." </i></font></p>

        Rainend. Ülle Karo had bought the ticket for cabin 1056. The other 4 had

        Enclosure 36.5.446.2. </a><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite obvious that the Swedish text 
        by far does not contain the information stated in the original, thus the 
        psychological expert to the Swedish JAIC Bengt Schager, who was to summarize 
        all statements for the other JAIC members and experts, was not in a position 
        to evaluate the full evidence of this important witness. He could therefore 
        not question him further about his observations at the damaged bow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that very important evidence 
        remained unknown to the JAIC. <br>
        In any event, the JAIC relied on the statements of the survivors mainly 
        taken by policemen untrained for maritime casualties and refrained from 
        the taking of own statements. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the JAIC only heard 
        a couple of the crew members whom they considered to be the key witnesses, 
        which they actually were and still are, however, they did not tell the 
        truth or, at least, not the full truth. They were - as it could be expected 
        - very loyal to their owners ESCO and N&T. The many passenger survivors 
        having made numerous valuable observations were not heard by the JAIC, 
        except for one or two. Instead the psychological expert to the Swedish 
        part of the JAIC, Bengt Schager, was instructed to make summaries from 
        available statements which were then handed to the other members and experts 
        and on the basis of which they formed their opinion about the developments 
        onboard and about the casualty sequence of events. These summaries were 
        complied in such a way that for example water observed on deck 1 was not 
        even mentioned in the first version. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kari Lethola was interviewed by Jutta 
        Rabe of SPIEGEL TV in May 1996 and was also confronted with certain survivor 
        statements, e.g. Carl Övberg, he stated that they (the Finnish part of 
        the JAIC) did not have the complete statements, but just "Summaries" made 
        by Bengt Schager. In the course of the further interview it turned out 
        that the JAIC had not taken the statements of any passengers themselves. 
        Nevertheless it turned out that Lethola knew the Övberg statement about 
        the hydraulic noises heard, which, according to Lethola, were caused by 
        the visor actuators when the visor was opening/closing after the locks 
        were broken.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Stenström the noises were 
        caused by the stabilisers. Lethola subsequently confirmed that the JAIC 
        did everything to prove in the best possible manner that the hypothetical 
        scenario developed by Stenström less than 4 weeks after the casualty is 
        the real one and that consequently the locking devices of the visor, allegedly 
        under-dimensioned, were the main cause of the casualty. In a subsequent 
        interview after his resignation from the JAIC Bengt Schager told Jutta 
        Rabe among other things: </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Q:</b> I was told 
        that you were first asked to make summaries of the statements and then 
        later again, more or less, to count statements which were talking about 
        a detailed time line, so that one could know when there was water under 
        the car deck, etc.? <br>
        <b>A</b>: Oh yes, when I made my first version we suddenly came across 
        that new things were important, on which I had not put any emphasis before, 
        for example, we have the reports about water on deck 1 and I knew there 
        were reports about water on deck 1 and I was again re-reading this in 
        a more thorough way and put it into my summary as it was said, because 
        it could prove to be important after the shipbuilders report. I did not 
        know, when I started my first version that this could be very important, 
        that the actual wording had to be put there. <br>
        <b>Q:</b> Did it affect in some way? <br>
        <b>A:</b> No, it was more ... I knew at that time that we believed that 
        the accident started with water on car deck. We had reports of small amounts 
        of water, trickles really, on deck no. 1, but then people came out publicly 
        and said that the accident started with water on deck 1 and then it is 
        obvious that I had to rewrite it in a way that is clear that the data 
        we have does not support such an idea. <br>
        <b>Q:</b> So, from the existing statements you did not get that impression? 
        <br>
        <b>A</b>: That's correct.<br>
        <b>Q: </b>You have not been able to talk to passengers who had seen water

        <b>A:</b> No. " </i></font></p>
