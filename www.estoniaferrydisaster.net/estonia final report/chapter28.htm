<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In preparation 
    of the covering of the wreck as decided by the Swedish Government already 
    in 1995 the Finnish Environment Protection Organisation and the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation began with preparations in spring 1996 to pump out the heavy 
    fuel from the bunker tanks of the ESTONIA as soon as the weather situation 
    permitted. For this purpose reportedly two sophisticated ROVs were leased 
    from Norwegian off-shore operators, which could also perform underwater flame-cutting. 
    Furthermore, the oil-pollution fighting vessel HALLI was equipped with an 
    installation able to warm up the asphalt-like heavy fuel and then pump up 
    the liquid part, a rather time consuming matter. This installation proved 
    to be very sensitive and thus work could only be performed up to wind force 
    Bft. 4, whereafter the installation had to be pulled up. In order to make 
    use of the sophisticated ROVs Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka from the Finnish 
    part of the JAIC then frequently took the chance to make further ROV surveys 
    of the wreck. A request by a member of this 'Group of Experts' for permission 
    to attend one of these ROV surveys of the wreck was categorically denied by 
    the Finns. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently a copy 
    of a video allegedly made on 19.06.96 was received which shows images of good 
    quality (PAL format and copied to PAL) of the foreship area only, although 
    the complete vessel had been resurveyed and more videos had been made which, 
    however, were not made available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The evaluation of 
    the video tape revealed that the area around the port outer ramp hinge was 
    now quite well visible without the mattresses, blankets and whatever else 
    the crew had squeezed into the gap created by the partly open bow ramp. A 
    damage hole in the port lower front bulkhead can be seen which will be explained 
    in Subchapter 29.2.Also a strong lug welded to the front bulkhead is visible 
    which was fitted by the yard for the wire controlling the bow ramp ropes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The video further 
    produced very clear images of both the port and the starboard visor hinge 
    bolts, both front bulkheads and parts of the bow ramp which improved the evidence 
    available already and which is further discussed in Subchapter 29.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon respective 
    questioning, Karppinen and Rahka advised that there were no holes in the hull 
    and that otherwise no changes to the wreck had been observed. Only later did 
    it become public that during these ROV surveys it was discovered that steel 
    plates, which the divers had previously fitted and welded over the holes cut 
    by them into the shell plating forward and aft in way of deck 1, had been 
    removed from their openings in the meantime. (Theses plates reportedly weighed 
    500 kg.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed 
    that those who removed the heavy steel covers from the openings are probably 
    identical with those who broke off the steel sheeting underneath the port 
    bridge wing - see Chapter 27. Needless to say that these facts are not mentioned 
    in the Report of the JAIC. </font></p>
