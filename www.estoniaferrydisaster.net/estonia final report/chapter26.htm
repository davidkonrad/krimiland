<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">As stated already 
  in the Chapter 24 the search for the visor was allegedly commenced on 05.10.94 
  by TURSAS and EVA-200, although at that time the visor was most probably located 
  already adjacent and/or below the bulbous bow of the wreck.<br>
  </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor 
  was finally "officially" found in position 59°23,0'N; 21°39,2'E in upside down 
  condition. The video tape from the ROV investigation is not available.<br>
  </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the time 
  from 16-18 November 1994 the visor was lifted by the Finnish multi-purpose ice 
  breaker NORDICA - assisted by the Swedish mine hunter FURUSUND - and brought 
  to Hangö - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/24.408.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
  24.408.1</a> - where it was lifted ashore and placed on the premises of Levator 
  Oy, still in upside down condition. It was left in the open air, totally unprotected, 
  but still in remarkably good condition until 20.11.99. On this day the visor 
  was picked-up by the Swedish navy and transported to Sweden. </font></p>
