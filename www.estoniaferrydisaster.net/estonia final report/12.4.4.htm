    engineer, ca. 40 years old, made about 30 trips on the ESTONIA, clearly remembers 
    frequently having heard the splashing of water inside the visor at sea; realised 
    the bad condition of the visor and of the bow ramp as well as the many cracked 
    and re-welded welding seams in way, decided not to use the ESTONIA anymore 
    when going from Stockholm to Tallinn, but to go via Helsinki instead. The

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Reference 
        is made to our earlier telephone conversation in December 1994 about observations 
        concerning the lower bow part/bow visor of "Estonia". There is a little 
        uncertainty about the exact date which could have been the 02.09.94, but 
        what can be of importance is my observation from the pilot boat. On the 
        way out to a vessel we met "Estonia", sea state was moderate, wind came 
        from ESE. "Estonia's" lower bow part was submerged in the waves and when 
        the vessel rose out of the wave-trough masses of water were streaming 
        out of the whole lower part of the bow visor, even out of the sides. This 
        was repeated many times during this meeting with "Estonia". The distance 
        to "Estonia" was ca. 75 m during the observation and the visibility was 
        good." </i></font></p>

    ex Master of DIANA II and since 1993 Stockholm pilot, as well as a number 
    of other pilots have frequently seen what Torsten Sundberg has explained in 
    his letter of 14.02.95. When ESTONIA was approaching the pilot station and 
    had reduced speed from ca. 20 kn to 7-8 kn water was pouring out of the visor, 
    also in calm sea. (See Enclosure 12.4.4.160.) </font></li>

        December 1993 I piloted "Estonia" to Stockholm at about 05.50 hrs I went 
        alongside the ferry's starboard side on board the Sandhamn pilot boat 
        inside Svångens Light, wind and sea state according to the attached copy. 
        Water covered the whole starboard side of the car deck ca. 3-5 cm high. 
        <br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
        26 December 1993 I piloted "Estonia" again, this time from Söderarm. The 
        weather was now worse, according to my own notes ca. 22 m/s from East, 
        with rough seas. I boarded the ferry about 1,5 nm outside Remmargrunds 
        Light. Upon my recommen-dation the master turned to starboard to make 
        leeway for the pilot boat. I jumped on board from the upper platform of 
        the pilot boat, the port pilot door was open. Under such conditions one 
        has to expect water splashing up from below between ferry and pilot boat. 
        This time, however, surprisingly the water came from above out of the 
        pilot door when the "Estonia" rolled to port. When I came on board the 
        mate warned me that there was "plenty of water on deck!" On the way to 
        the lift I walked through water high up the legs of my boots, ca. 20 cm. 
        <br>
        In my opinion there was 5-10 cm of water over the whole area of the vessel's 
        car deck. The water was splashing about 1 m high against the bulkhead 
        of the stairways (centre casing).«</font></i></p>

    - This witness travelled to Tallinn on board the ESTONIA on 2 September 1994 
    and returned on the following day. The vessel left Stockholm on schedule, 
    but then returned after about 30 minutes, stayed re-moored to jetty for about 
    30 minutes and then left again. This was said to be due to trying out a new 
    jetty, which everyone on board knew to be only an excuse because it was the 
    same jetty which ESTONIA was always using. Upon return to Stockholm somebody 
    from the crew (she cannot say who) said it was <i>"because of visor problems, 
    but we did not want to make the passengers nervous"</i>. Li sat in the reception 
    and did not see the visor during this incident.</font> <br>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The witness had a 
    cabin all the way down in the vessel (i.e. on the 1st deck). Whilst waiting 
    for her friend she was walking around a bit. As there had been a peculiar 
    smell on the car deck she went there to have a look. She changed her mind, 
    <b>however, because before stepping over the sill she saw that the car deck 
    was full with water - more than there would be just from deck washing. It 
    is difficult to estimate the exact height of the water, but it was in any 
    event remarkably high, so high that she could not step into it without becoming 
    quite wet.</b> The witness considered this to be strange, because the weather 
    was fine and there was no storm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The witness 
    and her friend had booked the offered sightseeing tour through the engine 
    room which, however, was cancelled without explanation.<br>

    back to Stockholm she was visiting the bridge around 20.00 hours in heavy 
    head seas, when the officer showed them the speed = full speed less 1 knot. 
    The banging against the seas was severe, so that she could not sleep. She 
    could not differentiate between water/ ship banging and metallic visor/ship 
    banging.</font></li>
