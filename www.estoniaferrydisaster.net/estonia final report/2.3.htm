<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 1979 - subsequent 
    to the previously described series of 6 ferries - the DIANA II (Hull No. S 
    592) was delivered to the Viking Line partner, AB Slite, Stockholm. Not only 
    the tonnage of 11 700 GRT but also the fitments of this vessel demonstrate 
    the speedy development of ferry-shipping in this part of the world, which 
    became known as the 'Baltic phenomenon'. Both DIANA II and her near-sister, 
    the following newbuilding from Meyer Werft VIKING SALLY, were products of 
    the 'Baltic phenomenon' and considered to be trend setters for the ever growing 
    'jumbo' ferries in this trading area. (See further Chapter 4.)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <b><font size="4">2.3.1</font></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b><font size="4">Newbuilding 
  contract and approval procedure</font> </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As far as could be 
    ascertained DIANA II was designed by the Stockholm consulting office Simson 
    Ship in close co-operation with AB Slite and Meyer Werft as an enlarged version 
    of the predecessors APPOLO and DIANA. According to the newbuilding contract 
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.5.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.3.1.5</a>) 
    - written in German - Meyer Werft was inter alia obliged to build the vessel 
    according to SOLAS 1974. Consequently, an upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck at the minimum distance from the forward 
    perpendicular as required by SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 9, was imperative. 
    Exemptions could be granted by the National Maritime Administration of the 
    flag state - in this case the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - should the vessel operate 
    exclusively in "sheltered waters", i.e. not more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land (SOLAS 1974 - Chapter II-1, Rule 1 (C) ). The position of Sjöfartsverket 
    in this respect has already been explained in this report in the preceding 
    Chapter 2.2. It reveals that the bow ramp was accepted by the National Maritime 
    Administration as the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The same refers to 
    Bureau Veritas according to the memo concerning a discussion in the BV-Hamburg 
    office on 23 June 1978 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.3.1.6.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.3.1.6</a>). This office is responsible for the plan approval of vessels 
    built in Germany to B.V. classification rules. In this memo it is stated under 
    item 1: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The collision 
    bulkhead has to be extended up to the C-deck by a watertight ramp. The location 
    of the ramp as to the forward perpendicular can be determined by means of 
    the geometrical means in the obliquity. Agreement with B.V. and the Swedish 
    Maritime Administration.« </i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, the 
    building files reveal that the Yard subsequently endeavoured to obtain this 
    agreement directly from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket. This was basically done 
    verbally in discussions and/or telephone conversations, which, however, were 
    recorded in the diary of the Meyer Werft project manager H.Wahnes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">So it is stated for 
    example in a note dated 23 October 1978 under item 2: <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»K.S.S. collision 
    bulkhead.«<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Note: K.S.S.

    2.3.1.7</a>). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In a further memo 
    dated 20 November 1978 it is stated inter alia :<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - H. Sjöholm was 
      then the manager of the Rotterdam office of Sjöfartsverket and DIANA II 
      was built in his area of responsibility.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- C.B. Myrsten 
      was the owner of AB Slite and Mr. Kure was his technical adviser.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> By the above quoted 
    notes of project manager H.Wahnes it is documented that: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">a) According to 
      an agreement with Bureau Veritas and Sjöfartsverket the collision bulkhead 
      was to be extended above bulkhead deck to C-deck by means of a watertight 
      ramp, the location of which was to be determined by the geometrical mean 
      in the obliquity (freeboard-deck = car deck = A-deck).<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b.) In the 
      presence of the owner, C.B. Myrsten, and his technical consultant Kure, 
      it was discussed and agreed by the representative of Sjöfartsverket, Sjöholm, 
      that the bow ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
      above bulkhead deck, i.e. as such there was a deviation from the requirements 
      of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 
    hindsight the cited documentation in respect of such an important deviation 
    from the SOLAS 1974 requirements appears to be meagre. The following, however, 
    has to be considered:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The Yard had 
      already delivered 6 vessels of similar design to the same owners trading 
      in the same service for which also DIANA II was built. Upon application 
      of the owners to the National Maritime Administrations of the respective 
      flag states these had issued - without problems - the 'Passenger Ship Safety 
      Certificates', thereby confirming that the vessels complied with 'SOLAS 
      1974' requirements.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the 
      same manner the National Maritime Administration had dealt with a large 
      number of other car/passenger ferries in the Baltic. This was in conformity 
      with the 'General Scandinavian Practice' described in the preceding Chapter 
      2.2.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the 
      'pre-computer age' it was uncommon to confirm every agreement in writing. 
      Verbal agreements and handwritten notes or memos were accepted and honoured.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is the considered 
    opinion of the members of this 'Group of Experts' that on basis of the above 
    explained notes/memos in connection with own knowledge and experience the 
    deviation from SOLAS 1974 in regard to the location of the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck was approved by the competent 
    Swedish Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket - already in the planning 
    stage of the vessel in accordance with accepted customs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After all, this 
    is confirmed by the fact that the 'Sjöfartsverket' upon delivery of DIANA 
    II issued to her owners the 'Passenger Ship Safety Certificate' (PSSC) and 
    has, ever since, renewed it annually without a trading restriction and without 
    issuing an Exemption Certificate. The PSSC valid at the time of the ESTONIA 
    casualty was issued on 10.06.1994 by the Malmö office of Sjöfartsverket and 
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..3.1.9.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    2.3.1.9.</a> The certificate was signed by chief inspector Åke Sjöblom who 
    also inspected ESTONIA during her last afternoon in Tallinn (see Chapter 15). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The locking devices 
    of the visor and bow ramp were calculated by the subcontractor von Tell AB, 
    Gothenburg and - most probably - also by the Yard. Although the von Tell archive 
    in Gothenburg - subsequently taken over by Kvaerner Shipsequipment AB - contains 
    considerable design and calculation material concerning DIANA II, the respective 
    calculations relating to the locking devices of the visor and bow ramp are, 
    however, missing. - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.25.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.25.</a> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time when 
    these calculations were made, i.e. in 1978, the B.V. Rules still did not contain 
    any specific requirements for the dimensioning of the locking devices for 
    visors of Ro-Ro vessels in general and also not for car/ passenger ferries 
    in particular, and although B.V. classed Ro-Ro vessels had had a number of 
    serious bow door incidents in previous years - see Chapter 33 - for example:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Swedish flag 
    STENA SAILOR, commissioned only in 1973, broke the locking devices of her 
    bow door already on 16.01.74 and called at a port of refuge. The subsequent 
    investigation by Sjöfartsverket revealed that sister-vessels had had similar 
    incidents before and that the locking devices were underdimensioned for the 
    loads to be absorbed. Since Sjöfartsverket as well as the other maritime administrations 
    of the Nordic countries were lacking technical staff and facilities to carry 
    out load calculations themselves, this was delegated to a number of acknowledged 
    Classification Societies, among them B.V., who had to do these calculations 
    anyway, respectively had to check the calculations performed by the Yard and/or 
    its subcontractor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sjöfartsverket informed 
    B.V. about the results of the STENA SAILOR incident investigation, viz. that 
    the locking devices of this less than one year old vessel had been too weak. 
    B.V. replied at the end of July 1974 that it was their intention to increase 
    the requirement for the locking devices of bow doors. Since Sjöfartsverket's 
    internal system at that time did not contain a follow-up of such promises, 
    it was apparently left to the respective class of a vessel, in this case B.V., 
    to determine the strengthening of the locking devices and it was not cross-checked 
    by Sjöfartsverket whether this had really been carried out (see Investigation 
    Report of Magnus Sjöberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.3.116.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.3.116</a>).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was the situation 
    in 1978 when DIANA II - including the locking devices of her bow visor - was 
    designed and subsequently approved by B.V. </font></p>
