  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is nearly impossible 
    to reconstruct the exact casualty scenario, in particular because the key 
    witnesses from the crew did not yet tell the truth. In order to get as close 
    as possible to reality a sequence-of-events has been developed which is based 
    on</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the observations 
      and the noise scenario according to the survivors' statements as explained 
      in Chapters 20/21 and </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the damage 
      to wreck and visor as outlined in Chapters 29/30.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the condition 
    of the ESTONIA upon departure from Tallinn - see Chapter 19 - and the apparent 
    fact that the ferry was still in normal condition when she was observed by 
    the Polish Ro-Ro vessel AMBER at about 23.30 hours were taken into consideration 
    as were the positions and conditions of wreck and visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This sequence-of-events 
    has been reconstructed by means of a model of the damaged foreship including 
    the bow ramp and the damaged visor. Photos made of the decisive stages are 
    incorporated into the casualty scenario on the following pages, which has 
    been amended by drawings whenever considered necessary. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The scenario starts 
    with the condition of the ferry upon departure from Tallinn at about 19.30 
    hours on the 27th September 1994. The departure condition is demonstrated 
    by drawings and text below.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the bow ramp 
    had been closed as tight as possible by means of a tarpaulin at the top and 
    a mooring rope in the winch drums - see Chapters 16/19 - and further, after 
    the bolt of the Atlantic lock had been hammered by crewmembers through the 
    3 bent and misaligned lugs on the forepeak deck - see the footprints in the 
    visor on Sheet 9 - Chapter 30 - the ferry quickly picked up speed when she 
    followed the westbound lane in the TSS between the island Nayssaar and the 
    mainland. Due to the missing and/or defect rubber packings on the forepeak 
    deck - see Sheet 7 in Chapter 29.2 - the inside of the visor quickly filled 
    with water to the outer level. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water level 
    inside the visor was raising the deeper the bow was pitching into the waves 
    coming in from port forward. Simultaneously water penetrated to the car deck 
    at the port lower side of the bow ramp in spite of the "sealing material" 
    stuffed into the big gap by the crew. - See drawings on the following page 
    1051.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the end 
    of the TSS off Suurupi Lighthouse the course was changed to 262° and the ferry 
    proceeded with all 4 main engines on full output along the Estonian North 
    coast. Due to the increasing south-westerly gale the ferry heeled 2-4° to 
    starboard and was pitching harder and harder. - See Chapter 30. Passengers 
    started to feel unwell and several became seasick.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1051.jpg" width="480" height="638"></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even with 
    calm sea the water level inside the visor was rising above the 3rd stringer<br>
    when the vessel was at full speed. The lower side of the bow ramp was below<br>
    3rd stringer level, thus even in clam sea the water from the visor was penetrating<br>
    the gap in the bow ramp and was flooding onte the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the course of 
    the following 1 - 1,5 hours the bow was diving increasingly deeper into the 
    wave troughs and finally the foreship was shipping green water onto the forecastle 
    deck. Therefore, it has to be assumed that the visor had been filled up with 
    water up to the 1st stringer level or even higher. This means that the weight 
    of the visor increased from 55 ts to approximately 200 ts which had, among 
    other things, the effect that the 0,5 m stern trim might have been reduced.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the 
    high water column inside the visor and the respective pressure on the unsecured 
    ramp the port lower corner of which being plugged with "sealing material" 
    the water quantities penetrating the gaps and streaming onto the car deck 
    were increasing and accumulating at starboard to which side the vessel was 
    continuously heeling since departure the scuppers at the starboard side being 
    most likely unable to swallow all the water streaming into the car deck. To 
    avoid the worst the crew seems to have opened the starboard stern ramp slightly 
    and have kept it in such condition by means of the ice braking cylinders against 
    which the ramp was pressed by the actuators to maintain the gap through which 
    water was flowing from the car deck. The resulting high pitch hydraulic noise 
    created by the aft hydraulic pumps disturbed the conference held on the 4th 
    deck above to such an effect that it had to be closed down at about 20.45 
    hours. -See the statement of Rolf Sörman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.335.1. </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The approximate condition 
    - existing onboard since about 20.45 hours - is demonstrated by the drawings 
    on page 1054 ff.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since some 
    time already low metallic banging noises had been noted by several passengers 
    throughout the ship but, in particular, by those in the foreship area and 
    in the sauna located on the 0-deck. See the statements of Mikael Öun - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.224.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    17.2.224</a> / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.2.225.htm" target="_blank">17.2.225</a>. 
    At 23.30 hours ESTONIA passed the AMBER with very high speed, pitching severely 
    in high seas from forward directions and taking green water onto the forecastle 
    deck and spray all over the vessel. See the statement of the AMBER watch officer 
    - Enclosure 20.237. </font></p>

    20.45hrs. the aft hydraulic pumps were started on the STB. stern ramp opened 
    slightly.<br>
    2. Due to the stern trim and the STB. heel of the ferry the water penetrating 
    through the improperly<br>
    closed bow ramp streamed off the car deck through the slightly open STB. stern 
    ramp.<br>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Due 
    to increasing wave height and deep pitching of the ferry the water level inside<br>

    3. The ferry made very hard pitch movements.<br>
    4. The bow ramp was kept more or less closed by the rope and the water pressure 
    from the<br>
    visor side, however water penetrated at both sides of the ramp<br>
    5. This was the condition on board the ESTONIA when she met &quot;AMBER&quot;.</font></p>

    Many passengers heard low metallic banging caused by visor moving within play<br>
    of locking devices due to misaligned visor, damaged stempost and missing rubber 
    packings. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The watch officer 
    of the AMBER saw ESTONIA the last time at about 23.30 hours in the radar and 
    apparently did not see anything abnormal as he would otherwise remember it. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The track of the 
    ESTOINA during the last hour before reaching the waypoint is unknown although 
    big deviations were not possible due to the distance to be covered in the 
    short time available.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about 00.30 hours 
    on 28 September 1994 the waypoint was reached and the course was changed 25° 
    to starboard to 287°. The vessel began to roll in addition to heavy and hard 
    pitching, because wind and sea came now about 4 points from the port side. 
    The approximate condition of the ferry is demonstrated by the drawings following.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A little later the 
    stabilisers were activated from the bridge, but it appeared that the starboard 
    one did not move out of its pocket which was located about midships on 0-deck 
    level. Sometime later the crew seems to have started to work on that stabiliser 
    and have tried to hammer it out by means of sledge hammers. See the statement 
    of Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about 00.40/45 
    hours 1-2 heavy bangs, crashed were felt when the watchman A. B. Silver Linde 
    came again to the car deck and must have seen big quantities of water moving 
    between the cars and trucks, with personal cars already floating around in 
    the forepart of the deck. Due to the heavily and hard labouring vessel there 
    must have been heavy movement of the water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Silver Linde alarmed 
    the bridge at once by walkie-talkie shouting that there was much more water 
    on the car deck and they had to leave the vessel. This was overheard by safety 
    officer Ervin Roden, who had his walkie-talkie switched on when he was in 
    his cabin - see statement of Paula Liikamaa <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.352.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.4.352.</a> The watch officer certainly informed the master who most likely 
    told him to send the boatswain with some deckhands down to try to rectify 
    the situation. Most likely the chief mate and the chief engineer were also 
    called to the bridge and the 2nd mate Peeter Kannuussaar sent down to the 
    car deck as well, which would be the normal procedure.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the very weak 
    condition of visor and bow ramp were with certainty known to the vessel's 
    command, the speed was reduced and the bow slowly turned to starboard in an 
    attempt to reduce the load on the visor and to avoid green water on to the 
    forecastle deck, because crew members had to work also there and had to enter 
    the port side house from there as it was certainly not possible to reach the 
    control panel from the centre casing. It was necessary for crew members to 
    get to the forward port side of the car deck to the control panel to activate 
    the hydraulic pumps in order to close the bow ramp best terms possible and 
    probably also to hold the visor down hydraulically. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel made slower 
    but deeper pitch movements due to the speed reduction, but the rolling increased 
    dangerously when the vessel got into or almost into beam seas. To reduce the 
    rolling the ferry was turned back to port. The vessel was again in head seas, 
    the heavy rolling stopped, but the deep pitch movements increased again and 
    green water was taken on the forecastle, whereafter the crew had to abandon 
    their attempts to close the bow ramp by heaving the mooring line. The bow 
    ramp was then held by the actuators which, however, could only close the ramp 
    to a final opening of about 5 cm. Thus water continued to stream onto the 
    car deck and there was nothing the crew could do about it. It has to be assumed 
    that the nautical advisor, Captain Juri Aavik, was also on the car deck/on 
    the forecastle deck doing his utmost to get the situation under control, however 
    in vain. It has further to be assumed that the 2nd mate and/or the boatswain 
    informed the bridge continuously about the situation on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Simultaneously the 
    engine crew was working on the starboard stabiliser fin and sledge hammer 
    noises were heard all the time. A further consequence of the vessel pitching 
    against high seas from forward was the load increase on the visor attachments 
    which had already been increased by about 150 ts of water moving forward/aft 
    and side to side inside the visor. This caused the failure of the starboard 
    visor hinge followed by the failure of the starboard side lock of the visor. 
    - See the drawings on page 1062. Both components were considerably pre-damaged 
    - see Subchapters 12.4.3/12.5 and Chapters 29/30 - and the load carrying capacity 
    was substantially reduced. See also Subchapter 34.4. The Atlantic lock remained 
    intact for the time being.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The 
    crew members went on the forecastle deck through the door on deck 5 and</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">tried 
    to heave the rope holding the bow ramp which failed probably due to the green 
    water taken on the forecastle deck.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The bow was held 
    by the actuators and lowered down inside the visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The crew somehow 
    managed to start the hydraulic pumps under extremely difficult conditions 
    due to the water on the deck and the moving cars.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.The substantially 
    pre-damaged STB . Visor hinges failed followed by the equally pre- damaged 
    STB side lock.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. 
    The starboard side of the visor moved forward, the lugs cut through the deck 
    plating and struck against the deck beam aft frame 159, the visor was pushed 
    back when the vessel was diving into the next wave trough causing the broken 
    visor hinge parts to smash against the hinge parts on the forecastle deck.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard side 
    of the visor was 5-7 cm moving forward/aft between the deck beam at frame 
    159 and the hinge parts on forecastle deck which created the heavy metallic 
    banging noises scaring many passengers. The lug plates underneath the starboard 
    visor arm came in contact with the adjacent plating and sustained scoring 
    marks on the inside and on the outside because the vessel was only slightly 
    heeled to starboard, still pitching in head seas and only slightly rolling. 
    The port visor hinges remained intact for the time being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the disappearing 
    hydraulic pressure the bow ramp was lowering down into the visor and was resting 
    on the vertical beam of the inner visor structure with the centre flap in 
    between. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After some minutes 
    apparently also the port hinges failed and the whole visor was now moving 
    forward/aft between the deck beam at frame 159 and the hinge parts on the 
    forecastle deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The now prevailing 
    situation is illustrated by the drawings on the following pages. The dynamic 
    forces created by the deep pitch movements of the vessel in combination with 
    the movement of the big water quantity inside the visor and the weight of 
    the visor finally resulted in the lug plates underneath the visor arm to cut 
    through the deck beam at frame 159. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lugs quickly
