<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was built 
    as a lengthened sister vessel of DIANA II on the basis of a specification 
    dated 5 September 1979 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.11.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.11</a>) with General Arrangement Drawing No. 5675/79 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2..4.1.12.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.12</a>) attached thereto, both of which had been developed in close 
    co-operation between AB Sally, Mariehamn and Meyer Werft. Specification and 
    General Arrangement Plan No. 5675/79 were finally made part of the building 
    contract signed on 11 September 1979 by the owners and the Yard (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.13.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.13</a>). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the Building Contract 
    required the Yard to build the vessel in conformity with the requirements 
    of SOLAS 1974 the initial set of drawings contained a "partial collision door" 
    (upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck) 
    at a location according to those requirements. Reference is made to part of 
    a drawing dated 20.12.79 with the edges marked yellow at both longitudinal 
    bulkheads where the "partial collision door" was planned to fit in at frame 
    150 - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.14.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.14</a>). Part of the General Arrangement Plan - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.15.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.1.15</a> - shows what was actually built for the following reasons:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already 
    during the negotiations of the building contract agreement was reached concerning 
    the function and location of the bow ramp. This is revealed in a telex sent 
    on 30.08.79 by Peter Motikat of Meyer Werft to Alf Johansson of AB Sally - 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.16.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.16</a> - where it is stated under item 6:<br>
    <b><i>»6. Bow and stern ramp arrangements according to DIANA II.«</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Peter Motikat 
    was negotiating the building contract on behalf of Meyer Werft, whilst Alf 
    Johansson was negotiating on behalf of AB Sally, then owned by the Johansson 
    family.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As it was the intention 
    to build the foreship of both vessels identically the location of the bow 
    ramp and its relevance as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    bulkhead deck was consequently therewith established. This is revealed also 
    from item 3123 of the specification, where it is stated: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow 
      Ramp One watertight bow ramp with longitudinal stiffeners arranged to give 
      a free opening of 5.5 m width and 5.0 m height. In lowered position, the 
      bow ramp to reach minimum 1.5 m forward of bulbous bow's front. At the end 
      of the ramp hinged flaps to be arranged. The bow ramp cannot be operated 
      if the bow door is not in open position.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also during the negotiations 
    with these owners the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck had been discussed. The yard management knew from the simultaneous negotiations 
    concerning the conversion of VIKING 4 into EARL GRANVILLE (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.17.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.17</a>) that the English Maritime Authorities, DOT = Department of Trade, 
    as well as Lloyd's Register demanded the installation of the upper extension 
    of the collision bulkhead at the location required by SOLAS 1974 before the 
    vessel was permitted to operate under English flag. During the conversion 
    the upper extension was installed as "partial collision door" at the location 
    required. Consequently Mr. Motikat informed Alf Johansson accordingly offering 
    the installation of a similar "partial collision door" on VIKING SALLY and, 
    as a matter of fact, the installation was included in the original quotation. 
    Alf Johansson, however, stated to have the agreement of F.B.N. to comply also 
    in the case of VIKING SALLY again with the 'General Scandinavian Practice', 
    i.e. bow ramp = upper extension of collision bulkhead and no separate "partial 
    collision door" required. Mr. Motikat insisted on having this agreement entered 
    into the building specification, where it can be found under item 3123:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
      »Partial Collision Door For the intended service not required by F.B.N.«</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' 
    is therefore convinced that it had been the wish of owners, and was approved 
    by the Classification Society as well as by the National Shipping Administration, 
    F.B.N., already during the planning stage of the newbuilding that the bow 
    ramp should act as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck, although its location did not comply with the respective requirements 
    of SOLAS 1974.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection 
    attention is drawn to the fact that the installation of a "partial collision 
    door" had been included in the initial quotation with DM 45.000,--. This amount 
    was subsequently credited to the owners as revealed by an entry in the 'More/Less' 
    list of project manager H.Wahnes (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.18.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.18</a>). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the 
    'More/Less' list all items differing from the quotation are listed for final 
    discussion with the owners. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the position 
    of the bow ramp of ESTONIA did not satisfy the SOLAS requirements for an upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead an exemption certificate should have been 
    issued on the condition that the vessel in the course of its voyages did not 
    proceed more than 20 nautical miles from the nearest land. This was the intention 
    when the ferry was built and actually she sailed in "sheltered waters" with 
    certainty for the first 101/2 years of her life. According to Germanischer 
    Lloyd it was common practice in the early 1980's not to issue exemption certificates, 
    but a respective remark was made in the PSSC. It was said to be only in 1985/86 
    that IMO required the issuance of exemption certificates in case the National 
    Maritime Administration made use of the right given to them by Rule 1(c) respectively 
    Regulation 1.4 preceding each SOLAS chapter, viz. to exempt owners from compulsory 
    obligations in case the vessel did not proceed more than 20 nm from the nearest 
    land in the course of her voyage, i.e. remained in "sheltered waters". Consequently 
    from the point of view of the newbuilding yard, nothing more could be done.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This 'Group of Experts' 
    has also investigated the reasons why the location of the wheelhouse on VIKING 
    SALLY is different in comparison to DIANA II. The General Arrangement Plan 
    No. 5675/79 dated 05.09.79, and being part of the building contract, still 
    shows the wheelhouse in the same location as on DIANA II, i.e. above the front 
    of the superstructures. In the specification - also being part of the building 
    contract, however it is already stated on page 4-16 under item 4513 - Wheelhouse 
    and Chartroom - inter alia: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Yard investigates 
    to arrange wheelhouse 11 m to stern.« Owners had thus already at an early 
    stage considered having the bridge installed somewhat further aft. According 
    to Mr. Bernard Meyer this, as well as the altered shape of the funnel, is 
    to be attributed to the proposal of a Finnish architect who wanted to give 
    the vessel a better silhouette with these changes. Against additional costs, 
    Meyer Werft carried out both changes according to the wishes of the owners 
    and with the approval of the class and the F.B.N. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the new location 
    of the bridge it was no more possible to see the forecastle deck, i.e. the 
    bow visor from the middle of the wheelhouse, the command centre of the vessel. 
    Therefore at both sides in way of the connection between wheelhouse and closed 
    wings one window was installed just above the floor of the wheelhouse. Through 
    these windows the forward part of the visor was visible. In addition, at the 
    top of the visor a flag pole was installed with a blue light fitted on top 
    which was shining aft only. This flag pole with the blue light also acted 
    as a steering aid for pilot, watch officer and helmsman. This installation 
    cannot be found in the specification of the building contract as the decision 
    to move the location of the bridge aft was made only after signing of the 
    contract.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to 
    the presence of the flag pole with aft-shining blue light on top, up-and-down 
    movements of the visor would have been very well visible from the bridge in 
    the darkness unless the light was defect. - See page 110. Upon inspection 
    of the visor in Hangö the flag pole was found broken from the visor, but it 
    is still connected to the visor by means of the cable and is hanging below 
    its initial position underneath the visor. (Visor is resting on steel blocks 
    in upside down position.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The change 
    of the bridge location was approved by the Classification Society as well 
    as by the F.B.N., as can be seen from part of the drawing 1116 "Arrangement 
    of Top Lanterns" - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.1.19.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.1.19</a> - which was approved by Sjöfartsstyrelsen (F.B.N.) on 09.01.80.
