    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here the JAIC describes 
      in detail which inspections were carried out by Port State Control and the 
      surveyor of the Classification Society "in line with common practice and 
      requirements". The JAIC has always known positively that neither the visor 
      nor the forward ramp of the vessel were weather- respectively watertight. 
      (See Subchapter 38.2.) The JAIC was at all times furthermore aware, that 
      the vessel - on the route Tallinn-Stockholm - did not comply with stringent 
      SOLAS requirements with regard to the position of the upper extension of 
      the collision bulkhead above main deck. (See Subchapter 6.5.2.) Such deficiencies 
      render any such vessel unseaworthy without any further debate. If the inspectors 
      appointed by the Swedish government to execute Port State Control or the 
      surveyor of the Classification Society overlook such deficiencies then such 
      behaviour is not considered to be "in line with common practice and requirements" 
      amongst reputable members of the shipping community. It is furthermore noteworthy 
      that the JAIC in this Chapter describes the delivery drydocking in Turku 
      "in 1993" without any mention of the Repair List issued by the former owners 
      and known to the representatives of the new Owners. (See Subchapters 6.5. 
      and 12.5. and Supplement 231 to the JAIC Report). This list - as described 
      in detail in Subchapter 12.5 - contains the root of all the deficiencies, 
      the further worsening of which later led to the catastrophe. Given this 
      fact, hardly any interested reader will consider the following casual remark, 
      which can be found in Chapter 3.3.6., to be a satisfactory description of 
      the problem:<br>
      <i>"Just before transfer to Estonian flag by the end of 1992 attention had 
      been given to the strength of the ramp and visor locking devices and a quotation 
      for reinforcing them had been requested by Wasa Line. However, nothing was 
      made to the locking devices." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">8. JAIC Chapter 
    3.3.5 : </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC states here (page 
      42, middle column): <br>
      "It has been stated that the lower locking bolt on the port side of the 
      ramp sometimes failed to go to fully extended position. The standard procedure 
      was then to retract the bolt and again command it to locked position, whereby 
      it would normally go to fully extended position and the green indicator 
      lamp would come on." <br>
      Evidently the lower port locking bolt of the bow ramp could not engage the 
      mating pocket at the ramp side and consequently also not contact the sensor 
      because the port side of the ramp was misaligned by ca. 21/2 inches = 10 
      cm (diver's statement 2.12.94 - see Subchapters 27 and 29.2) which had the 
      consequence that neither the upper port bolt nor the port ramp (pull-in) 
      hook of the bow ramp were able to engage their respective mating pocket/mating 
      lug. The cause for this severe misalignment was the collapse of the port 
      outer ramp hinge - see Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 - by which the lugs connecting 
      the ramp with the vessel slid off the pin respectively broke. This had been 
      known to the technical managers and the crew since several weeks before 
      the casualty and the crew had - according to Börje Stenström - Enclosure 
      12.5.166 - frequently asked for repairs by putting this item on the repair 
      list. Although these circumstances - as stated above - rendered the ESTONIA 
      unseaworthy they are not mentioned in the Final Report. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">9. JAIC Chapter 
    3.3.6:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Here we read: <i><br>
      "After transfer to Estonian flag no more service work was carried out by 
      the MacGregor service base in Turku as the regular maintenance was carried 
      out by the ship's crew and, according to the new owners, no need for external 
      service had developed. New rubber seals had, how ever been ordered. It was 
      known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point where corrective 
      action would be needed." </i><br>
      In this respect reference is made to Subchapters 12.4 and 12.5 where the 
      observations of the many previous passengers are reported. Contrary to the 
      statement of the new Owners, upon which the JAIC apparently relied, many 
      repairs were carried out both to visor and bow ramp parts, partly with heavy 
      burning and welding. There were frequent problems with opening of the locking 
      devices of the visor and/or the bow ramp after arrival in Tallinn which 
      sometimes made it necessary to tow the ferry away from the berth, turn her 
      around and berth her again stern first. This subsequently created very substantial 
      difficulties for the trucks to turn around and leave the car deck.<br>
      As stated by witnesses the lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt 
      off and subsequently rewelded. In this text reference is also made to the 
      divers' report - see Chapters 29.2 and 30 - who stated when inspecting the 
      lugs of the side locks still in the wreck that only a very small piece of 
      (white) visor bulkhead was attached to the lug, otherwise there were only 
      very thick welding seams. Nevertheless there were rectangular holes of the 
      size of the lugs in the visor plating which means that the lugs were since 
      some time before the casualty not welded anymore to the visor plating but 
      only stuck through the existing rectangular holes and then spot-welded from 
      outside and/or inside which explains the extraordinary thick welding seams 
      on the lugs. Thereby it was possible for the crew to adjust the lugs to 
      the changing distance between visor-platings and vessel-platings which increased 
      due to the growing misalignment of the visor. These very obvious deficiencies 
      have apparently not been investigated by the JAIC at all and consequently 
      also not taken into consideration when calculating the remaining load carrying 
      capacity of these lugs. Instead the JAIC based their calculations on newbuilding 
      standard. The JAIC continues further on page 43:<br>
      <i>"Minor routine welding repairs had been carried out on the mating boxes 
      for the ramp locking bolts whilst the ship was in service in the Gulf of 
      Bothnia." </i><br>
      Actually when the vessel was in service between Stockholm and Tallinn the 
      top plates of these mating boxes were frequently burnt off by crew members 
      when they were unable to disengage the bolt after arrival at Tallinn. Subsequently 
      the plates were rewelded. Reportedly this was also done after the last arrival 
      on the morning of 27 September 1994 when the starboard upper mating box 
      had been burnt open but the plate had obviously not been rewelded because 
      the box is still open with no sign of the top plate. See Chapter 29.2. <br>
      <i>"Local welding of a crack in a stiffener underneath the mounting platform 
      for the port side visor actuator has been noted."</i> <br>
      Actually the two lugs by the port visor actuator were found to have been 
      in the following condition:<br>
      - The outer stiffener had been very poorly repair-welded some considerable 
      time before the casualty. <br>
      - The inner stiffener was no more the original one since it did not show 
      any protective coating and it was only spot welded to the deck - if at all. 
      All stiffeners however were fully welded to the deck by the shipyard during 
      newbuilding, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation. 
      <br>
      For details see Chapter 30 - pages 990-1002. The JAIC continues further 
      on the same page: <br>
      <i>"One of the visor hinge pins had, according to verbal information, a 
      tendency to move out of position, breaking away the locking plate. This 
      was repaired once at the Finnboda yard by pushing the hinge pin back in 
      place and drilling for new locking bolts.<br>
      No other repair was, according to available information and extensive search, 
      carried out during the lifetime of the vessel on or in the areas of the 
      various operating and locking devices for the ramp and the visor." </i><br>
      This is wrong for the following reasons: <br>
      - According to the statement of the long-term chief officer Stig Lindström 
      (( January 1996) one of the visor locking devices had to be strengthened 
      some time before the sale - see Enclosure 3.4.101 and in the Swedish JAIC 
      register D11.<br>
      - The JAIC was made aware of several statements of truck drivers that the 
      lugs of the side locks were frequently burnt off and that the ESTONIA berthed 
      sometimes stern first in Tallinn in July, August, September 1994 because 
      visor and/or bow ramp could not be opened upon arrival, but subsequently, 
      after certain repairs could be operated again.<br>
      - Truck drivers have also directly reported to the JAIC that the port side 
      of the bow ramp was severely misaligned, was actually hanging down and could 
      not be properly closed since some time before the casualty.<br>
      - Truck drivers have also reported to the JAIC that securing bolts could 
      not be opened and therefore the top plates of the mating boxes at the ramp 
      were burnt off. <br>
      - Passengers/truck drivers have furthermore directly reported that the ferry 
      after having berthed bow first in Tallinn, was subsequently towed back and 
      turned by tugs and subsequently berthed stern first whereafter the trucks 
      could leave the car deck only with difficulties which reports have made 
      available to the JAIC.<br>
      - The JAIC has in its possession a video film made by a passenger upon departure 
      from Tallinn on 17.09.94 which clearly shows that the starboard visor hinge 
      had been repaired very badly with disastrous effect on the load carrying 
      capacity.<br>
      - The as-found condition of the bushings and hinge plate parts of the starboard 
      visor hinge arrangement confirms the above. <br>
      The JAIC also neglected the old damages in the visor, apparently caused 
      when the ESTONIA was used as an "ice breaker" and was forcing ice barriers 
      several meters high at full speed according to passenger information, which 
      are known to the JAIC. See Chapters 12.4.2 and 30.<br>
      Also the very fresh footprints on the 3rd and 2nd stringers of the visor 
      were not explained in the JAIC Report although the last JAIC chairman, Uno 
      Laur, has stated that they were created by crew members when they went down 
      to hammer open or close the bolt of the Atlantic lock before arrival and 
      after departure from Tallinn. The reason was the impossibility to open/close 
      the bolt hydraulically because the visor was that much misaligned and the 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were that much deformed. See Enclosure 12.5.175.

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Interim Passenger 
      Ship Safety Certificate (PSSC) was false. It confirms that the vessel fulfils 
      the SOLAS requirements, which however it did not in respect of the location 
      of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead. On the ESTONIA this was 
      the bow ramp, which was positioned too much forward. Since the Tallinn-Stockholm 
      route - contrary to the Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm route - leads more than 
      20 nm away from the nearest land, no exemption was permissible. The "partial 
      collision door" initially offered by Meyer Werft but rejected by AB Sally 
      against a credit of DM 45.000,00 should have been installed prior to taking 
      up the Stockholm-Tallinn service. This was not done and thus the ferry did 
      not comply with the SOLAS requirements and consequently the PSSC confirming 
      this was false. The JAIC finds it appropriate to explain the failure of 
      Bureau Veritas in the issuance of the false PSSC with words, that stem from 
      Bureau Veritas, namely:<br>
      <i>"When Bureau Veritas surveyed the vessel for change of flag this was 
      done in accordance with the requirements to the extent of a periodic survey, 
      which did not include examination of construction drawings. The location 
      of the extension of the collision bulkhead was thus not considered during 
      this survey."</i><br>
      It is doubtful, whether a periodic survey did suffice (see Subchapter 6.5.2.) 
      and it may also be debated whether inspection of the structure of a passenger 
      ship does not also include a check of the design drawings. The essential 
      point in this case is that Bureau Veritas had accompanied this vessel since 
      its birth and hence perfectly well knew her design. Their own form for the 
      Survey Report as a prerequisite for the issuance of a PSSC demanded the 
      inspector to check the structure of the vessel! (See Subchapter 6.5.2). 
      The same is true for the Load Line Certificate, allegedly issued on 9 September 
      1994, which confirmed that the vessel complied with the requirements of 
      the International Load Line Convention. This the vessel did not for the 
      simple reason, that its hull was not closed watertight against the seas 
      at its bow. Both parts of the double security to ensure this state, namely 
      the visor and the ramp, were not watertight. See Chapters 12.4.3 and 12.5.

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here the following comments 
      seem to be appropriate: At the time of the casualty a new Trim and Stability 
      Booklet was not yet available, but was still in progress, therefore the 
      PSSC and Load Line Certificates were issued only interim and B.V. had to 
      carry out Load Line Surveys every 3 months. In relation to the Trim and 
      Stability Booklet valid at the time of flag change which had been approved 
      by the F.B.N. on 20.01.91 the JAIC states among other things: <br>
      <i>"The Commission has noted that at the inclination test, the ship's centre 
      of gravity was positioned to starboard to such an extent that the port side 
      heeling tank was filled with about 115 t more water than the starboard tank 
      in upright condition. The load cases in the trim and stability manual, however, 
      include the heeling tanks as being either both empty or both full.</i>" 
      <br>
      Such a condition did not exist during the initial inclination test performed 
      in the presence of Gunnar Edelman of the F.B.N. on 21.06.80 in Papenburg 
      and it was unknown what had caused such unfavourable weight distribution 
      101/2 years after delivery. <br>
      Had the JAIC investigated this matter and not left it as mystery, they would 
      probably have found the same answer as this "Group of Experts", namely a 
      hole in the underwater hull which opened a tank or void space to the outside 
      and thereby permitted the creation of unknown weights in the vessel. (See

      It has been stated before, that this statement is not only untrue, but that 
      it has also been made with full knowledge of it not containing the truth. 
      This Group of Experts is not the only one to say so.<br>
      Last - but not least - the chairman of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' 
      Association, Captain Christer Lindvall, has frequently condemned the findings 
      of the JAIC. With good reason. <br>
      The JAIC further comments on the "Port State Control" carried out until 
      shortly before the last departure: <br>
      <i>"During the last day in Tallinn the vessel was used in a training programme 
      for Estonian Maritime Administration surveyors in the conducting of a Port 
      State Control in compliance with the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on 
      Port State Control (see about Paris MOU in 9.1). The trainees made a thorough 
      Port State Control inspection of the ESTONIA and were supervised and instructed 
      by two senior inspectors from the Swedish Maritime Administration. The exercise 
      was documen-ted in protocol, set up in a form according to the Paris MOU. 
      A copy of this protocol is included in the Supplement." </i><br>
      With regard to the inspection and the protocol reference is made to SUBCHAPTERS 
      34.1 and 36.1. Evidently several different versions of this protocol do 
      exist with the knowledge of Sjöfartsverket and the JAIC.<br>
      <i>"The Swedish inspectors leading the exercise have been interrogated by 
      the Commission and have stated that the vessel was in good condition and 
      very well maintained. They found no deficiencies that would have caused 
      detention or other serious remark, if the inspection had been a regular 
      Port State Control." </i>Contrary to the statement the Swedes have actually 
      tried to prevent the departure of the ferry after having detected the many 
      serious deficiencies which are noted in the protocol registered in the files 
      of the Swedish JAIC under A 46 b - see Enclosures 15.200 - see Chapters 
      15 and 36.1. <br>
      The JAIC continues: <br>
      <i>"However, some deficiencies were noted, such as that the rubber seals 
      for the bow visor were worn, had tear marks in some places, and were in 
      need of replacement, and watertight hatch covers on the car deck were open 
      and in a condition indicating that at least one was not normally closed. 
      It was also stated during the interrogation that the Swedish inspectors 
      had experienced "lack of respect for issues related to load line matters" 
      in their contact with officers met during the exercise." </i><br>
      Whichever protocol is the correct one, they all contained deficiencies rated 
      17, which means that they should have been mandatorily remedied before departure. 
      The protocol contained in the Supplement to the JAIC Report (Enclosure 15.200) 
      contains no less than 7 of such deficiencies, none of which was remedied 
      before departure. <br>
      In a telephone conversation after the hearing of Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar 
      Zahlée by the Swedish JAIC between Bengt Schager and Åke Sjöblom, the latter 
      did state, that the ESTONIA and her crew were the worst that he had ever 
      experienced. </font></p>

      that would be described by experts as a <i>"loading condition that was normal 
      for the route"</i>. The contrary is true. A passenger ship with unknown 
      weights of abt. 200 mts leading to an undefined list of abt 10 degrees, 
      which cannot be compensated by filling of the opposite heeling tank is - 
      on this count only - unseaworthy and should under no circumstance be put 
      to sea. <br>
      The JAIC also does not mention that according to eye witnesses from the 
      "SILJA FESTIVAL" the ESTONIA passed the breakwater with half open visor 
      towards the open sea. The respective statement was found in the files of

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC create the impression 
    that they have actively participated in the interrogation of survivors, which 
    was not the case. JAIC members and experts have only questioned one passenger 
    - Pierre Thiger - and some of the crew members, whom they considered to be 
    key witnesses. However, the questioning of a witness simultaneously by six 
    or seven persons can hardly be called an "interrogation". The psychological 
    expert to the Swedish JAIC, who wanted to interrogate all the important witnesses 
    separately, including the passengers, was precluded from doing so by Olof 
    Forssberg, with the exception of the purser Andres Vihmar, whom he questioned 
    alone. The statement is not available. This means that the JAIC questioned 
    the following crew members only: </font></p>

        System engineer Henrik Sillaste <br>
        Trainee officer Einar Kukk <br>
        Purser Andres Vihmar (only by Bengt Schager)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> and decided already at 
      a very early stage to rely almost exclusively on the statements of 3rd engineer 
      Margus Treu and A.B. Silver Linde as far as the casualty scenario is concerned. 
      As demonstrated in Subchapter 21.2. the numerous statements of these gentlemen 
      are better evaluated with utmost care and when doing so another consideration 
      should be taken into account. It is a fact well known in the shipping community, 
      that crew members generally tend to be very loyal to their owners and, as 
      a matter of fact, it has been confirmed by Börje Stenström to a member of 
      this 'Group of Experts' that the Swedish and Finnish JAIC members and experts 
      were very much aware, that the Estonian crew members were lying when it 
      came to the most crucial parts of their evidence. Nevertheless the frequently 
      changing statements of Margus Treu and Silver Linde became the essential 
      evidence for the casualty scenario developed by Börje Stenström one week 
      after the casualty. <br>
      The JAIC goes on to state:<br>
      <i>"Police interrogations in languages other than Swedish have been translated 
      into Swedish and this Summary is based on the Swedish text."</i><br>
      It has been described in Subchapter 36.5 that the statements of Estonian 
      survivors taken in Tallinn in the Estonian or Russian languages had for 
      example not been completely translated into Swedish and that therefore important 
      details were missing. Therefore the summaries of the survivors' statements 
      contained in the JAIC Report are to a certain part based on incomplete translations. 
      It also has to be mentioned that most of the Swedish and Finnish survivors 
      were questioned by policemen not trained to interrogate witnesses of marine 
      casualties. Therefore most important details did not come up in the course 
      of the questionings, because the relevant questions were never asked and 
      thus did not become part of the JAIC investigation and cause consideration 
      at all. Chapter 21 and the numerous statements by survivors as attached 
      to this Report demonstrate the scarcity of the database of the JAIC Report. 
      <br>
      There are indications that the Estonian Commission members as well as the 
      Estonian security police and other government bodies had frequently spoken 
      to the crew members, in particular to Margus Treu and Silver Linde. It is 
      unknown whether these questionings were recorded, but at least, recordings 
      are not available. </font></p>

      in Subchapter 21.2.2 the statements of this crew member are constantly changing 
      to the extent, that this witness must be regarded as excluded from any further 
      consideration of this accident. It can be said with certainty, that<br>
      - Silver Linde had not been on the car deck on his last round;<br>
      - Silver Linde had never seen whether all the control lights for visor/bow 
      ramp were still green, because the control panel was locked and the boatswain 
      had the key; <br>
      - Silver Linde had not been back to the bridge at around 01.00 hours, because 
      he was then already in the crew accommodation; <br>
      - Silver Linde had never been at the Reception to ask for the car deck doors 
      to be opened, because these doors were not locked; <br>
      - Silver Linde had never been on his way down to deck 1 after the starboard 
      heel, because he was then in the crew accommodation area (probably to fetch 
      his relevant personal belongings such as passport, money and the like). 
      All this is revealed from either his own testimony or the testimony of passenger

      Treu's timing is about 15 minutes late when he states that the heel was 
      about 45° at 01.30 hours, whilst the vessel was actually already on the

      Kadak stated that the heel was about 50 degrees when he and Sillaste left 
      the engine control room and that the light went out and came back when they 
      were at the Emergency Exit between decks 5/6 (Sillaste said the same) and 
      further, that the heel was 90 degrees when they reached deck 8. Actually 
      the heel was about 40 degrees when the auxiliary diesels/generators stopped 
      and power disappeared for a short while until the emergency generator started 
      to generate power to a limited number of consumers including all the emergency

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> It has to be mentioned 
      that the survey vessel "SUUNTA" stayed in Hangö during the 28th when the 
      weather was relatively bad and the wind speed was 16/18 m/s. On the 29th 
      and the 30th the wind speed was just 12 m/s, however, "SUUNTA" departed 
      only on 30th at 08.40 hours from her berth to the casualty position, which 
      was, of course, known by the Utö and the "MARIELLA" radar observations. 
      She commenced the search at 16.27 hours and found the wreck at 17.32 hours 
      on 59°22,92'N; 21°41,06'E, which is the actual wreck position. She dropped 
      a buoy and returned at 18.45 hours to Hangö. <br>
      Consequently the real position of the wreck was known to the Finnish authorities 
      from the very beginning, and with certainty also to Kari Lethola. Nevertheless, 
      he reported 59°23,0'N; 41°43'E by fax to Olof Forssberg on the same evening 
      and, furthermore, Sjöfartsverket took up in their tender specification for 
      the diving investigation sent out to various contractors in Northern Europe 
      a wreck position which is 2100 m to the NNE of the actual one.<br>
      As for the further mysteries surrounding the fairly simple task of finding 
      a wreck the size of ESTONIA at just 80 m of depth, the reader is referred 
      to Chapter 24. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The Report does not state 
      that the diving survey described here was not the first ordered by the Swedish 
      Government. The JAIC furthermore just spends a few lines on this major operation 
      carried out by very professional contractors on behalf of Sjöfartsverket. 
      The evaluation of the video tapes presented to this Group of Experts show 
      that this operation was conducted simultaneously with another diving investigation 
      by other divers. Since it has to be excluded that this second operation 
      could be carried out without the divers and the operators and supervisors 
      on board of the diving support vessel "SEMI I" noting it, it has to be concluded 
      that this other diving operation was also performed with the approval of 
      or by Swedish governmental authorities. It is noteworthy, that no tapes 
      or written documentation of this second operation have ever been released 
      by the Swedish authorities to the public. They are however available. It 
      has further to be mentioned that the Finns obviously tried to hide the presence 
      of Tuomo Karppinen onboard - see Chapter 27 - the reason probably being 
      the attempt to leave the responsibility for the many obvious mistakes made 
      with Börje Stenström being the only "official" participant on behalf of 
      the JAIC. <br>
      These mistakes were:<br>
      - the failure to instruct the divers to search the bridge properly for bodies 
      and identify the bodies by means of their uniforms (or not wearing uniforms 
      at all);<br>
      - the failure to have the front bulkheads, the longitudinal bulkheads and 
      the recesses on both sides of the bow ramp, the locking devices of the bow 
      ramp and the ramp hooks examined properly by the divers; <br>
      - the failure to have recovered at least the port visor hinge bolt with 
      bushing, the lugs of the visor side locks and the whole bow ramp with hinges, 
      just to mention the most important items;<br>
      - the failure to have examined by the divers why the starboard stern ramp 
      was open;<br>
      - the failure to have the starboard side of the wreck above the mudline 
      including the starboard stabiliser video filmed and properly recorded; <br>
      In summary it has to be concluded that the wreck examination by the JAIC 
      was carried out very poorly and insufficiently which is also reflected in 
      the description of the damage to the wreck in the following chapters.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The damage in the bow 
      area is allegedly summarised in the drawing 8.1 on page 120. This is misleading. 
      <br>
      The drawing does not show<br>
      - the damages mentioned above, i.e. the cracked off starboard front bulkhead 
      and the large holes in the longitudinal bulkheads; <br>
      - the missing and damaged rubber packing of visor and bow ramp; <br>
      - the cracked off outer starboard girder of the bow ramp, just to mention 
      a few examples, instead <br>
      - pounding damage is indicated where is no such damage; <br>
      - the port outer and inner hinges of the bow ramp are indicated to have 
      failed, which they did but some time before the casualty; <br>
      - "deep indentations" are just indicated at the lower part of the bow ramp, 
      i.e. in way of the contact area with the forepeak deck, in case the ramp 
      should have been fully open, although all transverse girders up to the flaps 
      are very heavily distorted in way of the centre line.<br>
      In summary the JAIC again indicates existing or non-existing damage the 
      way it fits their casualty scenario. Missing rubber packings, cracked open 
      bulkheads and distorted, cracked off girders, which obviously cannot have 
      been caused during the hypothetical casualty scenario of the JAIC are either 
      not mentioned or misinterpreted. <br>
      Some details: <br>
      - The JAIC states that the visor parking devices (harbour securing) were 
      undamaged, but do not state that they were open (this means that there had 
      to be "one red light" on the control panel when it was allegedly checked 
      be Silver Linde - see Chapter 21.2.2.). <br>
      - The JAIC states that "the opening in the front bulkhead on the port side 
      had rather clean cut contours", which is true, however the JAIC does not 
      state that the starboard front bulkhead was completely ripped open from 
      the inside to the outside, that a green painted deck piece is sticking in 
      the opening and that the starboard side corresponding to the photo at Fig. 
      8.2 is just a big black hole of the size that the diver could crawl into 
      it. <br>
      - The mounting bracket for the locking-bolt position sensors, in short the 
      sensor plate of the Atlantic lock, was found to be empty with corroded screw 
      holes indicating that the sensors had been dis-connected some time before 
      the casualty; <br>
      - The sensor cables were clearly cut - not torn - all of which is not mentioned 
      in the JAIC Report. Moreover the sensor plate as well as the cables had 
      been cut off by the divers in December 1994 and thrown away to the sea bottom, 
      thus disappeared forever, under the eyes of Stenström. There was indeed 
      substantial damage to the rubber seals and flatbar housings in the "corner 
      of the mouth", however not or rather limited to the forepeak deck. <br>
      - Pounding damage was noted in way of the stempost area, but only to a very 
      limited extent to the edges of the forepeak deck. <br>
      - The bulbous bow does not only show scratch marks, but 3 partly deep indentations 
      indicating very heavy contact because the bulbous bow is a very strong structure.

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">30. JAIC Chapter 8.5.3 - 
    Visor Damage :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> At first the JAIC describes 
      the big indentation in the starboard shell plating of the visor in a misleading 
      way creating the impression that it was only one indentation, although there 
      are actually two, i.e. the upper part is of older and different characteristics 
      and the lower larger part is extending into the older upper part as can 
      be seen in Figure 8.5. The JAIC uses repeatedly the term "pounding" when 
      describing the damage to the visor bottom and alleged damage to the edges 
      of the forepeak deck, although the visor bottom is severely distorted and 
      pressed in which occurred obviously when the visor had moved that wide forward 
      that the stempost area was extending the forepeak deck and thus had lost 
      its carrying function. As a result the forepeak deck was pressed into the 
      visor bottom with the visible result. The only "pounding" which actually 
      occurred was within the play of the locking devices. This had created the 
      low banging noises heard by many passengers before the casualty on this 
      voyage and also already on previous voyages. <br>
      On pages 122/123 of the JAIC Report the visor and parts of it are shown 
      on 7 photos (Figure 8.4 - 8.10) in a very particular way. <br>
      Fig. 8.4 shows the visor looking from aft to forward and starboard to port. 
      The picture shows the damage to the port inner longitudinal bulkhead and 
      the deep indenta-tion on the port side of the upper cross beam. Both damages 
      can be seen in more detail on Figure 8.7. What is not shown is the opposite 
      port side: There is absolutely no damage, i.e. the starboard inner longitudinal 
      bulkhead does not even show scratches in the paint and the port side of 
      the upper crossbeam just shows paint scratches. The explanation for this 
      damage being restricted to the port inside of the visor is the apparent 
      fact that the vessel was considerably heeled to starboard when the lugs 
      underneath the visor arms (visor lugs) broke through the front bulkheads 
      of the vessel and did not support the visor any longer against moving to 
      starboard. The visor fell for about 100 mm to starboard until the port inner 
      bulkhead of the visor was resting on the bow ramp then lying inside the 
      visor already on the vertical and crossbeams. This impact caused the up 
      to 360 mm deep indentation on the port inner bulkhead of the visor. There 
      is corresponding damage in way of the port upper side of the bow ramp - 
      see Chapters 29, 30, 31 (Casualty Scenario). <br>
      Figure 8.7 also shows the port inside of the ramp house with the last two 
      of nine frames of the aft part of the ramp house bent. That is to say that 
      actually only the last frame (P4) at port side was pressed together while 
      the next one (P3) is only slightly indented, the next one (P2) even less 
      and P1 just shows a slight contact mark and the remaining frames towards 
      the starboard side are unaffected. See pages 955 ff. in Chapter 30. <br>
      Figure 8.9 does not show the starboard side (outside) of the port, but of 
      the starboard actuator attachment lug (visor lug) with deep scorings and 
      green (deck) paint marks indicating frequent forward/aft movements of the 
      visor when the visor was tilted down by different angles. The JAIC does 
      not show pictures of the inside (port side) of this starboard lug and also 
      not from inside and outside of the port visor lug, thereby depriving the 
      reader of the possibility to draw conclusions from the conditions of these 
      lug plates as to movements and tilting angles of the visor. The respective 
      pictures are shown in Chapter 30 on pages 973 and 996. It reveals that both 
      the outsides and insides are deeply scored at starboard side, though differently, 
      i.e. much more and deeper at the outside and at the inside only one main 
      scoring line almost parallel to the forecastle deck. <br>
      At port the outside of the visor lug plates is totally unaffected, i.e. 
      not even paint scorings, while the inside is very deeply scored, almost 
      engraved indicating forward/aft movement of the visor at varying tilting 
      angles. <br>
      The obvious fact that the starboard outside and the port inside of the lug 
      plates were most severely scored leads to the conclusion that the vessel 
      was already heavily heeled to starboard when the hinges broke, first at 
      starboard and subsequently at port, because the obvious fact that the port 
      outer lug plate is not scored at all indicates that the vessel must have 
      been heeled to starboard already quite considerably when the port hinges 
      broke because there was no contact between the lug plate and the deck/deck 
      beam. <br>
      Figure 8.8 shows damage below the recess for the port locating horn which 
      was obviously caused by the port locating horn at a time when the port hinges 
      were broken already, because the visor was in raised condition as otherwise 
      the locating horn would be resting deeper and higher in the recess as confirmed 
      by the contact marks at both sides of the recess. <br>
      Figure 8.10 shows the big visor lug being part of the Atlantic lock installation. 
      It shows the bore to be elongated, but it cannot be seen that the hole lug 
      is bent to starboard, it almost cracked off the visor bottom, obviously 
      when the visor moved the above explained ca. 100 mm to starboard, a very 
      strong indication that the Atlantic lock was at that time still intact. 
      The JAIC picture also does not show the flame cut-off part of the lug with 
      two deeply penetrating cracks having started in one of the burning marks. 
      For details see page 1028. <br>
      Figure 8.11 shows a rather foggy picture of the port outer bow ramp hinge 
      (the JAIC has crystal clear pictures in particular from this area) which 
      is again described in a misleading way. The lines allegedly point to "rags" 
      are actually pointing at a thick blue mattress at the upper side and the 
      bed-cloth at the right which were put there by the crew as "sealing" material 
      because there was a gap of some centimetres between bow ramp and bulkhead 
      in this area since the hinge had failed several months before the casualty. 
      The bolt is visible in a declined condition much too far to starboard. The 
      brown lug visible at the upside slipped off the bolt several months before 
      the casualty where after the other one broke. The JAIC is wrong when stating 
      that the aft deck plating of the visor had heavy pounding marks. Just in 
      the recesses at the port and starboard side there are some contact marks, 
      otherwise there are no indications of pounding in way of the deck plating.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>31. JAIC Chapter 8.5.4 
      - Ramp Damage </b>corresponds to Chapter 29.2, item 6. <br>
      The JAIC writes: <br>
      <i>"The condition of the ramp was inspected primarily from its lower side 
      due to the limited access to the upper side." </i><br>
      This is wrong. The ramp was accessible at the upper side as well as the 
      lower side, from the inside and from the outside. The divers went everywhere 
      - even inside, i.e. the car deck side - and everything is on video. <br>
      The JAIC writes:<i> "The 2 port side hinges at the bottom the ramp were 
      torn apart"</i>, thereby creating the impression that this occurred during 
      the casualty. This is wrong. The heavy port hinge should have been renewed 
      already in January 1993 according to the specification of the last Finnish 
      crew of the vessel. See Subchapters 3.4/6.5.1. This was ignored by the new 
      technical managers N&T and nothing was done. As time went by the bolt of 
      the port outer hinge worked itself more and more to starboard, broke the 
      securing plate and, finally, the outer lug connecting the ramp to the vessel 
      via this hinge bolt, slipped off the bolt which caused the failure of the 
      inner lug as well. The ramp was no more connected to the vessel at the port 
      outside, a gap of some 20-30 mm occurred which increased. See memo about 
      the discussion with Stenström in October 1995 - Enclosure 12.5.166. The 
      car deck was open to the at sea always water-filled visor. According to 
      Stenström the damage was frequently put on the repair list, however, repairs 
      were rejected by N&T. It is unknown when the port inner hinge of the bow 
      ramp broke, however according to the damage picture it might well have been 
      sometime before the casualty. The two starboard hinges of the bow ramp are 
      just elongated. <br>
      The JAIC writes: <i>"Both hydraulic actuators for the ramp had failed in 
      their piston rod end eyes, i.e. at the ramp attachments points."</i> That 
      is correct, however, the starboard piston rod broke twice, once in the eye 
      and another time between eye and piston. <br>
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The actuators were in partly extended position as 
      when the ramp is partly open."</i> This is wrong. The starboard actuator 
      is not visible at all. Its opening in way of the recess of the starboard 
      front bulkhead is almost covered by the bow ramp resting on the recess and 
      what is visible is torn and deformed. The JAIC fails to mention that the 
      starboard landing of the bow ramp to which the attachment points were fitted 
      was completely torn open (inside to outside) and severely distorted. The 
      port actuator is visible inside its housing in slightly open condition. 
      On one video it is completely inside the housing, on another one it is slightly 
      extending to the outside - see pages 836, 837. Apparently the divers did 
      change the condition of this actuator. Also inside this housing an angle 
      iron is visible which obviously had been pressed into the bulkhead plating 
      in way of the lower side of the opening. See Chapter 29.2 - item 6 - pages 
      832, ff. <br>
      The JAIC writes that the<i> "wires preventing the ramp from falling down 
      to the forepeak deck had detached from the lugs on both sides of the ramp"</i>. 
      That is true, both ramp lugs are intact and without wires, which are however 
      both still connected to the attachment points at the upper car deck opening. 
      The starboard wire is full length visible to the intact lug with shackle 
      and bolt attached. The bolt is apparently intact and screwed into the shackle 
      which raises the question who did unshackle the wire from the ramp lug and 
      screwed the bolt again into the shackle? Needless to say that all this is, 
      of course, not mentioned in the JAIC Report. <br>
      The JAIC:<i> "The ramp port side beam was damaged in several places, mostly 
      towards the top end"</i>. Meant is probably the port outer vertical girder, 
      which is only slightly damaged at its bottom part between the lower and 
      the next upper transverse girders. It is also possible that the JAIC means 
      the damage at the port upside, outside of the ramp which was caused when 
      the visor was resting on this part of the ramp. <br>
      The JAIC: <i>"The lugs for the pull-in hooks were twisted."</i> Actually 
      both lugs are intact, i.e. not broken, but heavily bent away from the location 
      of the pull-in hook and on the ROV video from 09.10.94 there are two wooden 
      pallets visible which jammed in between the bulkhead recess and the bow 
      ramp in way of the landing of the lug for the pull-in hook. On the diver 
      videos from December 1994 these pallets were no more at this location, which 
      means that the bow ramp must have been opened and closed. <br>
      The JAIC continues:<i> "The hooks themselves could not be inspected closely." 
      </i>This is wrong. The port hook arrangement including actuator is fully 
      visible on the available videos and was also checked by the diver Dave Mawston: 
      <i>"There is a latching mechanism." </i>The port hook is in its initial 
      position and intact which means that it cannot have been engaged before 
      the casualty respectively if it was engaged upon departure Tallinn it must 
      have been opened at sea before or during the casualty. The starboard hook 
      is not in its initial position, where it should be is a big black hole. 
      <br>
      The JAIC continues: <i>"The boxes on the ramp side bars, mating the bolts 
      of the ramp side cleats were twisted to open position except for the lower 
      port side one." </i>This is wrong: None of these mating boxes were twisted 
      to open position, i.e. the port upper one was completely intact but just 
      slightly bent upwards, the port lower one was completely intact with a rope 
      wound around it, the starboard upper one was intact with the upside missing 
      (had been burnt off upon arrival in the morning of 27 September 1994 by 
      flame cutting when the crew was again unable to disengage this securing 
      bolt). Obviously there had been no time to re-weld the cut off part to the 
      box before the last departure. See also chapter 12.5. Finally the starboard 
      lower box was completely smashed together in a way that the bolt was unable 
      to enter the box. This damage was apparently caused earlier when the ramp 
      had been closed when the bolt was already extended. <br>
      In addition attention has to be drawn to the reports of diver Dave Mawston 
      when checking the ramp. He found that the extended bolts at the port side 
      of the ramp were about 21/2 inches = ca. 100 mm below the respective mating 
      boxes, i.e. none of the port side bolts could anyway have engaged their 
      mating boxes and this is apparently also the reason why the port pull-in 
      hook had not engaged its mating lug. All this was obviously due to the very 
      severe misalignment of the whole ramp and its disastrous consequence - nothing 
      of it is mentioned by the JAIC. </font></p>

      Lock (The Atlantic Lock) : JAIC:<i> "The remains of the attachment lugs 
      and the locking bolt were removed from the wreck during the diving operation 
      for close investigation." </i>The locking bolt was brought up by the divers 
      but thrown back into the sea by Stenström, thus it could never be<i> "closely 
      investigated"</i>. Nevertheless the JAIC writes: "Only a slight variation 
      in diameter was measured at the contact area between the bolt and the visor 
      lug. No other damage to the bolt was noted." <br>
      This is wrong. Although the bolt is not available for close examination 
      the following can be concluded from the quite good video footage:<br>
      - there were two contact areas indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully 
      closed, sometimes only partly; <br>
      - the vertical steel bracket fitted to the bolt was bent to port and showed 
      heavy hammering marks at its edges; <br>
      - the two lugs, between which the piston rod was connected to the bolt by 
      pin, were bent outwards, i.e. away from each other, and also showed heavy 
      hammering marks. <br>
      The reason for these damages were the problems the crew had with closing 
      and opening the bolt which did not function any more hydraulically since 
      some months before the casualty because the lugs were severely deformed.

    The Visor Actuating Arrangements :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The explanations of the 
      JAIC concerning the failure of the port actuator foundation, called bottom 
      mounting platform, is confusing and partly wrong. The initial construction 
      and the damage picture of the foundation is explained in detail and illustrated 
      by several photos on pages 990 ff. of this Report. The summary reads as 
      follows: <br>
      <i>"(1) The outer stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old 
      temporary repair with very poor welding seams in its forward part. Due to 
      the corrosion visible on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this 
      improper repair was carried out already some considerable time before the 
      casualty. <br>
      (1) The stiffeners show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward 
      and the aft ends of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonable assumed 
      that the stiffeners were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. 
      The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty 
      due to load changes during the opening and closing of the visor. <br>
      (2) The B-deck was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the 
      stiffeners. This fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck 
      remains. <br>
      (3) The port inner stiffener was no more the original one since firstly 
      it did not show any protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded 
      to the deck -if at all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the 
      deck by the shipyard during new-building, as it can still be seen on the 
      starboard actuator foundation. <br>
      (4) The load carrying capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably 
      reduced." </i><br>
      The JAIC explanations about the failure of the starboard actuator is accepted, 
      however except for the following remarks by the JAIC: <br>
      <i>"The lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams showed 
      indentations and scoring on the forward and starboard side faces (Figure 
      8.9). The sealing arrangement around the deck openings for the actuators, 
      consisting of rubber seals supported by steel flat bars, was compressed 
      over most of the surface and some paint marks showed that the hinge arms 
      had been in limited contact with the deck plating." </i><br>
      The <i>"lugs for connecting the actuators to the visor deck beams" </i>were 
      called <i>"actuator attachment lugs" </i>in the previous Chapter 8.5.3 and 
      were actually the pair of lugs underneath the port and starboard visor arms 
      (called visor deck beams by the JAIC) by means of which the actuators were 
      connected to the visor. The condition of the lug plates, i.e. starboard 
      outside: deeply scored, starboard inside: slightly scored: port outside: 
      no contact marks at all: port inside: very deep scorings; has been explained 
      and commented under Chapter 8.5.3 above and needs not be repeated. <br>
      The JAIC is also wrong when stating that <i>"the rubber seals supported 
      by steel flat bars (around the deck openings for the actuators) were compressed 
      over most of the surface" </i>because this is the case only at port side 
      where the rubber seals were indeed distorted apparently by rubbing. See 
      pages 996 ff. The starboard side rubber seals are, however, unaffected. 
      See pages 973 ff. The forward parts of the port and starboard lug plates 
      show contact marks without paint at their upper parts, which were apparently 
      caused when the lug plates were cutting through the forecastle deck plating. 
      Below these areas there is more or less unaffected or just slightly affected 
      white/red paint at starboard side all the way down, but at port side there 
      are further contact areas without paint. <br>
      Bearing in mind the strong deck beam at frame 159 which the lugs at both 
      sides reached after only 120 mm of 8 mm forecastle deck plating were easily 
      cut through and which was evidently cut through at both sides, it is difficult 
      to believe that this was performed by the above explained foreparts of the 
      two starboard and two port lugs. Calculations revealed - see Chapter 34.12 
      - that weight and forward momentum of the water-filled visor were theoretically 
      able to cut the deck beam, however the damage picture of the cutting tools 
      - the lug plates, and in particular, the starboard ones, do not confirm 
      this. <br>
      This problem has been closely examined by The Independent Fact Group, Stockholm, 
      who more or less proved that the lugs could not have cut the deck beam, 
      however, do not offer a reasonable solution but leave that to a new investigation.<br>
      As to the starboard side the possible explanation is outlined in Chapter 
      32 - Unexplained Evidence - because there are several indications that a 
      powerful explosion occurred also inside the void space above B-deck, which 
      blew open the front bulkhead and possibly also destroyed the deck beam in 
      question before the hinges broke. <br>
      At the port side, however, there are no such indications. Here the answer 
      might be that the deck beam was cut by the piston rod of the partly extended 
      actuator. The piston rod is made of high tensile steel. See Figure 8.25 
      in the JAIC Report. <br>
      Finally the remark of the JAIC that<i> "some paint marks showed that the 
      hinge arms (now the "visor deck beams" are called "hinge arms" to confuse 
      the reader even more) had been in limited contact with the deck plating"</i> 
      has to be totally rejected because not even the primer is affected.<br>
      Note: This "contact" between the undersides of the visor arms and the forepeak 
      deck in front of the deck openings for the actuators has been one of the 
      strongest arguments in favour of the JAIC casualty scenario presented in 
      the Part-Report published already early April 1995. The argumentation of 
      Stenström then was that "as soon as the visor bottom was compressed deeply 
      enough due to repeated up/down pounding of the visor the underside of the 
      visor arms did rest on the forepeak deck and due to the leverage created 
      the hinges broke". This was proven to be wrong and the above is the rest 
      of this line of argumentation and even that is wrong. </font></p>
