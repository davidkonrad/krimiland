<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">He is the 
    only survivor of those having been on duty on the bridge. His main task was 
    to go security rounds through out the vessel from deck 8 down to deck 0 via 
    three check points on the car deck. One round, which he normally commenced 
    30 minutes after the full hour, took between 25 and 30 minutes. He carried 
    a walkie-talkie with him.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was initially 
    the intention of this 'Group of Experts' to ignore the different statements 
    made by <b>Silver Linde </b>completely because his "evidence" had obviously 
    been influenced by his ESCO superiors, in particular by Enn Neidre, the head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO and safety adviser of Estline and simultaneously 
    member of the Estonian part of the JAIC until April 1996, whereafter he remained 
    to be an expert to JAIC. An example of this is Silver Linde's interview by 
    the JAIC at the so-called "Landvetter meeting" on 31 March 1995, which Enn 
    Neidre, in spite of strong objections by the Swedes and Finns, had insisted 
    on attending by pointing to his membership in the Estonian part of JAIC. He 
    actually attended in a blue captain's uniform, which he had never done before 
    and never did thereafter. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The questions/answers 
    below stated are quoted from the protocol of the meeting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Commission</b>: 
    <i>"Please tell us about your last round."</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Silver Linde:</b> 
    <i>"I came down to the car deck in the middle, went aft at first, turned the 
    key, walked forward towards the ramp, a couple of meters away from the bow 
    ramp heard strong crashing noise, I told the bridge by walkie-talkie about 
    the noise and got the order to remain and check what it is all about. I stayed 
    there for 5 minutes and controlled in the vicinity, what I could see. After 
    that I opened the doors in front of the panel and all lights were green. I 
    asked for permission from the bridge to go on with my round, which was granted." 
    </i> </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
      to normal procedure this should have been around 00.45-00.50 hours, i.e. 
      at the time when Kadak was in the ECR and saw water penetrating the bow 
      ramp. The communication between Silver Linde/bridge via walkie-talkie should 
      have been overheard by the watch engineer Treu, who has not stated anything 
      in this respect in any of his 12 known statements and interviews. What he 
      stated, however, in all but two of these twelve statements/interviews is 
      that he heard Silver Linde report to the bridge that there was<b> water 
      on car deck</b>. Safety officer Ervin Roden also overheard the walkie-talkie 
      communication between Silver Linde and the bridge. Ervin Roden had been 
      sleeping in his cabin with the walkie-talkie on when he suddenly heard Silver 
      Linde shouting to the bridge that there was<b> quite a lot of water on the 
      car deck</b> and that they had to abandon the vessel. (See the memos made 
      by Tuomo Karppinen attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.1.248.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

      21.3.4.352.</a>) In the spring of 1997 Ervin Roden admitted to the Estonian 
      journalist Heikki Tann that the above is correct.</font></p>

    time ago. I don't remember if the red one was in the lower or upper row. I 
    have since been on 2 ships and it is hard to remember. The indicator lights

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Actually 
      there had to be one red lamp, because at sea the harbour securing of the 
      visor is open, thus the indicator light is red. This would have been the 
      proper reply by Silver Linde, but he had been instructed differently by 
      the security adviser of Estline, Captain Enn Neidre, who obviously was not 
      aware of this respectively not acquainted with the installation. After this 
      'Group of Experts' had explained in writing to the JAIC the different functions 
      and meanings of the indicator lights, the consultant of the Estonian part 
      of the JAIC, Professor Jaan Metsaveer, tried to correct the already existing 
      impression that the Estonians did not know how their relevant safety installations 
      functioned, by stating at a joint meeting of the JAIC and this 'Group of 
      Experts' that the explanation for "all lights were green" was the fact that 
      the careful boatswain always closed the harbour securing at sea<b> to avoid 
      any lights being red</b>. After presentation of the video print below, from 
      one of the underwater videos showing the harbour securing open, the professor 
      remained silent for the rest of the meeting.</font></p>

    seven Statements of Silver Linde</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>a.) Noise heard 
    on car deck:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">ca. 00.45, 00.45, 
    00.35, 00.35/00.40, 00.40, ca. 00.45 and 00.50-00.55;<br>
    at first he spoke about an <b>unusual metal/metal noise</b>; then about<b> 
    a crash behind the ramp</b>, then at the hearing by JAIC on 17.10.94 and on 
    17.11.94 he explained the noise to have been<b> just slightly louder than 
    the normal ones created by wave impact </b>respectively that he <b>could hear 
    the noise only because he was just 1.5 m away</b> from the ramp and he would 
    not <b>have heard it if he would have been 10-20 m away</b>; at the Landvetter 
    hearing on 31.03.95 it became <b>a beating (not a scraping) noise </b>and, 
    finally, in his last testimony on 25.01.96 -<b> the noise was remarkable and 
    not typical for ship/wave contact and he had never heard it before or thereafter</b>, 
    which is actually in agreement with what 3rd engineer Margus Treu had said 
    from the beginning, although had always mentioned at least 2 extraordinary 
    bangs not caused by wave impact.<br>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> there had most 
    likely been something at <b>about 00.45 hours</b> and that he subsequently 
    changed the time according to the requirements of his principals which becomes 
    very obvious in his last statements when he puts the time at<b> 00.50/00.55 
    hours</b> because at that time JAIC had already decided to keep the time between 
    the first notification to the bridge and the very late Mayday as short as 
    possible;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the whole story 
    about his observations on the car deck at this time is fabricated anyway, 
    because at this time several crew members had been working hectically on the 
    car deck for some time already, including the boatswain Vello Ruben, and were 
    trying to hold the visor and the bow ramp.</font></li>

    he reported to the watch officer, which he certainly did at some time before 
    the heel (testimony Margus Treu, Paula Liikaama/ Ervin Roden), but he never 
    mentioned the<b> water on the car deck</b> which Margus Treu and Ervin Roden 
    heard him reporting;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> in his first statement 
    on 29.09.94 and in his 4th statement on 17.11.94 he did not mention that he 
    checked the control lights, in the following one - on 03.12.94 - he said <b>that 
    the controls for the bow ramp could only be operated by a special key which 
    was in the possession of the boatswain</b>, (the controls are in the same 
    box as the control lights which should have been locked), thus it has to be 
    assumed that he could not check the control lights. In all the other statements 
    he said that he did so.</font></li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the 
    above analysis the following conclusions have to be drawn:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) There had certainly 
    been bangs/crashes on the car deck at about 00.45 hours, but definitely not 
    just one. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) Silver Linde 
    must have noted a lot of water on the car deck at about this time or earlier 
    and certainly reported this to the bridge. It is possible that he looked into 
    the control panel and thereby also looked at the control lights which were 
    certainly not all green because definitely the bow ramp was not properly locked 
    and the harbour securing was open. The control panel must have been open because 
    the boatswain was working on the hydraulic cylinders of the visor and bow 
    ramp. In this connection his remark made on 3 December 1994 has to be understood, 
    that the <b>controls for the bow ramp could only be operated by a special 
    key which was in the possession of the boatswain.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) If Silver Linde 
    really went back to the bridge it must have been at 01.00 hours or just before 
    because the big heel occurred at 01.02 hours according to the clock of Mikael 
    Öun, and less than 5 minutes later Per-Erik Ehrnsten already saw him coming 
    out of the port inner alleyway on deck 7 walking into the forward central 
    stairway (details later on). It is possible that Linde went down to the Information 
    desk just after 01.00 hours - helped the elderly couple on deck 7, which took 
    about a minute according to his own statement, continued to deck 5 and was 
    at the Information desk when the big heel occurred, whereafter he pushed up 
    to the crew accommodation on deck 7. According to Per-Erik Ehrnsten Linde 
    was talking into his walkie-talkie all the time even when he fell and the 
    other two crew members who were with him - presumably Aulis Lee and Aldo Metspalu 
    - helped him back on to his feet and later out on to the deck. It is doubtful 
    and also unimportant whether he ever went down to deck 4 since it is highly 
    doubtful that he ever got an order from the bridge to go down to the car deck, 
    because since 00.45 hours or earlier it was known to those on watch that there 
    was water on the car deck and it is most probable that 2nd mate Peter Kannuussaar 
    and the nautical advisor Juri Aavik were already on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) This could be 
    the confirmation for a remark made by Linde which he made only once, viz. 
    that <b>he was sent down to the Information desk to advise them to alarm the 
    passengers.</b> It is also amazing that he admitted to having looked at his 
    watch<b> at 01.24 hours when he was already in the liferaft and the vessel 
    was on the side </b>bearing in mind that <b>the first "Mayday" was only picked-up 
    at 01.22 hours </b>and the<b> 3rd mate Andres Tammes was telling SILJA EUROPA 
    at 01.25 that the list was 20°/30° to the right side.</b> Even if Silver Linde's 
    watch had been wrong by 2-3 minutes the discrepancy is remarkable, i.e. just 
    when the mates had finally decided to transmit the "Mayday" at least A.B. 
    sailor Linde was already in the liferaft. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) This means also 
    that some of the AB's had left the vessel already at a stage when more or 
    less all the passengers and other crew members were still on board, because 
    at 01.24 hours the heel was probably between 50°-60°. Also Einar Kukk - who 
    was rather early outside on deck 7 - has testified that Silver Linde was already 
    in the liferaft when he went forward. </font></p>
