  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.3<br>
    The Development from July to December</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>July: </b>In the meantime 
    the "WASA KING" specification dated 25.09.92 which had been received at the 
    exhibition from the Turku Repair Yard - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.96</a> - had been translated and evaluated. See <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    3.4</a> - when Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 1 July and reported the following:<br>
    - He would finish the Report in two weeks, then everything would be in the 
    printing house and the printing would start.<br>
    - The result would be the 1st draft which would then be sent to all members 
    and experts for comments to be delivered by mid August. The enclosures would 
    be in a separate supplement of about 500 pages.<br>
    - After printing of the final version the Report would be published circa 
    mid to end September.<br>
    - A new Swedish Commission would be formed to investigate everything the Swedish 
    Government did or did not in connection with the ESTONIA; <br>
    - Karppinen was then asked whether he knew about the repair specification 
    dated 25.09.92 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.96.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.96</a> - which he confirmed and further advised that he had spoken with 
    Tuomo Mäkki about it, who had made an offer for the bow ramp hinges but not 
    for the visor locking devices.<br>
    Note: This is true. Behind the respective item is a handwritten note: "Price 
    to be quoted after visual inspection." Apparently Mäkki never inspected the 
    locking devices visually because in the meantime it had been decided to sell 
    the vessel and only those items were repaired by the sellers which had to 
    be rectified according to the sales contract. <br>
    Karppinen further explained that he had also spoken to the last Finnish inspector, 
    Charles Richardson from Wasa Line, who had told him that at the time the specification 
    was made up by the crew they did not know that the vessel would be sold.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - Next the possibility that 
    the Atlantic lock had been changed after newbuilding was discussed and Karppinen 
    said that there was a small chance because the basic primer of the visor lug 
    was found to be yellow but on the starboard lug grey. <br>
    Note: Actually the basic primer of all lugs had been yellow at newbuilding 
    - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 2.4.6</a> and<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.6.63.</a> <br>
    - Finally Karppinen advised that it had been decided that this 'Group of Experts' 
    would receive no parts whatsoever from the JAIC Report before the publication.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>August:</b> On 13 August 
    Tuomo Karppinen advised on the following:<br>
    - The draft version of their Report had now been distributed to the members 
    and experts except for three chapters which are still missing. <br>
    - He expects amendments, because after all delegations have read through the 
    draft he is certain that not everybody will agree. - Amendments are sent to 
    him and he incorporates them into the existing text. <br>
    - They still hope to publish around the 3rd anniversary. <br>
    On 15 August the Swedish JAIC had a working meeting in Stockholm. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>September:</b> From 3 
    to 5 September the Swedish JAIC went again through the text of the Report 
    and apparently concluded the matter. During this meeting it came to a clash 
    of different opinions which led to the resignation of the psychological expert 
    Bengt Schager three days later on 8 September. In a subsequent interview by 
    Jutta Rabe, Bengt Schager did explain the situation as follows:<br>
    <i>"BS: It was a meeting where we should look at the text. I was prepared 
    for that meeting because as I figured out, it was the last chance to alter 
    some of the details in a favourable way as I regard it is the truth. I was 
    very well prepared and got the message that this meeting would only deal with 
    the language problems and such things and that the report should be printed 
    even though not all the chapters were ready, I didn't think that this was 
    a proper way of working with it and then I told them that I would resign and, 
    also I might mention, before that, when Olof Forssberg was the Swedish chairman, 
    he was in favour for the opportunity for me of having a special opinion also 
    printed into the report and then, later on, I understood that Mr. Laur would 
    never allow a special opinion from me printed in the report. This, together 
    with the rush in timing was the basis for my decision, and the long frustration 
    also. <br>
    Q: But you emphasize just at this moment that their truth and your truth, 
    so there is a difference between your truth and their truth? <br>
    A: There is a discrepancy and, of course, I believe that I am right, but I 
    don't know and that's why I would like to be revealed my thinking when the 
    report is there, so that everyone who is reading the report and listening 
    to me, or, perhaps is reading what I am writing at that time and can see for 
    themselves and judge, because when you are one against 20 you have some difficulties 
    with, you have consequences with your relations, with the rest of them, and 
    arguing for something, when you have 20 against you, of which 10 are silent 
    but hostile and 10 are arguing against you, you have a friend at your side 
    frequently saying: "Bengt, stop, for heaven's sake, stop," then you may come 
    to a point, where you are really questioning yourself. Then, after a while, 
    you have to continue because you are believing in a certain thing and the 
    rest of them could not really give me good arguments. So, then you have to 
    continue, in a way. Even though, of course, it makes you sometimes a little 
    bit uncertain whether you really have right or not." </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 18 September Tuomo Karppinen 
    started during a telephone conversation: <br>
    - He received the comments/corrections from members and experts on Monday, 
    8 September, and has given the corrections to the printing house this Monday, 
    15 September.<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - He will receive 
    three printed copies in about two weeks which will then be read through again 
    by the English language expert and himself at least twice.<br>
    - Then the final version goes to the printing house and then it takes 4-5 
    weeks, i.e. publication mid to end November. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 22 September during a 
    further telephone conversation Tuomo Karppinen said that they will have another 
    full commission meeting in Tallinn due to unexpected difficulties with the 
    text and only thereafter the final corrections can be made and printing started, 
    i.e. publication early December. <br>
    On the same day "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published an ariticle which contained 
    the first interview with Bengt Schager after his resignation and which reads 
    - office translated - as follows:<br>
    <i>"'Estonia' Report is Protecting the Crew. <br>
    The 'Estonia' Report is incomplete. The Estonian chairman tries to avoid criticizing 
    the crew and this has disturbed the work of the commission, alleges an expert, 
    who resigned from the investigation. <br>
    Turbulent Investigation. <br>
    The investigation of the International Commission was accompanied by numerous 
    delays, censorship, accusations, criticism by the Judicial Ombudsman and change 
    of chairmen. <br>
    July 1996: The Estonian Chairman Andi Meister resigned after having severely 
    criticized the Swedish part of the Commission. <br>
    May 1997: Olof Forssberg, chairman of the Swedish part of the Commission, 
    was forced to resign after having lied to a radio reporter. <br>
    "I don't trust the Commission any longer", said Bengt Schager, psychological 
    expert of the 'Estonia' Commission, who resigned from the investigation under 
    protest. Now the 'Estonia' Report, which will be submitted to the printing 
    house shortly, risks loosing much of its credibility. <br>
    Bengt Schager is of the opinion that the commission did not properly investigate 
    the safety culture onboard of 'Estonia'. The question was much too sensitive. 
    "There has been a preparedness to talk matters and circumstances unfavourable 
    for the crew to their advantage." </i><br>
    <i><b>Bad Quality. </b></i><br>
    The 'Estonia' Commission is a three-nation commission with experts and members 
    from Estonia, Finland and Sweden. B. Schager means that the work was very 
    much disturbed by the obligation to reach agreement. The Swedes and Finns 
    had frequently considered giving up. <br>
    <i>"It has been so important to keep the Commission together to avoid that 
    somebody acts on his own initiative"</i>, he said.<br>
    <i>"I do not believe that the quality of the report is good. You find more 
    lessons to learn from this casualty than is mentioned in the report, there 
    had actually been lots of defects onboard"</i>, said Bengt Schager after almost 
    3 years work.<br>
    <i><b>Ferry Sentenced to Death.</b></i><br>
    Bengt Schager stressed that there is no disagreement inside the Commission 
    about the main cause of the casualty: These were technical defects which sank 
    'Estonia' down into the depth. The large ferry was sentenced to death. This 
    conclusion has never been in dispute. <br>
    The question about the acting of the Estonian crew in the very situation has, 
    however, been in dispute the more, Bengt Schager is of the opinion that there 
    are lots of question marks. <br>
    <i>"There are lots of things which belong into the report but which you cannot 
    find there",</i> he said. B. Schager is critical about the way the report 
    deals with the acting of the crew:<i> "Safety culture was with certainty not 
    at the standard which could be expected". </i><br>
    But he means that also other parts are defect. <i>"Certain analysis work was 
    more or less just average work. We should have gone much more into detail 
    and investigated much deeper",</i> he said pointing at the fact that they 
    were practically investigating Europe's largest ferry casualty in modern times. 
    <br>
    <i><b>Stressed Commission. </b></i><br>
    B. Schager sees two reasons why the investigation, according to him, shall 
    remain faulty (imperfect): Certain questions have been sensitive whilst the 
    commission has simultaneously been permanently under stress.<br>
    The investigation requirements could not withstand the requirements of the 
    media for a quick completion and, therefore, an incomplete report shall be 
    submitted.<br>
    B. Schager means that the Estonia Commission should have permitted herself 
    to investigate the matter properly." <br>

    40.3.481</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The interview is self-explanatory. 
    It confirms the bad atmosphere inside the JAIC which existed practically from 
    the very beginning, at first due to the dominant behaviour of Börje Stenström, 
    followed by the discrepancies which led to the resignation of Andi Meister 
    and finally due to the attempt of Uno Laur to protect Estonian interests.<br>
    On the 3rd anniversary of the catastrophe "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" published a 
    small article under the heading "Investigation of the 'Estonia' Catastrophe" 
    which reads - office translated - as follows: <br>
    <i><b>"Criminal Violation of the Maritime Law and/or Causing Other Persons' 
    Death" </b></i>is the heading under which the Criminal Police is investigating 
    the 'Estonia' catastrophe going on parallel with the investigation of the 
    International Commission. In addition to survivors' statements the police 
    and the chief prosecutor have among other things interrogated representatives 
    of N&T, who had the technical responsibility for the vessel and of the classification 
    society B.V. who approved vessel's construction and condition. "Some further 
    interro-gations are pending", said chief prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand, who 
    is leading the inquiry. The purpose of the inquiry is to find out it somebody 
    will have to be prosecuted for the 'Estonia' catastrophe." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>October:</b> On 17 October 
    Tuomo Karppinen reported as follows: <br>
    - The report was changed at the recent meeting and, as a matter of fact, they 
    are still discussing details.<br>
    - Next week the English language expert will come again for two days and check 
    the report whereafter it will go to the printing house.<br>
    - He estimates that it will take several weeks before the final version is 
    printed and they would be happy if the publication could take place before 
    the end of the year because this is what the politicians are demanding from 
    them. <br>
    - He said further that they were aware that "REGINA BALTICA" is either "VIKING 
    SAGA" or "VIKING SONG", but they did not look into the "NORD ESTONIA" matter 
    and they also had not realised that Ulf Hobro had been employed with Sjöfartsverket 
    as safety inspector before he joined N&T.<br>
    On 20 October Tuomo Karppinen reported more details:<br>
    - They have had a meeting in Helsinki with Ann-Louise Eksborg and Uno Laur 
    attending when the report and some minor changes were finally discussed. Casualty 
    scenario and cause considerations remained unchanged. The report is now finalised.<br>
    - Commencing tomorrow he will go through the changes together with their English 
    language expert Bing Crossfield from London, which might take two or three 
    days.<br>
    - Thereafter the changes will be worked into the existing manuscript by the 
    printers and a further manuscript will be printed, which he hopes to receive 
    around 26/27 October.<br>
    - He will then go through the complete manuscript once again and hopes to 
    be able to submit the final version by the beginning of November, i.e. week 
    45, to the printers who will then commence printing 5000 copies, which will 
    hopefully be completed in week 49.<br>
    - This means that the report will be published either in week 49 or 50. The 
    exact date will be fixed as soon as printing has started. <br>
    - Since the summer, i.e. after the exhibition of this 'Group of Experts', 
    they have included a new chapter into their report which concerns the "upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck = car deck" and have 
    tried to find an explanation for the attitudes of Sjöfartsverket and Finska 
    Sjöfartstyrelse.<br>
    Thereafter it was decided to have an up-date exhibition in Stockholm during 
    the time of publication of the JAIC Report and the preparations commenced 
    straight away. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>November:</b> In the early 
    days the Swedish TV 2 program "STRIPTEASE" showed the second part of their 
    "Estonia" investigation. It was apparent that the "STRIPTEASE" journalists 
    had a copy of the Final JAIC Report or one of the drafts of it, which they 
    had submitted to Prof. Vassalous of the West Clyde University, Glasgow, one 
    of the leading naval architects in the UK. Vassalous was asked to give an 
    opinion on the technical part and the conclusions, which he did.<br>
    The JAIC had concluded: <br>
    "The casualty sequence may have started around 00.55 hours when an A.B. seaman 
    heard a metallic bang behind bow ramp. Locks and hinges broke completely through 
    one or two heavy waves just after 01.00 hours. Consequence: The locks were 
    too weak. 'Estonia' had met similar wave conditions only once or twice earlier 
    between Tallinn and Stockholm. The accident occurred under conditions that 
    were probably the worst she had ever encountered. The casualty has no pre-history, 
    everything happened in one sequence and very quickly."<br>
    " Vassalous commented: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"To reach ultimate loads 
      at sea so that the components could fail in one or two loads is highly unlikely 
      . Most components that fail at sea do so because of fatigue, there must 
      have been a pre-history. Therefore the cause for the failures has to be 
      found in the condition of the ship, and especially of the visor."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>" The professor did not 
    accept that the visor was really completely o.k. on the casualty night nor 
    did he accept that the conditions were unique. He stated that cyclic loading 
    is the nature of any structure, failure caused by fatigue loading is "a fact 
    of marine life". </i><br>
    Failure to use common sense by the JAIC was his conclusion. <br>
    More uncertainty came up when the General Director of the E.N.M.B. and Estonian 
    observer in the JAIC, Kalle Pedak, and the head of the Maritime Division (Department) 
    of the E.N.M.B., Aarne Valgma, went public by giving an interview to the Baltic 
    News Service about the circumstances surrounding the diving investigation 
    of the ESTONIA in December 1994 when only Aarne Valgma had represented the 
    Estonian side. <br>
    The following is quoted from BNS message: <br>
    "The divers' mission, which lasted for 64 hours, was filmed and the video 
    picture was continuously forwarded to the support vessel. The Swedish Maritime 
    Administration, which had commissioned the mission, supervised it from aboard 
    the same ship, and also the Swedish criminal police observed the course of 
    the mission there.<br>
    Valgma said that during the 64-hour mission there were moments when there 
    was no video picture on his monitor. <br>
    "All I can presume is that the diving work was not filmed during those breaks." 
    Valgma told BNS on Thursday. Maritime Department general director Kalle Pedak 
    said it was not very likely there were breaks in the video recording during 
    the divers' mission. <br>
    <i>"Valgma had admitted that at intervals he saw no video picture in his monitor 
    room and had no access to the ship's main monitor"</i>, Pedak told BNS.<i> 
    "I believe there was a video picture on the main monitor all the time, because 
    the divers were constantly watched".</i><br>
    Pedak and Valgma didn't want to comment on why the video picture was interrupted 
    on the Estonian observer's monitor."" <br>
    The complete wording of the message is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.3.482.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    40.3.482</a>.<br>
    On 17 November the following message was received from the JAIC:<br>
    "Re: Press conference concerning the presentation of the Final Report of MV 
    'Estonia' <br>
    The Joint Estonian, Finnish and Swedish Commission to investigate the 'Estonia' 
    catastrophe presents its Final Report on 3rd December. The Commission meets 
    in Tallinn to present the Report jointly at 12.00 hours. Simultaneously the 
    Report is submitted to the Swedish and Finnish Governments. A press conference 
    shall be held in Estonia as follows:<br>
    Date : Wednesday, 3rd December 1997<br>
    Time : 13.00 hours <br>
    Place : Sakala Centre, 12 Rävala Avenne, Tallinn <br>
    The Report, which is in English, can be simultaneously picked up, i.e. at 
    the BoA/Stockholm at 11.00 hours and at the BoA/Helsinki at 12.00 hours." 
    T<br>
    his was the end of the communication between the JAIC and this 'Group of Experts' 
    because the JAIC ceased to exist after the publication of their Final Report.

    The Second Exhibition in Stockholm 1 to 14 December 1997</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>The Motivation</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The decision to have another 
    Exhibition in Stockholm before, during and after the publication of the Final 
    Report of the International Commission was based on </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">(a) the growing certainty 
    that the International Commission would conclude in their final report that 
    the casualty was mainly caused by the too weak locking devices of the visor 
    due to faulty design, etc.;<br>
    (b) the fact that such an Exhibition was the only possibility of proving quickly 
    and convincingly to the national and international media as well as to the 
    Swedish public that the above-mentioned conclusions were wrong;<br>
    (c) the frequently stated wish of many visitors to the 1st Exhibition to come 
    back and give them the chance of comparing the findings of the JAIC with the 
    findings of the German 'Group of Experts' after the Final Report had been 
    published. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>Preparations</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Based on the experience with 
    the 1st Exhibition it was decided to organise everything in close cooperation 
    with the two relative organisations SEA and DIS and moreover to invite them 
    to perform the exhibition jointly with this 'Group of Experts' and participate 
    actively in the day-to-day preparations. This was welcomed by both organisations. 
    Whilst SEA offered the assistance of their vice chairman Odd Lundkvist, who 
    had been a conference/exhibition manager before his retirement, DIS offered 
    the services of their technical expert Alve Wendt as exhibition guide in order 
    to help this 'Group of Experts' with the many visitors to be expected. In 
    addition, SEA would show their own little exhibition simultaneously. The SEA 
    exhibition would draw attention to the crucial mistakes made by the Swedish 
    government in the handling of the ESTONIA affair. DIS wanted to put up some 
    screens whereupon they would outline what they thought were the real causes 
    for the disaster and who had done what wrong.<br>
    When it was definite that the Final Report would be published on 3 December, 
    1997 in Tallinn and copies could be picked up simultaneously in the JAIC offices 
    in Helsinki and Stockholm the following arrangements were made: <br>
    - advertisements should appear on 29/30 November, on 1 and 2 December, and 
    again on 8 December<br>
    o in DAGENS NYHETER, SVENSKA DAGBLADET, AFTONBLADET, METRO - all in Stockholm

    This time no one was invited to the opening nor was there a press conference 
    on the occasion of the opening, nevertheless visitors started streaming in 
    right from the beginning and it can be said that the average number per day 
    was in the range of 200, however, there were days with twice this figure. 
    <br>
    The visitors spent a lot of time with reading, had less questions and thus 
    the stress for the Exhibition guides was much less than previously. <br>
    Also the atmosphere this time was different right from the beginning, it was 
    much more relaxed and free of tension, which was certainly to a considerable 
    extent due to the presence of the representatives of the relative organisations,

    Berglund and Odd Lundkvist managed to obtain substantial parts of manuscript 
    of the Final Report and members of this 'Group of Experts' started immediately 
    to analyse the contents. <br>
    The chairman of the Association of Swedish Marine Underwriters, Sten Gathenborg, 
    paid a visit to the Exhibition and everything was explained to him. He asked 
    thereafter whether it would be possible to have a private show for the Swedish 
    Marine Underwriters without the public and this was agreed for 9 December, 
    from 08.30 to 11.00 hours. <br>
    In the afternoon the Hamburg office phoned and informed that two complete 
    sets of the Final Report of the Commission including supplements had just 
    arrived by courier from Kari Lethola, the chairman of the Finnish JAIC, which 
    meant that almost 24 hours before the official publication the JAIC Report 
    was available to this 'Group of Experts'. The main parts were sent by fax 
    and the analysis commenced at once in order to have some comments already 
    on the following day. <br>
    During the evening and parts of the night the Report was analysed as well 
    as possible and already then it became quite obvious that </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC's scenario was 
    based on the possibility that the vessel could have encountered 1 or 2 heavy 
    waves which could have been able to break to locks of the visor, etc. and 
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">the JAIC had completely 
    ignored the passengers' statements as to time of heel, water on 1st deck and 
    on car deck and</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the JAIC had completely 
    ignored the disastrous maintenance condition of visor and bow ramp; but had, 
    to the contrary, found that the vessel had left Tallinn in a completely seaworthy 
    condition, well maintained, manned and loaded. </font> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The conclusions were - 
      as already in the Part-Report from April 1995 - that "the visor attachments 
      were not designed according to realistic design assumptions ..." and "the 
      attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic calculations 
      required", etc. <br>
      So not very much had changed during the past 3 years, almost nothing of 
      what this 'Group of Experts' had submitted to the JAIC had been taken into 
      account, it was thus still the Yard and only the Yard on which blame was 
      put. <br>
      The defence was prepared straight away by so-called "First Remarks on the 
      Report of the International Commission" of which 400 copies were distributed 
      to visitors until the closing of the Exhibition. One copy is attached as 
      <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.4.483a.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures

      As of 11.00 hours the Report plus Supplements could be picked up by anybody 
      at the office of the Swedish JAIC. <br>
      An article appeared in "DAGENS NYHETER" wherein the previous psychology 
      expert Bengt Schager, who had resigned from the JAIC in September, stated 
      that ESTONIA had left Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition referring to the 
      evidence of the Sjöfartsverket inspector Åke Sjöblom, who had left the vessel 
      only shortly before her departure. This led to additional questions from 
      many visitors. <br>
      Next, Gerhard Klahn phoned from Ystad in Southern Sweden and stated to have 
      seen a TV interview with the above-mentioned Åke Sjöblom shortly after the 
      casualty during which he had said that they had found the bow ramp in a 
      totally unsatisfactory condition and had strongly recommended to their Estonian 
      colleagues not to permit the ferry to sail in this condition, which, however, 
      was ignored. He was then asked by the journalist what he would have done 
      if he had checked the ESTONIA in a Swedish port? He replied that under absolutely 
      no circumstance would the ferry have left port. </font></p>

      This was the day of the press conference of this 'Group of Experts' right 
      in the middle of the Exhibition. It began at 11.00 hours with approximately 
      40 journalists and four camera teams attending, many of whom had been in 
      Tallinn the day before. (Reportedly some 200 persons attended the press 
      conference of the JAIC.) Dr. Holtappels submitted the first analysis of 
      the JAIC's Report, drew attention to the obvious mistakes and wrong conclusions, 
      answered numerous questions from partly very insistent journalists who were 
      much better prepared than they had been in June. Simultaneously the survivor 
      from the 1st deck, Carl Övberg, was introduced to the media and told his 
      story and answered questions.<br>
      Thereafter it was explained by means of the models that the scenario of 
      the JAIC was not possible to have happened and, as a comparison, this 'Group 
      of Experts' scenario was presented, as supported by the statements of the 
      survivors and other facts. <br>

      The reactions to the press conference were: <br>
      - in DAGENS NYHETER : Nothing. <br>
      - in SVENSKA DAGBLADET : On page 6 a quarter-page article: "The German Yard 
      Criticizes The Report." <br>
      - in TT PRESSEN (nationwide): "The Yard does not accept any blame." <br>
      - in GÖTEBORG POSTEN: "German Criticism Against The Estonia Report."<br>
      "The Yard Is Supported By Sweden." Christer Lindvall, managing director 
      of the Swedish Masters' and Ship Officers' Association, agrees to a certain 
      extent that 'ESTONIA' sank due to poor maintenance and not faulty design 
      or construction by Meyer Werft. <br>
      In the morning Lennart Berglund and Anders Lindström, managing director 
      of Sjöfartsverket, were interviewed on Breakfast TV and Lennart Berglund 
      stated to have reliable information that Åke Sjöblom had discovered the 
      damaged bow ramp and tried to stop the ferry. Lindström reacted with obvious 
      shock and said he knew nothing about this, but would certainly investigate 
      it. <br>
      This triggered off some press activities which were, however, overshadowed 
      by the new developments in the Palme murder case, which were told to the 
      media in a separate press conference at 10.00 hours. Probably for this reason 
      the press conferences of DIS and SEA at the same time were just attended 
      by one or two journalists.</font></p>

      1997 </b><br>
      The Exhibition was reopened at 11.00 hours and the visitors streamed in 
      more than before and the questions were sharper and more precise because 
      all of them had read the comments in the papers, followed the TV and radio 
      comments and sometimes had even studied the JAIC's Report respectively were 
      in the process of doing so and wanted to fill gaps by looking at the Exhibition 
      and asking questions. This was exactly what this 'Group of Experts' had 
      expected. <br>
      A number of retired masters, pilots, engineers, divers and even safety inspectors 
      from Sjöfartsverket came and stayed on an average of two hours. Many came 
      again on one of the next days. In addition, people calling from all over 
      the country and also from Finland, offered their knowledge, photos, videos. 
      <br>
      The repair manager of Turku Repair Yard, Arvi Puroya, also visited the exhibition 
      and upon being questioned he stated that <br>
      - N&T had not booked any drydocking space for January 1995 for ESTONIA,<br>
      - nor had he received any repair specifications. <br>
      He also confirmed that the only JAIC member or expert who had ever visited 
      the yard was Tuomo Karppinen. <br>
      One of the visiting retired pilots stated that the traffic controller of 
      Sandhamn had told him that he had frequently seen ESTONIA passing on her 
      way out with the visor slightly open. This was mainly during the last weeks 
      before the casualty. <br>
      Another visitor said that the weather statements in the JAIC's Report were 
      wrong and "selected". The naval architect Per Fagerlund stated that he had 
      immediately called his friends at SSPA when he heard the nonsense of Karppinen 
      that the speed had had no relevance for the catastrophe and they had strictly 
      rejected to have found anything during their tank tests which would support 
      that and also had made it quite clear that they did not want to be quoted 
      in this connection. <br>
      A visitor, who refused to tell his name, stated that he had been working 
      for Stolt and had been on the Stolt diving support vessel "STOLT COMEX", 
      which had been on the ESTONIA position already a few days after the casualty 
      and which Stolt immediately offered to Sjöfartsverket for a diving survey. 
      He said that they had made some tests in the early stages and measured radio 
      activity near the vessel.<br>
      In the evening the Swedish JAIC explained their findings and conclusions 
      to the survivors and relatives. Reportedly Mikael Huss said that the Yard 
      had not only miscalculated the loads, but had also used the wrong low quality 
      steel. Ann-Louise Eksborg said that the manual locks were only to be used 
      if the others were out of order. The expert of DIS, Alve Wendt, put the 
      question to Mikael Huss, whether they had considered what would happen to 
      the ramp hinges if the vessel would proceed with fully open ramp and 15 
      kn speed against head seas? With certainty the hinges would break. M. Huss 
      replied that this had been neither considered nor calculated, although it 
      was part of their scenario. Note: See Subchapter 34.10 - The hinges would 
      break and the ramp fall off. </font></p>

      He admitted the general responsibility of N&T for the conditions of the 
      vessel upon departure from Tallinn with exception of the too weak locks. 
      They had no knowledge about this hidden defect and said that had they known, 
      they would have rectified it. <br>

      last Finnish crew from September 1992.</font></p>

      Royal Technical<br>
      University (KTH) Stockholm on 01.12.97 <br>
      This seminar, planned already to take place in June, had to be postponed 
      due to the delayed publication of the JAIC Report because it was practically 
      a presentation of work and results of the JAIC. Since Swedish was the main 
      language the Finnish lawyer of Messrs. Meyer Werft did attend and his report 
      reads as follows:<br>
      "The purpose of the seminar was apparently an attempt to explain for shipbuilders 
      and engineers the conclusions drawn by the JAIC in its recently published 
      report.<br>
      Among the audience one can find a number of representatives for the shipbuilding 
      and shipping industry in general, but also some insurers and lawyers.<br>
      First speaker was Ms. Ann-Louise Eksborg, recently appointed chairman of 
      the Swedish national commission. <br>
      She discussed the aims and purposes of commission work mainly from an internal 
      Swedish point of view, emphasizing the importance of the JAIC integrity 
      especially towards those authorities, who supervise the activities subject 
      to an investigation, i.e. The Board of Navigation, the Board of Aviation 
      etc. <br>
      She took it for granted, that parties subject to an investigation would 
      not participate in the work.<br>
      On my question whether she thinks these high principles were followed b 
      the JAIC she immediately grasped the purpose of the question and admitted, 
      that the Estonian members were not impartial if measured by this standard, 
      but she explained their presence in the JAIC with the allegation that apparently 
      all Estonian navigators are or have been employed by the ESCO. There should, 
      however, not remain any doubt among the audience after this answer, about 
      the fact that the JAIC was clearly prejudiced. <br>
      Tuomo Karppinen then ventured to explain the sequence of events as per the 
      JAIC's apprehension, first stating that times given have the exactness of 
      ± 2 minutes. <br>
      Karppinen then stated that some of the points of time given are more reliable 
      than others, as these can be explained by means of outside sources; such 
      are: the time of departure, the time for passing the waypoint, the time 
      for the first MayDay message and the consequent radio traffic, as well as 
      the time or the Estonia disappearing from the radar screen of the Mariella. 
      <br>
      Karppinen, however, started the summing up of the events with the "bang" 
      heard by the AB, and after that, in my opinion, all points of time are in 
      fact based on the indications given by crew members, not by the passengers. 
      Accordingly the JAIC is, albeit the point of time cannot be verified, of 
      the opinion that the events started at 00.55, that the visor locking devices 
      were broken between 1.05 and 1.10, and that the visor fell off at 1.15 with 
      immediate list as a consequence.<br>
      From the evidence recorded it is apparent, that the JAIC is not, as said, 
      attaching any greater significance to statements by passengers. <br>
      Karppinen also described the maneuvering of the vessel at this period of 
      time, i.e. the total lack of maneuvers with the exception of the fact that 
      the speed was turned down when the vessel already had a severe list. <br>
      A member of the audience very in detail expressed his opinions how a vessel 
      in a situation like this should be maneuvered, by reducing speed, turning 
      the stem/stern against the sea etc., to which Karppinen responded that obviously, 
      if the vessel had been turned such that the angle to the sea would have 
      been abt. 90 degrees, the water could not have entered through the ramp 
      at all and the vessel would have been saved. Karppinen had obvious difficulties 
      with explaining to the audience why the JAIC did not clearly say this in 
      its report. <br>
      After this discussion, there could not be any uncertainty in respect of 
      the fact that grave errors by the crew significantly contributed to, if 
      not even caused the accident." <br>
      In respect of Rahka's paper, as far as I could understand, the difference 
      in opinions between the yard/the JAIC viz. the strength calculations regarding 
      the visor locks is now being explained with reference to a turning moment 
      caused by the impact of the seas coming from abt 30 degrees to port from 
      the vessel's line of heading. <br>
      Rahka emphasized a number of times that irrespective of how the calculations 
      are made ,the locks were too weak anyhow. <br>
      Rahka denied, that the JAIC would have said that the speed was of no significance 
      at all; he (and Karppinen) stated, that a speed below 10 kn, would have 
      nullified the risk of visor failure, but the point is that speed impact 
      is linear while wave impact is proportional.<br>
      As to Huss's two papers, there was nothing extraordinary to be mentioned.<br>
      Fransson discussed the Solas requirements as to the placing of the collision 
      bulkhead extension, and concluded that the solution onboard Estonia was 
      in conflict with the applicable rules.<br>
      Much was discussed about the original approval by the FBN and subsequent 
      approvals by the BV on behalf of the Estonian BN. I did ask Fransson what 
      his opinion is about the alleged seaworthiness of the vessel at departure 
      from Tallinn, if the vessel de facto was in breach of the Solas requirements, 
      and he transferred the question to the JAIC representatives, of which Karppinen 
      ventured to answer. He said, that the seaworthiness statement in the report 
      is to be understood as a legal and formal one only! This answer no doubt 
      is the more peculiar, as the breach of the Solas requirements clearly is 
      a "formal and legal" failure, as the vessel no doubt had valid certificates.<br>
      In the end I asked Karppinen about the repair list from the Turku repairyard, 
      and the answer was that in fact this was not a quote, but a summary of the 
      items the deck officers had forwarded as a "wish", and Karppinen's rather 
      unfounded conclusion was that actually there were nothing at that time to 
      remark about the locks/hinges/packings! <br>
      He had no proper answer to the question that the list no doubt also comprised 
      items which the JAIC has chosen to mention as unrepaired, that is the packings. 
      How the JAIC has arrived at the conclusion that the remaining items were 
      not of importance or, as he is saying, did not exist, is unclear.<br>
      He did after the seminar take great pain in explaining to me that the list 
      is not an usual "to do" list, but something else, which I refused to understand. 
      <br>
      As such the seminar was interesting, but too comprehensive with too little 
      space for adequate questions; too much was packed in the program. Another 
      problem was the heterogeneous composition of the audience, a number of participants 
      with knowledge based on media information only took up the time with self-evident 
      questions.<br>
      I met afterwards Karppinen and Rahka on the airport, and we had a pleasant 
      discussion waiting for the much delayed plane.<br>
      I told them that my opinion is, that they have an uphill task in convincing 
      the interested parties in respect of the correctness of their conclusions, 
      as the JAIC in the eyes of any outsider is prejudiced, and as some conclusions, 
      such as the role of the crew, are obviously quite wrong. The two gentlemen 
      admitted the difficulties with the Estonians once more, but emphasized of 
      course the value of their own contributions. They welcomed me or my prospective 
      principals to study the background material now available at the VTT." <br>
      Nothing more remains to be done but to compare the investigation results
