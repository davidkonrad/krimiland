<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>THE DAY IN TALLINN</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On 27 September 
    1994 ESTONIA was lying at her berth in Tallinn with open visor and open bow 
    ramp, whilst the crew was carrying out some maintenance work and was preparing 
    her for the take-over of passengers, cars, trucks, and trailers in the late 
    afternoon.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> While a number of 
    deckhands were clearing up and cleaning the car deck, provisions and stores 
    were taken over and brought down to the provision area on the 1st deck by 
    means of the big lift at the aft end of the centre casing. At the same time 
    one AB was painting the port anchor from a cherry picker standing on the open 
    bow ramp. Even in summer the port anchor with pocket had to be painted quite 
    often as the anchor was frequently used during berthing manoeuvres at Tallinn 
    when Captain Arvo Andresson was in charge, who was still unable to manoeuvre 
    the big vessel the way his colleagues in Finland and Sweden had done during 
    the past 14 years without problems.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Other AB's were 
    painting in the forepart of the car deck near the control panel for visor 
    and bow ramp and the upper flaps of the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At noon two representatives 
    from the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, chief inspectors <b>Åke Sjöblom</b> and <b>Gunnar 
    Zahlée</b>, came on board together with a group of nine high ranking officials 
    in Estonian Ship Safety, who were to be trained in Port State Control matters. 
    ESTONIA was selected to be the test vessel for this day (see details in the 
    following Chapter 15). <b>Captain Andresson</b> was said to be ashore, thus 
    the chief mate <b>Juhan Herma</b> and the chief engineer <b>Lembit Leiger</b> 
    were in charge of the ferry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most of the passengers 
    who returned with the ferry to Stockholm the same evening were ashore on sightseeing 
    tours whilst others attended on board seminars and did not go ashore at all. 
    Among them was a group of Statoil Sweden employees and a group of 68 police 
    civil servants belonging to the ST section of the Stockholm police. The seniors 
    of this group had cabins on the outer and inner side of deck 6 while others 
    were staying in cabins of the 5th and 4th decks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two members of another 
    group, <b>Rolf Sörman </b>and <b>Nebosja Grkovic</b> - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.335.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.335.1</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.348.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.4.348</a> - had returned from shore early and were having their lunch 
    in the restaurant "Poseidon" in the aft part of deck 6. They observed six 
    or seven persons at the big table in the centre, one of whom was the master 
    of the second crew, <b>Captain Avo Piht</b>. Another one was an officer wearing 
    a blue uniform. Furthermore there were two ladies and two gentlemen in civil 
    clothes probably the two Stockholm pilots with their ladies. There was a friendly 
    atmosphere. A walky-talky was standing upright on the table and was obviously 
    turned on channel 16 because they heard a gale warning in English. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the new passengers 
    coming on board in the course of the afternoon was the weapons dealer <b>Alexander 
    Vorodin</b>, his father-in-law <b>Vasili Krjutjkov</b>, and his cousin <b>Vassili 
    Vorodin</b>, who received either cabin 6320 or 6230. This is of some importance 
    because later, during the diving survey in December 1994, the suitcase of<b> 
    Alexander Vorodin </b>was taken out of cabin 6230 by a diver. It was the second 
    cabin on the port side in front of deck 6 which however - according to the 
    survivor purser<b> Andres Vihmar </b>- had been assigned to <b>Captain Avo 
    Piht</b>. - See Andres Vihmar's statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.195</a> . On the other hand, <b>Vasili Krjutjkov </b>did testify in his 
    first statement - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.196</a> that their cabin had been 6230 and only in his subsequent statement 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.197.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.197</a> - said, it had been 6320 while his nephew <b>Vassili Vorodin</b> 
    stated that they had looked out of the window after the abrupt starboard heel. 
    This would not have been possible from cabin 6320 which was an inside cabin 
    without windows. Thus it has to be assumed that the Vorodins were in cabin 
    6230.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the Swedish 
    press photographer<b> Håkan Isefjord </b>came on board with his camera equipment, 
    of which he should later hide one camera with 2 films in lifeboat no. 9 which 
    was the last lifeboat on the starboard side of ESTONIA. When the lifeboat 
    was found several days after the casualty on the Estonian north coast the 
    camera, with two films, was found jammed inside the lifeboat and subsequently 
    delivered to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from where it was sent by diplomatic 
    mail to Stockholm. According to the files of the public prosecutor the films, 
    however, were not in the camera anymore.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another passenger 
    was the auditor <b>Peeter Riit </b>who reportedly came on board rather late 
    since he had missed the last plane to Stockholm and therefore took the ferry. 
    <b>Peeter Riit</b> was employed by the Stockholm auditors KPMG who had been 
    instructed by N&T to examine the books of Estline, Tallinn. Reportedly <b>Peeter 
    Riit </b>had completed this job on 27 September 1994 and was now on his way 
    back to Stockholm with a number of, for ESCO, rather damaging documents.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Among the passengers 
    were also a considerable number of businessmen, such as <b>Per-Erik Ehrnsten, 
    Carl Övberg</b> and <b>Tony Spuhl</b>, who had made many previous voyages 
    on board the ferry and thus knew the vessel and crew quite well, which also 
    goes for many truck drivers who came up to the Reception Desk after having 
    driven their trucks on to the car deck and were shown to cabins on the 4th 
    deck reserved for truck drivers only. Most of them sensed a certain state 
    of nervousness with the crew members they met which they had never done before 
    on the many earlier voyages.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason for this 
    certain nervousness of some of the crew members could have been the attempt 
    of the Swedish Safety Inspector<b> Åke Sjöblom </b>to stop the ferry from 
    departing which was certainly realised by some crew members and then quickly 
    spread around. </font></p>
