    2.4.3.32</a>) - 2 pages - Meyer Werft requested Bureau Veritas to proceed 
    with the operations required by their Rules for the purpose of obtaining the 
    classification under Special Survey, i.e. construction drawings were to be 
    checked against the rules and the building of the vessel was to be supervised, 
    same as one year before the DIANA II.</font></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the above-mentioned 
    form filled in by Meyer Werft the 'NO' box referring to the load-line is marked, 
    whilst in all other cases the 'YES' boxes are marked.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    interpretation of the B.V. head office this means that the Yard has requested 
    B.V. just to issue the Load Line Certificate and to specifically exclude any 
    Statutory Certificates. Actually Meyer Werft had filed a further application 
    dated 21 April 1980 with Bureau Veritas, viz. "Application for an International 
    Freeboard Certificate or for an International Load Line Exemption Certificate 
    within the Scope of the International Convention on Load Lines 1966" which 
    would mean that the Yard applied for the same services a second time (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.33.htm">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.33</a>). The Load Line Certificate was in fact issued by B.V.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1979/1980 the 
    "1977 Rules of B.V." were in force. According to §§ 11-44, indentations 2 
    and 3 of those rules the following applied to bow visors: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2 - Bow and 
      stern doors <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">21 
      - When the ship is equipped with a bow door, to allow access to garage, 
      the collision bulkhead must have a removable part. This design is acceptable 
      only above bulkhead deck and only if the removable part has a watertightness 
      and a strength equivalent to those of fixed rule bulkhead. <br>
      A movable access ramp may be used for this purpose.<br>
      22 - Scantlings of plating and stiffeners of a bow door are to be equivalent 
      to those of adjacent shell structure.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.34.htm" target="_blank">See 
    Enclosure 2.4.3.34</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    the bow ramp, located above bulkhead deck = car deck, served as the upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead no matter what the distance to the forward 
    perpendicular was, provided the bow ramp was watertight and had a strength 
    equivalent to those of fixed collision bulkheads. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These conditions 
    were fulfilled by the bow ramp of VIKING SALLY, thus the construction complied 
    with the B.V. Rules in force at the time the vessel was built. Only one year 
    later, in 1981, the SOLAS 1974 Rules were incorporated into the B.V. Rules 
    which had no more effect on VIKING SALLY because she had already been delivered 
    in June 1980. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»3 - Securing 
      of doors<br>

      - Doors and screen-doors have to be firmly secured by use of cleats conveniently 
      spaced or other similar devices. Particularly it has to be provided one 
      of these devices at each corner of opening. Structure reinforcements have 
      to be realised on door and adjacent shell plating to attached points of

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In their letter

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Actually the 
    senior B.V. surveyor G.Lohmann, entrusted with the newbuilding supervision 
    of DIANA II / VIKING SALLY and also with their predeces-sors, had accepted 
    the bow visor in its entirety already on 20.06.80 by his signature on the 
    Receipt/Transfer Certificate (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.22.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    2.4.3.37</a>) B.V. also draws the attention to the remarks made in red on 
    drawings 1103 and 49111-330, i.e.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> on drawing 1103

      in y-direction (transverse).«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As stated above, 
    this drawing was approved only on 20.06.80 - the day the vessel went out for 
    trials - thus shortly before her delivery - and returned to the Yard subsequently, 
    and it is indeed the question of what use such remarks are if they are made 
    on drawings which are returned to the Yard only after the vessel has already 
    left. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is slightly 
    different with the von Tell drawing 49111-330 - General Arrangement of Bow 
    Visor and Bow Ramp - which was approved already on 05.11.79 and subsequently 
    returned to von Tell with the following remarks in red: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»1. Arrangement

      4. High pressure flexible pipes must be approved by B.V.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V.'s explanation 
    for these remarks in their letter of 10.01.95: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»By the remark 
      concerning the National Authorities it was made clear that locking devices 
      were considered as an item subject to the examination and approval of the 
      Finnish Authorities issuing the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate of the 
      vessel.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In order to obtain 
    clarification how this was actually to be interpreted the official opinion 
    of B.V. was requested via their Stockholm lawyer - Bengt-Åke Johnson - who 
    has commented as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»With regard 
      to the wording in German on the drawing 590/1103 to which you refer in your 
      fax of 20 February 1995, I have learned that Bureau Veritas inserted the 
      wording just to clarify that the approval of Bureau Veritas did only concern 
      the parts of the construction that were covered by the rules of Bureau Veritas 
      then applicable in 1979 and that Bureau Veritas made the remark on the drawings 
      in order to remove doubts and to direct the attention of the shipyard and 
      the Finnish authorities to the fact that the locking devices were to be 
      considered and approved by the Finnish authorities. Accordingly, Bureau 
      Veritas approved the drawings to the extent the arrangements were generally 
      complying with the Bureau Veritas rules, but wanted to draw the attention 
      of the shipyard and the Finnish authorities to the fact, that Bureau Veritas 
      could not approve something, i.e. the locking devices, which were not specifically 
      covered by Bureau Veritas' rules of 1979.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    by the remark quoted above in their letter to the JAIC of 10.01.95, as well 
    as by the comments of Bengt-Åke Johnson, that B.V. wants to create the impression 
    that the final approval of the locking devices is the responsibility of the 
    National Maritime Administration, i.e. the F.B.N., because they issue the 
    Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a result of this 
    investigation it has to concluded that this is wrong because</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Rule 3 of 
      the 1977 B.V. Rules requires, among others, that "Doors ... have to be firmly 
      secured by use of cleats conventionally spaced or other similar devices." 
      It reveals from the B.V. letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank"> 
      Enclosure 2.4.3.37</a> - that cleats = cleating = locking devices consequently 
      the locking devices of the bow door = visor were part of the B.V. approval; 
      <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) B.V. 
      had anyway to carry out the approval even if it would have been the responsibility 
      of the F.B.N., because it was a "structural matter" which B.V. had to carry 
      out on behalf of F.B.N. due to the respective contract between the organisations. 
      - See also Subchapter 2.4.4.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    above is confirmed by the acting of B.V. surveyor Lohmann as well as by the 
    statement of the principal surveyor of the B.V. Stockholm office, Lars-Olof 
    Ålander, according to which he felt responsible for the locking devices and 
    sensors. - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/9.1.134.htm" target="_blank">See Enclosure 
    9.1.134.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Futhermore the B.V. 
    head office was asked to explain by what means, for example, could a plan 
    approver make sure that a "door", i.e. bow visor, would be "firmly secured 
    by use of cleats", i.e. locking devices, dimensioned as per drawing which 
    he is asked to approve? The answer was that B.V. relied on the design office 
    (von Tell AB) and the Yard, respectively their calculations, but made no own 
    calculations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that the 
    relevant drawings were approved on basis of the von Tell AB calculations carried 
    out according to the Lloyd's Register requirements, the result of which was 
    submitted to BV-Hamburg by telex of 18.03.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.23.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.23</a>). The Yard carried out own calculations with about the same result. 
    Consequently both the Yard and its subcontractor individually performed calculations, 
    whilst B.V. and F.B.N. did not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The B.V. head office 
    was further asked by what means did the B.V. surveyor on site make sure that 
    the Yard/von Tell installed locking devices according to the approved drawings. 
    The answer: »By random inspections.«</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon request of 
    the B.V. head office after the ESTONIA catastrophe the senior B.V. surveyor 
    G.Lohmann wrote down the remarks made in his notebook during the newbuilding 
    phase in relation to the bow visor (with English translation made by himself 
    indicating what he would like to have noted) - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.3.38</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Actually the only

      have had by then was 49111-330 - "General Arrangement of Bow Visor and Bow 
      Ramp" which shows details of the bow ramp hinges only. Actually it has to 
      be assumed that the remark in the notebook: "Connection of bow visor to 
      aft part" refers to connecting the visor to the vessel, i.e. fitting the 
      hinges together which was done at about that time.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both surveyors - 
    G.Lohmann and J.Drazenowic - were then the Oldenburg Field office of B.V..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the signed statement 
    of G.Lohmann made to this 'Group of Experts' has not been returned by B.V. 
    and thus cannot be made an enclosure to this report, his career and involvement 
    in Meyer Werft newbuildings including VIKING SALLY shall be outlined as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Günther Lohmann was 
    born in 1929 and started his professional career in 1944 as shipbuilding apprentice 
    with HDW-Hamburg and stayed with this yard until 1956. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 01.05.1956 he 
    started as consulting engineer with engineer H. Rössler VD at Oldenburg and 
    carried out newbuilding inspection and superintendent work for various owners, 
    also non-exclusive surveyor work for B.V. (expert adjoint N.E.) until end 
    of December 1976. From 01.01.1977 he was senior surveyor and exclusive surveyor 
    for B.V. in charge, i.e. responsible, for the Oldenburg office. His district 
    extended from Cuxhaven to Bodenwerder and to the Dutch border, i.e. the Meyer 
    Werft in Papenburg belonged to his area. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He remained in this 
    position until the end of March 1994, whereafter he retired, however, was 
    recommissioned shortly afterwards as a field surveyor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his capacity 
    as senior surveyor of the BV-Oldenburg office he supervised to a varying extent 
    the newbuildings APOLLO, DIANA, VIKING 1, 3, 4 & 5, DIANA II, and VIKING SALLY 
    on behalf of Bureau Veritas. Over the years he developed a very good relationship 
    to the responsible people of the Meyer Werft. This included for example the 
    work force who used to consult him whenever they had technical questions to 
    make matters acceptable to class. He also had close contact with representatives 
    of the National Authorities as well as owners' representatives who, as far 
    as VIKING SALLY is concerned, were members of the Johansson family, Captain 
    Brunström, and chief engineer Lars Karlsson.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> His main duties 
    were to make sure that the vessels were built according to the approved drawings 
    in relation to the rules and in accordance with sound workmanship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In line with these 
    activities he had also carefully inspected the construction of the bow visor 
    of VIKING SALLY, its installation, fitting of hinges, and welding of bushings. 
    Furthermore, he did attend the watertightness test before and during trials. 
    He recalls having been in the inner side of the visor during trials out in 
    the North Sea together with the von Tell representative, somebody from the 
    owners and also from the Yard, when it was discovered at full speed that some 
    water was leaking through the rubber packings. Consequently local adjustments 
    of the rubber packings were considered necessary and were made after the return 
    to Emden, whereafter a hose-test confirmed watertightness of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He has been shown 
    various pictures of the visor hinges with severe burning marks as found after 
    the casualty and confirmed that what is visible on the pictures would never 
    have been accepted by him, because it does not conform to the standard workmanship 
    of the Meyer Werft, and further, is not in agreement with what he had seen. 
    This also relates to the visor lug. The vessel would never have left the Yard 
    in this condition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He drew attention 
    to the fact that at the same time when VIKING SALLY was under construction 
    the yard was also building tanks for gas tankers which he also inspected on 
    behalf of B.V., in particular the welding seams, where the requirements are 
    very strict. Frequently the same welders were working on VIKING SALLY as well 
    as on the gas tanks. Therefore, he was known to have the tendency to overstress 
    his requirements as to the quality of welding seams in general. He was sometimes 
    criticised for applying the same standard when checking the quality of the 
    welding seams for gas tanks and normal vessels such as VIKING SALLY.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As to the Atlantic 
    lock he stated the same as he did above in respect of the hinges: The welding 
    seams visible on the pictures shown to him would never have been accepted 
    by him, because they do not conform to the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft 
    which he did survey.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary, senior 
    surveyor G.Lohmann and his assistant J.Drazenowic did carry out the newbuilding 
    supervision, apparently as required and as necessary in good co-operation 
    with yard workers, F.B.N. inspectors, and subcontractors, e.g. G.Todsen and 
    H.Brandt representing von Tell AG. Reportedly they made sure by random checking 
    that the vessel was built in accordance with the approved drawings, the requirements 
    of the rules and the standard workmanship of Meyer Werft.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The Yard, as well 
    as von Tell, were sending 4 copies of each drawing to be approved to BV-Hamburg 
    of which</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 was returned 
      with approval<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent 
      to head office Paris<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was sent 
      to Oldenburg office <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1 was kept 
      in Hamburg office </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the B.V. surveyors 
    were at the yard practically every day where they had their own office they 
    also received drawings directly from the yard before these drawings were received 
    from BV-Hamburg with the approval stamp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to the fact that 
    during the first weeks after contract signing it was generally assumed that 
    the entire foreship area would be more or less identical to DIANA II lots 
    of drawings were just copied and marked 590. This refers also to drawing 1106 
    - Interlock of Bow Visor - which shows the visor hinge construction on both 
    sides of visor and vessel including the hinge plates. Also this drawing was 
    taken over from DIANA II, consequently showed the hinge plate construction 
    as installed on board this vessel, i.e. with 4 hinge plates each side on the 
    vessel, each being 30 mm thick, i.e. in total 120 mm, with fixed bolts. (See 
    attached photo showing DIANA II - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.40.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.40</a>) The drawing 1106 showing the above explained DIANA II construction 
    was sent to BV-Hamburg for approval by letter of 07.11.79. Due to owners' 
    wishes and with the consent of the B.V. surveyor, this hinge plate design 
    was changed in December 1979 from 4 to 2 hinge plates of 60 mm thickness each, 
    and the fixed bolts were changed to the floating-bolts system. In consequence 
    the total thickness of 120 mm (initially 4 x 30 mm, subsequently 2 x 60 mm) 
    remained unchanged (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.41.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.41</a>). Drawing 1106 and the respective detail drawings for production 
    were changed on 02.01.80 as per <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.42.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.42. </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The revised drawing 
    1106 was sent by letter of 09.01.80 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.43.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.43</a>) to von Tell GmbH for approval and the same day to BV-Hamburg 
    for approval (Enclosure 2.4.3.44). Moreover the drawing was also handed over 
    to Lohmann at the yard. The drawing was returned by von Tell already by letter 
    of 15.01.80 without comments, i.e. approved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. returned the 
    approved drawing 1106 only on 30.06.80 (approval date 20.06.80), but the approved 
    drawing was the one sent on 07.11.79 for approval with the DIANA II version 
    of hinge plates. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has to be assumed 
    that upon return of the approved drawing 1106 - at a time when the vessel 
    had been fully accepted by the class, was delivered to owners and had left 
    for the Baltic already - the yard just looked for the approval and put the 
    drawing into the archive not noting that it was the wrong one which had been 
    approved. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">What happened inside 
    the B.V. organisation is unknown to this 'Group of Experts', however, it is 
    a fact that the B.V. surveyors at the yard were provided with a continuous 
    stream of new drawings simultaneously with the drawings being sent to BV-Hamburg 
    or elsewhere. Therefore, this 'Group of Experts' concludes that senior surveyor 
    G.Lohmann must have had drawing 1106 in the VIKING SALLY version, latest when 
    he inspected the "connection of the visor to the vessel" on 28.03.80 according 
    to his notebook (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.38.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.38</a>) because there can be no doubt that a senior surveyor with the 
    experience of G.Lohmann would have noted at once that there were just 2 instead 
    of 4 hinge plates at each of the hinges unless he was aware of the changes 
    and had the corrected drawing at hand.</font></p>

    is made to the letter of B.V. of 10.01.95 to the JAIC (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On page 5, B.V.

      the bow door and bow ramp control and monitoring devices were checked by 
      the Finnish Authorities against the new IMO requirements.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is denied by 
    the Finnish Authorities, i.e. the F.B.N., because in their opinion the locking 
    devices of the visors are not their responsibility, but have to be looked 
    after by the Classification Society (which was confirmed by the retired principal 
    surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office - Lars Olof Ålander - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.44.2</a>). This will be discussed in more detail in Subchapter 2.4.4. 
    B.V. further discusses in their letter of 10.01.95 the <i>"Bow door cleating 
    and monitoring arrangements" </i>and remarks with regard to the manual side 
    locks: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»2 manually 
      operated fasteners for heavy weather with limit switches on bolts (open 
      and closed position).«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since it was confirmed 
    by ESTONIA's 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür in his statement dated 03.10.94 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.183</a> - and also by the system engineer Henrik Sillaste and the motorman 
    Tanel Moosaar during their interview on 10.03.95 -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.4.278.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 21.2.4.278 </a>- that it was the boatswain's duty to close these 
    manual side locks whenever heavy weather was forecasted, it has to be assumed 
    that this was common knowledge to both crews of ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The statement of 
    B.V., that these manually operated fasteners were connected to limit switches, 
    however, does not refer to the newbuilding condition when such switches were 
    not installed. It has to be assumed that B.V. either mixed up the limit switch 
    for the indication "visor closed", which is installed in way of the port manual 
    securing device or the limit switches were installed subsequently, which is 
    unlikely. Also the following statement of B.V. is partly wrong: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The overall 
      cleating was surveyable from a mimic panel (red and green lamps for each 
      cleating group) both at the local control station and on the navigating 
      bridge; video monitoring of the car deck included a view of the ramp closure.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The overall cleating, 
    i.e. locking devices, was surveyable only from a mimic panel with red and 
    green lamps for each cleating group located in the control station (control 
    panel) on car deck behind the bow ramp but not on the navi-gating bridge. 
    The panel on the bridge just showed one red/ one green each for visor and 
    bow ramp, i.e. the green lamp went on only when the visor was closed and secured, 
    i.e. all respective limit switches had contact. The same refers to the bow 
    ramp, i.e. the ramp had to be pulled tight against the rubber packings, and 
    all 4 securing bolts had to fully engage the mating pockets and contact the 
    sensors; only then would the green lamp indicate the bow ramp being closed 
    and secured.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:<br>
      </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
      to the wiring diagram for the locking devices the sensors of the Atlantic 
      lock were not connected to the bridge panel which thus initially showed 
      "green" when the visor was closed and just the side locks were closed. According 
      to Captain Haakan Karlsson this had been rectified in 1990/91 when the ferry 
      was taken over by Silja Line.</font></p>
