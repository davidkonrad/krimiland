  General </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The requirements 
    for emergency and lifesaving equipment are governed in detail by the SOLAS 
    Convention. The vessel was built to SOLAS 1974, <b>but the first PSSC was 
    issued on a form which referred to SOLAS 1960</b> (see 2.4.4.). The F.B.N. 
    surveyed the vessel for compliance with the requirements while she flew the 
    Finnish flag, and B.V. surveyed on behalf of the E.N.M.B. during the following 
    period assisted by the Swedish Shipinspec as far as the take-over was concerned. 
    The surveys were annual and the surveys in connection with the change of flag 
    were performed by senior staff members of B.V. and Shipinspec at Turku and 
    in Tallinn. For details reference is made to Subchapters 6.4 - 6.5.</font></p>

  Lifeboats and Rafts </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was equipped 
    with ten motor-driven lifeboats of open type and of fibre-glass construction. 
    The first boat on the starboard side - lifeboat no. 1 - was a man overboard 
    (MOB) rescue boat, i.e. the emergency boat. Two boats were equipped with searchlights. 
    The boats were suspended under davits on deck 8. Embarkation was from deck 
    7. The vessel also carried 63 inflatable rafts, which were packed in containers 
    stowed on decks 7 and 8 and were equipped with hydrostatic release mechanisms. 
    Twelve rafts were equipped to be launched by davits, four of which were installed 
    on deck 7. The remaining rafts were intended to be dropped into the sea. With 
    one exception, the rafts were manufactured in 1980 and delivered to the VIKING 
    SALLY during construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    JAIC lifeboats and rafts provided on board satisfied the SOLAS 1974 requirements 
    as to number and standard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The lifeboats and 
    rafts were surveyed every year in conjunction with the issuance of the Passenger 
    Ship Safety Certificate. The last survey was in June 1994.</font></p>

  Lifebuoys and Lifejackets</b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was equipped 
    with 18 lifebuoys, nine of them with self-activating lights. One lifebuoy 
    on each side of the ship was equipped with a lifeline and with self-activating 
    light and smoke signals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were 2298 lifejackets 
    for adults and 200 lifejackets for children on board. All the jackets were 
    equipped with whistles. There were no lights on the lifejackets. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the open passage 
    on deck 7, rescue stations and bins containing lifejackets were located on 
    both sides of the ship. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Final Report 
    of the Joint Accident Investigation Commission does not mention whether there 
    were survival suits and/or immersion suits on board and/or in the lifeboats/rafts. 
    When being interviewed by Erik Ridderstolpe on 17.12.97 the technical director 
    of N&T and boardmember of Estline, Sten-Christer Forsberg, stated: <i>"The 
    poor, overaged safety equipment was accepted by Sjöfartsverket. Otherwise 
    we would have renewed it."</i></font></p>

  Emergency Beacons (EPIRB)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The ESTONIA 
    carried two emergency beacons (EPIRBs) of type Kannad 406F. The last check 
    of the radio beacons was reported to have been made about one week prior to 
    the accident by the radio operator. This check confirmed that the EPIRBs were 
    in full working order. </font></font></p>

  Emergency Alarm Systems </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ship had an alarm 
    system incorporating 197 alarm bells and 11 alarm sirens.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system 
    was function tested once a week. The audibility of the system against the 
    background noise in the accommodation areas had been judged to be adequate, 
    although no documented measurements had been made.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarms were installed 
    in the passageways and public spaces as well as in non-passenger areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The alarm system 
    operated on the 220 V system and was connected to the main- and emergency 
    generator systems. The alarm system was not powered by the emergency batteries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Alarm buttons were 
    installed on every deck, including the sections and work rooms of the crew. 
    By pressing an alarm button an audible signal was triggered off on the navigation 
    bridge and an indicator showed which section the alarm was coming from. In 
    case of no reaction within 30 seconds, the alarm in the entire vessel was 
    automatically activated. The receipt of one signal on the bridge did not prevent 
    the receipt of additional signals from other alarm buttons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The public address 
    system was operated from the navigation bridge and also from the Information 
    desk. The microphone on the bridge had priority over the one at the Information 
    desk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A separate personal 
    paging system for crew members was installed. </font></p>

  Escape Routes and Instructions</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The escape 
    routes led to 18 rescue stations located on deck 7. The routes were marked 
    with signs on the walls and fluorescent tape along the corridors.</font></font></p>

  Passenger Information</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">According 
    to the JAIC each passenger cabin was supplied with an instruction pamphlet 
    in Estonian, Swedish and English on safety measures describing how to react 
    in the event of an emergency. It is said that there also was an evacuation 
    scheme posted in each cabin indicating the escape routes and the particular 
    rescue station for the passengers accommodated in that cabin and that the 
    exits and emergency exits were marked by arrows in passageways, on staircase 
    landings and in recreation areas as well as by signboards on exit doors.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In any distress 
    situation, besides alarms given only to the crew, the passengers <b>should</b> 
    be given general information and instructions through the public address system.
