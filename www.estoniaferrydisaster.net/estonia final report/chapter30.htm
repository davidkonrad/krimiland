  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1 and 2 - show 
      the visor ashore at Hangö in the position as it had been attached to the 
      ship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 3 - shows the 
      large indentation at starboard side of which the larger, lower part was 
      probably caused by contact with the bulbous bow. This larger indentation 
      extends down to the gap at the stempost. There was already a rather deep 
      vertical indentation from a previous occurrence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">4 - shows the upper 
      part of the large indentation which looks completely different, although 
      the indentation from below extends into this severely corroded and apparently 
      previously indented area without any coating whatsoever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 - shows the collapsed 
      stempost area. The stempost was found to have cracked four times - see drawing 
      6 - apparently by fatigue, of which the lower crack penetrated completely 
      some time before the casualty and the lower part, F 3 on the drawing, had 
      disappeared leaving a gap in the stempost respectively a hole in the bottom 
      of the visor. The drawing No. 6 also shows that the INERTA ice paint - last 
      applied in January 1994 - had penetrated the cracks F 1, F 3 and F 4 up 
      to 50% of the thickness of the stempost. This means that the stempost had 
      been cracked through up to 50% already in January 1994. See also Subchapters 
      12.5 and 34.4.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 5.1 - shows the 
      lower forward part of the visor with the deep vertical indentation (arrow 
      2) of old origin, the gap in the stempost area caused by the ice knife on 
      top of the bulbous bow, the small indentation at the starboard side (new) 
      which is apparently casualty related and the large deep indentation at port 
      side (old) which is of old origin and was probably caused by contact with 
      ice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 7 and 8 - show 
      the bent-off starboard aft part of the bulwark. This damage occurred probably 
      when the visor was hammering on the bow ramp and the ferry was severely 
      heeled to starboard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 9 and 10 - with 
      drawing (10) incorporated show the visor bottom and arrow 1 points to the 
      indented stempost/bottom plating. The reason for this indentation was the 
      misaligned visor as indicated on the drawing, i.e. the forepart of the visor 
      overlapped the forepart of the forepeak deck to such an extent that the 
      stempost of the visor was no more resting on the stempost of the forecastle 
      deck, but that the stempost part of the forepeak deck was in contact with 
      the bottom plating of the visor which was neither designed nor dimensioned 
      to carry the weight of the visor. Therefore the bottom became firstly indented 
      and subsequently holed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Evaluation:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There were 
      2 very heavy damages in the visor which were of old origin and which had 
      led to a change of alignment and geometry of the visor when they occurred 
      which increased during the subsequent time and which has contributed to 
      the casualty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The large damage 
      to the starboard shell plating was apparently sustained in two stages, viz. 
      at first the corroded upper part occurred and subsequently the larger lower 
      part, which extends into the upper part, occurred. Since it is already rather 
      unlikely that the upper part of the damage did occur during the final stage 
      of the casualty sequence-of-events by contact with the bulbous bow, it can 
      be excluded that the 3 sharp and deep transverse indentations to the port 
      side of the centre line were caused by contact with any part of the bulbous 
      bow because there is no corresponding counter-piece. The picture below shows 
      all the indentations in the forepart of the visor. The arrow indicates the 
      3 horizontal indentations of which the upper and lower ones are rather deep. 
      It has thus to be assumed that the visor had been in contact with some other 
      object either before the casualty scenario began or after it had ended, 
      possibly during the attempts to raise the visor.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) At least 2 fatigue 
    cracks had penetrated the stempost already by about 50% when ice paint was 
    applied the last time which was between 10 and 14 January 1994 in the shipyard 
    at Naantali. During the following nine months up to the casualty the cracks 
    had to propagate further and the lowest one did fully penetrate the stempost 
    which led to the breaking away of part F 3 (see drawing below) and the creation 
    of a corresponding hole in the visor bottom and, consequently, the faster 
    flooding of the visor inside at sea.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The visor was 
    misaligned to such an extent that its forepart was overlapping the stempost 
    of the forepeak deck - see drawing behind this page and picture 9 on sheet 
    1 - which had serious consequences for all the relevant parts of the visor 
    such as locking devices, hinges, rubber packings and, last but not least, 
    the weather tightness of the visor. Nothing fitted anymore. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The drawing behind 
    this page summarizes the findings and indicates the condition of the forepeak 
    deck and the lower part of the visor including the lug of the Atlantic lock 
    before departure for the last voyage. </font></p>

    below drawing shows the fatigue cracked stempost from the side and from forward.

    </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There is no sheet 
    available for this part of the visor. The pictures show the inside of the 
    aft part of the ramp house with 9 vertical webs each at its forward- and aft-parts. 
    The webs are of the hp profile-type and measure 160 x 7 mm. The 4 webs at 
    the port side of the aft part - numbered 6 to 9 - were indented to varying 
    extent as can be seen on the picture below. Web 6 was evidently just slightly 
    touched while web 9 was pushed flat. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The report of the 
    Finnish expert to this 'Group of Experts', Captain Peter Jansson, about the 
    subject matter reads as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Undamaged webs 
      are abt. 155 mm high. There are 9 pcs webs in all Webs # 1 to 4 from the 
      sb side are essentially undamaged, but the paint has been scraped off all 
      of them in a line abt 20 mm down from the ramphouse upper horizontal surface 
      plate (top).<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Web 
      # 5 is already very slightly deflected towards port and measures at 150 
      mm (against 155, see above). Web # 6 is deflected so that 140 mm remains, 
      # 7 has 100 mm, # 8 has 60 mm and # 9 has 20 mm standing, while the rest 
      of that web has been deflected to port. The depth of damage (deflection) 
      is thus quite linear between webs 6 and 9. However the point of max damaged 
      paint at # 1 to max deflection at # 9 seems to follow a gentle curve dropping 
      downwards as you look to port. The ramphouse after plate with the damaged 
      webs below.«</font></i></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage configuration 
    revealed by the above measurements indicates that the visor must have been 
    misaligned by 4°-5° in forward/aft direction if the indenta-tions should have 
    occurred by contact with the bow ramp, i.e. the port side of the visor had 
    to be about 300 mm further forward than the starboard side. In other words, 
    the port side of the visor must have moved forward while the starboard side 
    was held back. Before such forward movement of the visor is possible at all 
    and contact between the aft part of the visor's ramp house and the upper part 
    of the bow ramp is possible, several initially built in obstacles have to 
    be overcome as demonstrated by the drawing on the following page.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> These are:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the visor 
      hinges have to break and the visor has to move forward; <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the lugs 
      for the actuators underneath the visor arms have to cut 120 mm through 8 
      mm forecastle deck plating until they will strike against the strong transverse 
      deck beam at frame 159; <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) the lugs 
      will have to cut through this transverse deck beam at frame 159, which is 
      only possible after several forward/aft movements of the visor;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    forces necessary for the lugs to cut through this frame have been calculated 
    by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg to have been about 200 ts. This 
    means a point load of ca. 100 ts at the port side and a point load of ca. 
    100 ts at the starboard side. See Subchapter 34.12.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the visor 
      has to move 360 mm forward before the aft webs of the ramp house (160 x 
      7 mm) can come in contact with the upper part of the bow ramp;<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) the (empty) 
      visor weighing 55 ts, of which the main part is still absorbed by the forepeak 
      deck, will then lean on the properly closed and locked bow ramp;<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) as the 
      break-load of the 2 ramp hooks was 42 ts each, i.e. 84 ts, and the break-load 
      of the 4 securing bolts was 25 ts each, i.e. in total the break-load of 
      the bow ramp's locking devices was 184 ts, the visor will lean against the 
      ramp and nothing will happen as it is proven by the MARIELLA incident described 
      in Chapter 33.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This, however, was 
    not the ESTONIA scenario because some of the initially built in obstacles 
    were no more in existence, viz. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(g) the visor was 
      no more watertight but water-filled to the outside level which increased 
      its weight to about 200 ts, and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(h) the bow 
      ramp was most probably not secured at all - see Subchapter 29.2 and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(j) visor 
      hinges and locking devices were considerably damaged/worn and their load-carrying 
      capacity was reduced to a fraction of its original value.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Therefore, and due 
    to other circumstances, a casualty scenario as described in Chapter 31 was 
    able to develop which led to the sinking of the ESTONIA and which requires 
    a detailed examination in order to find out what actually caused the indentations 
    to webs 6 - 9 inside the ramp house of the visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The damage 
    is most extensive at web 9 and then decreasing until web 5 which, as well 
    as the starboard side webs 1 - 4, are not affected at all - see picture below. 
    The visor must have been misaligned by ca. 4-5° in relation to the bow ramp 
    being connected to the vessel.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg959.jpg" width="349" height="232"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The arrow indicates 
    the point of contact on web 9. The next frame 5, which is the centre line, 
    and the following frames to starboard have no marks at this level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    when web 9 came in contact with the port side of the bow ramp and was pressed 
    together from 160 mm to 20 mm the corresponding web 1 at the starboard side 
    of the ramp house was 360 ./. 160 = 200 mm away from the starboard side of 
    the bow ramp. Due to the narrow construction, such a misalignment of the visor 
    is not possible as long as the visor lugs move within the forecastle deck 
    area aft of the deck-beam at frame 159 and as long as both actuators are connected 
    to the B-deck. As will be shown on sheet P 4 + S 4 this was no more the case 
    with the foundation of the port actuator. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also visible 
    on the two pictures above are slight scorings inside the ramp house from web 
    1 through web 9 which could indicate a slight contact at another time, earlier 
    or later (see red arrows on both pictures). The scoring marks are just below 
    the brackets between vertical/horizontal webs which would be the areas of 
    contact when visor and bow ramp are in normal condition as on the drawings. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the points 
    of deepest indentation on webs 6 through 9 are, however, located about 300 
    mm deeper, this indicates that the visor was at its normal height at the time 
    of this contact, but raised by about this distance in relation to the upper 
    part of the bow ramp. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There is, however, 
    the much more realistic possibility that the port side of the bow ramp came 
    in contact with this particular area inside the ramp house when the visor 
    was hanging on the ramp at a rather late stage of the casualty scenario. Then 
    the vessel was on the side and the visor was close to sliding off the ramp 
    due to the vessel heeling some 120°/130°. This will be explained in Chapter 
    31 - The Casualty Scenario. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper 
    transverse crossbar inside the visor shows respective damage - see arrow 1 
    on the picture below - the corresponding part at the port outer longitudinal 
    girder of the bow ramp does not. This is confirmed by the image further down,

    video made on 09.10.94 which shows the port outer girder underside of the

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is obvious that 
    this quite heavy damage shown on the picture on page 961 was caused by impact 
    - see close-up below - and that this impact did not happen too long ago because 
    the cracked paint is still hanging loose. It cannot have been caused by the 
    ramp, at least not at an early stage as explained before. The damage must 
    have been caused when the visor was labouring on the ramp for more than 30 
    minutes until the heel of the vessel was sufficiently big to let the visor 
    slide off the ramp. During this time, this and other damage to the </font></p>

    - arrow 1 on the photo on page 961 - at the starboard side of the same crossbeam 
    in way of the first stringer level are not casualty related because except 
    for the middle one the respective areas cannot be reached by the bow ramp. 
    It has to be assumed that these scorings were caused by other means before

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) There may 
      have been a previous however light contact between visor and bow ramp when 
      both were in normal condition to each other. Such contact could not be explained 
      by this 'Group of Experts', because contact between ramp and ramp house 
      under normal conditions is only possible if the visor hinges are broken 
      or disconnected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) There has 
      however been a stronger contact between the port side of the bow ramp and 
      the port webs of the ramp house only when the visor was misaligned in relation 
      to the bow ramp by ca. 4°, i.e. the port side of the visor was about 300 
      mm more forward than the starboard side, a condition which was only possible 
      after the hinges had failed and the lugs under-neath the visor arms had 
      broken through the deck beam at frame 159. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) This is supported 
      by the apparent fact that the bow ramp was not locked and the visor was 
      water-filled to the outboard level and was weighing about 200 ts, instead 
      of 55 ts in empty condition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The bow ramp 
      did not crash into the visor onto the cross-beam at 1st stringer level and 
      did not cause the respective damage on port side because neither the corresponding 
      part of the bow ramp nor the corresponding part of the starboard side of 
      the same cross-beam do show any damage of similar nature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Consequently 
      the bow ramp was not pulled open when the contact occurred which caused 
      the indentations/scorings to the four port webs in the aft part of the ramp 
      house. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It has however 
      to be assumed that this contact occurred in the final stage when the visor 
      separated from the vessel and the bow ramp was kicked up by the port aft 
      bottom part of the visor as it will be explained in Chapter 31 - The Casualty 
      Scenario. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally attention 
    has to be drawn to one indentation pushed at each side into the forward deck 
    beam of the visor, i.e. the lower side of the forward part of the ramp house 
    as indicated on the two pictures on the next page. According to drawing on 
    page 956 the port indentation is 240 mm away from the inner bulkhead and the 
    starboard one 325 m. This means that these indentations were most probably 
    caused by the bell cranks being the most upwards extending parts of the bow 
    ramp. This must have occurred at a time when the visor was hanging on the 
    bow ramp already, i.e. the contact area having been the part inner bulkhead. 
    Therefore the distance between bow ramp and port inner bulkhead has as small 
    as possible - 240 mm - while the opposite distance between the bow ramp and 
    the starboard inner bulkhead was as big as possible - 325 mm. This is also 
    the explanation for the apparent fact that the port inner bulkhead was very 
    severely distorted and partly cracked while the starboard inner bulkhead remained 
    completely unaffected even without paint scratches. See also S 4 and P4 - 
    The Inner Bulkheads - further down.</font></p>

      starboard as it had been the case for the last hour, or - was already rolling 
      to both sides - though more to starboard than to port - about 1 or 2 minutes

  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The welding seams

      1 on pictures a and c.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The surface of

      the space between bushing/hinge plate, which should be sealed airtight by

      facts are considered to be established: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The recovered 
      steel and bronze bushings as well as the securing plate are not original. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The welding 
      seams between visor hinge plate and steel bushing are consequently also 
      not original which is also confirmed by the weak dimensions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The welding 
      seams were cracked and an attempt had been made to close the cracks by welding 
      which resulted in welding material penetrating through the crack into the 
      much too big gap between the hinge plate and steel bushing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The space 
      between the hinge plate and steel bushing shows heavy corrosion which indicates 
      that the welding seams had been cracked and penetrated some considerable 
      time before the casualty and, consequently, the much too big space between 
      hinge plate and steel bushing was exposed to the outside air and wetness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The inside 
      of the hinge plate was covered by deep burning marks whereas the outer surface 
      of the steel bushing was unaffected. Consequently the old steel bushing 
      had been burned out by flame-cutting. Each burning mark is a crack starter 
      from where cracks propagated into the hinge plate material to various depth. 
      This led to further weakening of the hinges and to a considerable reduction 
      of the load carrying capacity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) Also the bronze 
      bushing was installed rather unprofessionally and not shrunk in as it was 
      done at newbuilding. - See the statements of G.Todsen - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      2.4.2.21</a>. After it was noted that the bronze bushing turned inside the 
      steel bushing, fitting keys were installed - see further Subchapter 34.4.

      showed two areas of hammering. The distance between both areas does not 
      coincide with the distance between the hinge plates fitted on the forecastle 
      deck. The port hammering mark is directly adjacent to the outer hinge plate 
      indicating that the visor and vessel were heeled to starboard at time of

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer 
      lug plate is completely untouched while the inner lug plate shows very deeply 
      engraved scraping marks. This means that at the time when the lug plates 
      were cutting through the deck plating and the deck beam the vessel must 
      have heeled already considerably to starboard. Therefore the centre of gravity 
      of the visor had shifted from forward to starboard and the force direction 
      was no more to forward/downwards but starboard/downwards. Thus the weight 
      of the visor in athwartships direction was now carried by the inner port 
      and the outer starboard lug plates because the locating horns gave no more 
      transverse support as the visor had moved too much forward.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) As the lug 
      plates underneath the starboard visor arm were both badly affected, the

      failed first. At that time the vessel was only slightly heeling to starboard 
      but rolling and consequently both the inner and the outer hinge plates were 
      affected. The port hinges remained intact for the time being. The starboard 
      side of the visor moved - in slightly raised condition - forward/aft a couple 
      of times when the vessel was still only slightly heeling to starboard and 
      was rolling, whereafter the starboard heel increased considerably and also 
      the port hinges broke. Only thereafter also the port lug plate started to 
      cut first through the deck plating and then through the deck beams. At that 
      time the heel to starboard must have been that big already that the outer 
      port lug plate did not come in contact with the steel parts cut through 
      by the forward parts of both lug plates - see the picture above. </font></p>

    The cracks had developed during some considerable time before the casualty

    propagate more quickly during the last month before the casualty because of

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent fact 
    that this stiffener (3) had been disconnected from the B-deck (5) respectively 
    since the last repair was never really fitted to it, is further confirmed 
    by a part of the welding seam - see arrow 8 - on the previous two photos - 
    apparently being soaked with oil while the stiffener below is unaffected. 
    This means that this stiffener was not welded to the B-deck.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the 
    following facts are considered to be established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The outer 
      stiffener of the port actuator foundation shows an old temporary repair 
      with very poor welding seems in its forward part. Due to the corrosion visible 
      on the previous photos it has to be assumed that this improper repair was 
      carried out already some considerable time before the casualty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The stiffeners 
      show relatively straight cracks directly below the forward and the aft ends 
      of the lug plates. Therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the stiffeners 
      were affected by fatigue cracks and thus pre-damaged. The cracks had developed 
      during some considerable time before the casualty due to load changes during 
      the opening and closing of the visor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The B-deck 
      was also affected by fatigue as already explained for the stiffeners. This 
      fact is indicated by the condition of the ripped off deck remains. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The port inner 
      stiffener was no more the original one since firstly it did not show any 
      protecting coating and secondly was only spot welded to the deck - if at 
      all. All stiffeners were however fully welded to the deck by the shipyard 
      during new-building, as it can still be seen on the starboard actuator foundation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) The load carrying 
      capacity of the port visor actuator was considerably reduced. </font></p>

    have been caused at any time during the long process of separation from the

      likely because the crew was trying to hold down the visor by the actuators 
      but the port one broke off due to the poor connection to B-deck.</font></p>

      being the thickest part with direct contact to bulkhead and internals during 
      the breaking through process. Therefore cover and screws show severe hammering 
      marks and the clamping ring is missing which was probably stripped off the 
      piston when it was pulled through the bulkhead. Also the damage picture 
      of the port front bulkhead - see P 4 in Chapter 29 - does confirm the above

    12.4.3.157</a> - Subchapter 12.4 - both lugs had frequently been burned off 
    when the crew was unable to open the side locks hydraulically upon arrival 
    in Tallinn. Obviously they were subsequently rewelded to the same location. 
    </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is also obvious 
    from the condition of the starboard lug as can be seen from the two video 
    images of the corresponding lug still attached to the bolt on the wreck that 
    the lugs had been repeatedly cut off and rewelded. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The very thick welding 
    seam on the lower part - see arrow 1 - is actually a build-up of several welding 
    seams, i.e. weld on top of the previous weld without grinding away of the 
    remnants. It is obvious that the bulkhead part attached to the lug - see arrow 
    2 - had not been torn out of the bulkhead during the casualty scenario but 
    much earlier because, due to the thickness of the accumulated welding seams, 
    this original part of the visor bulkhead (Viking Line colour) could not come 
    in contact with the adjacent visor plating. Consequently, it has to be assumed 
    that each time the lug was cut off by burning it was just stuck into the respective 
    hole in the bulkhead and welded from both sides, if at all - see also Chapter 
    29 - S 4.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next pictures 
    - also taken from the JAIC's Report - show the upper parts of the holes in 
    the visor bulkheads where the lugs had been fitted.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The analysis and 
    comparison of both pictures reveal the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The plating 
      around <b>the port</b> holes is unaffected. Some remains of welding seams 
      are visible at the upper right corner and at the right (inside) there are 
      indications that welding seams could have been there. At the outside (left 
      side) there are no such indications which refers also to the upper hole. 
      Only few spots of corrosion can be seen. In summary it has to be assumed 
      that the lug had not or only to a very limited extent been welded from the 
      outside. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The plating 
      around<b> the starboard</b> opening looks completely different because the 
      plating is distorted, the stiffener at the inside is torn off the bulkhead, 
      the plating had apparently been exposed to heat and subsequently became 
      corroded. The steel part between the small hole and the bigger opening was 
      pushed upwards, obviously by the lug then and still attached to the vessel, 
      i.e. the visor made a downward movement in relation to the lug, i.e. the 
      vessel. Thereby the lug was pressed into said steel part. The indication 
      of the remnant of a welding seam is visible at the upper right corner of 
      the big opening. Otherwise there are no indications of welding seams at 
      all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lugs of 
      the visor's side locks were obviously not welded to the plating, but there 
      were permanent holes in the plating of both sides through which the lugs 
      were stuck and welded from the inside only. Thereby it was possible to adjust 
      the part of the lugs extending the plating to the length required by the 
      ever changing misalignment of the visor. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, attention 
    has to be drawn to both aft parts of the visor deck shown on the two pictures 
    overleaf. The corroded areas indicated by arrow 1 on both sides have been 
    the spots where the visor had been welded to the vessel at the time when the 
    bushings of the starboard visor hinges were renewed. This was the time when 
    ESTONIA berthed in Tallinn stern first - see the statement of Torbjörn Cederqvist 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.157.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 12.4.3.157</a>

    area below the pocket for the locating horn does not show any rubbing marks 
    - contrary to the starboard side - which leads to the conclusion that the 
    rubber packings at the front bulkhead of the vessel were missing also in this 
    important location - see arrow 1.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The pressure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following facts 
    are considered to be established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Due to the 
      vertical misalignment of the visor the port side of the visor was raised 
      by 100 or more mm which made it impossible for the locating horn fitted 
      at the port front bulkhead of the vessel to enter the mating pocket of the 
      visor. Instead contact occurred in the area below the pocket - as the visor 
      was raised - and the plating became damaged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The crew fitted 
      several doublers and support brackets in way to compensate for the stress 
      created by the misalignment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The lug of 
      the hydraulic side lock including the plating part to which it was welded 
      had apparently been cut off and rewelded several times without grinding 
      off the remnants of the previous welding seams. This led to the very thick 
      welds with substantially reduced load carrying capacity of the side locking 
      device of the visor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The rubber 
      packings in way of the area below the pockets for the locating horn were 
      either missing at the front bulkhead of the vessel or had not been in contact 
      with the corresponding parts of the visor bulkhead due to misalignment. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The area around 
      the location of the lug of the hydraulic side lock is not pushed out, nor 
      do smoke marks exist. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The hooks of 
      the manual side lock are just slightly bent together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The recess 
      at the upper part of the port aft bulkhead of the visor was damaged when 
      the visor was moving transversely respectively athwartships. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(8) The lower part 
      of the aft bulkhead is not affected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (9) The plating 
      between forecastle deck and visor arm is cracked and the steel pads protecting 
      the rubber packings were hammered flat by crew members attempting to lower 
      down the port side of the visor which was extending the forecastle deck 
      of the vessel by 100 mm or more. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the opinion of 
    this 'Group of Experts' the bottom had been held back by the Atlantic lock 
    until it finally also broke when the visor fell to starboard until it rested 
    on the bow ramp. - See Chapter 31. - It is also obvious that the visor had 
    overlapped the forepeak deck considerably to the effect that the forepeak 
    deck had penetrated the inside of the visor bottom up to ca. 0.5 m. This must 
    have given the visor the main support against falling off to starboard, because 
    the bow ramp alone could not have carried the entire weight of the visor after 
    the Atlantic lock had failed. - See Subchapter 34.5. - The damage picture 
    of the strong ice strengthened hull plates on both sides of the collapsed

    The scoring marks enlarged on picture 8 indicate visor movements from starboard 
    forward to port aft whereby the pyramid only came in contact with the aft 
    half of the pocket due to the extensive misalignment of the visor as demonstrated 
    by the detail drawing D1 - on Sheet 6. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">5 - shows a very 
    sharp damage to the port aft edge of the visor bottom which probably occurred

    lug being part of the Atlantic lock. Arrow 1 points to the previously burnt 
    off part of the lug with cracks propagating from burning marks (arrow 2). 
    The lug apparently became twisted to starboard when the visor moved abruptly 
    to starboard until its port inner bulkhead rested on the port side of the 
    bow ramp. The deep crack in the bottom of the visor to port of the lug confirms 
    this. It further indicates that the visor lug was about to crack off the visor 
    bottom when the lugs on the forepeak deck failed first. This is underlined 
    by the impressive picture below indicating an upwards and to starboard movement 
    of the visor when this big crack propagated and came to a stop when the lugs 
    on the forepeak deck failed. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The visor

      bottom structure of the visor which supported the visor during the increasing 
      heel of the vessel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The gap in 
      way of the collapsed stempost of the visor was caused when this part fell 
      on top of the ice knife on top of the bulbous bow. The very strong ice plates 
      consequently bent up to both sides of the collapsed stempost provided further 
      support to the visor and also prevented its falling off to starboard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The scoring/scraping 
      marks inside the pocket for the pyramid do confirm the vertical and forward/aft 
      misalignment of the visor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The very sharp 
      damage at the port aft edge of the visor bottom was caused when the visor 
      moved athwartships in the final stage of gliding off the bow ramp, the forepeak 
      deck and finally the bulbous bow to the bottom of the sea. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The visor lug 
      of the Atlantic lock almost cracked off at the bottom when the visor moved 
      forwards and to starboard, however, then the lugs of the forepeak deck broke 
      first and the crack propagation stopped. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The visor lug 
      was considerably elongated due to wear in 141/2 years of exposure to changing 
      loads and the manipulations by Christer Koivisto.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (7) The basic 
      primer of the visor lug is yellow which is an indication that it is still 
      the original lug as the initial primer at newbuilding was of such colour. 
      See also Subchapter 2.4.6. The basic primer of the starboard lug of the 
      Atlantic lock was found to be grey by the JAIC which is a further confirmation 
      that this as well as the other two lugs were not the original ones anymore. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(8) The stempost was cracked 
      4 times well before the casualty and the crack had penetrated the stempost

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    that these deep indentations cannot have been caused when the port actuator

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the actuator

    it is shown by the following picture. Arrow 1 indicates the area at the edge 
    of aft and inner bulkheads where the aft bulkhead is slightly extending the 
    inner bulkhead and where metal parts were torn off when the actuator moved 
    into its jammed positions. A detailed evaluation of this and other pictures 
    did reveal that neither the actuator nor its foundation had come in contact 
    with the bulkhead which is due to the angle between the fastening point at 
    the lugs below the visor arm and the bulkhead edge. The actuator was able 
    to swing into this position because of its spherical bearings which allow 
    deviation of up to 15° to each side. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is thus proven

    damage area under discussion. This shall be explained in more detail in Chapter

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The above-mentioned 
      damage was exclusively caused by the bow ramp, the port actuator has not 
      been in contact with the bulkhead plating. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The opposite 
      starboard inner longitudinal bulkhead is completely unaffected, thus there 
      has been no contact with the bow ramp.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The above 
      explained severe damage at the port inner longitudinal bulkhead in connection 
      with corresponding damage at the port bow ramp - see Subchapter 29.2 - The 
      Bow Area - and witness evidence - see Enclosures 29.6.414 / 29.6.415 - confirms 
      that the visor had been resting on the bow ramp which caused the damage 
      to the port inner bulkhead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) Due to the 
      absence of damage/scorings forward and aft of the existing damage approximately 
      in the middle of the port inner bulkhead it has to be assumed that the visor 
      fell off the bow ramp / forepeak deck towards the starboard side by force 
      of gravity once the heel was sufficient, i.e. 130°/140°.</font></p>

    and the vertical beam as well as the cross-beams. Arrow 2 indicates the area 
    on the vertical beam which took the main weight of the ramp. Arrows 1 and 
    3 indicate the damage respectively scoring marks on the cross-beam which cannot 
    have been caused by the bow ramp at the early stage, because there is no corresponding 
    damage at the ramp and, also, the lower parts, being almost at the underside 
    of the beam, are unreachable for the bow ramp under any condition.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation 
    for these marks respectively damage on the cross-beam on both sides can be 
    seen on the drawing 3., i.e. contact with the bell cranks on both sides at 
    the top of the ramp already before the casualty when the visor opened/closed 
    due to the slightly open and misaligned ramp (could no more be properly closed) 
    and the misaligned visor. In particular the port bell crank is damaged very 
    severely which was, of course, mainly caused by the contact with the port 
    inner bulkhead of the visor. On the other hand, it has to be assumed that 
    this already existing damage was exaggerated when the ramp was inside the 
    visor and the visor hanging on the ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2 - shows the lower 
    inside of the visor with the lower transverse beam in way of the 3rd stringer. 
    This beam was found to be very severely scored and scraped, which was most 
    probably caused during the lifting operation. The picture also demonstrate 
    the very severely set up visor bottom which is underlined by the close-up 
    No. 10 and explained by detail drawing No. 8. There are two further contact 
    marks in way of the deck beam at the lower forward part of the ramp house, 
    viz. in the most port and most starboard frame spaces, which were evidently 
    also caused by the bell cranks of the ramp when the visor moved further forward 
    and downwards and the vessel was already severely heeled to starboard already. 
    See also sheet 2 - The Ramp House. The picture below indicates the short distance 
    to the port bulkhead because of the starboard heel. </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The upper cross-beam 
      shows damage at two locations on the port side which cannot have been caused 
      by the bow ramp, because there was no corresponding damage at the ramp. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The damage 
      on the port side of the upper cross-beam and the scraping marks on the starboard 
      side were caused during opening/closing of the visor by the bell cranks 
      fitted on both sides at the top of the bow ramp. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The damage 
      to the vertical beam was caused when the ramp was resting inside the visor 
      on this beam with a flap in between. This flap in the centre line of the 
      ramp is heavily damaged. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The vertical 
      beam as well as parts of both sides of the 2nd stringer and the adjacent 
      frames are thickly covered with hydraulic oil. It has not been possible 
      so far to verify from where this oil originates and what caused this quite 
      substantial spill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) There are 
      two contact marks at the deck beam below the forward part of the ramp house, 
      one at the starboard and one at port. The port one is closer to the adjacent 
      bulkhead than the starboard one indicating that the contacts occurred when 
      the visor was heeled to starboard and resting on the bow ramp. The contacts 
      occurred with the bell cranks of the bow ramp when the bow ramp was pushed 
      upwards. </font></p>

    oil floating on top of the water inside the visor and which settled down on 
    the stringers and elsewhere when the water flowed out of the visor accumulated 
    in the forward part of the 3rd stringer - see arrow 4, apparently because 
    this part of the visor was deeper than the aft part which must have been the 
    case for a longer time already because the brackets at both sides of this

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently the 
    following facts are considered to be established:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) The visor's 
      fore part had been lower than the aft part since some considerable time 
      before the casualty which is another confirmation for the severe and increasing 
      misalignment and deformation of the visor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The port area 
      of the 3rd stringer was severely set up with the frames buckled since some 
      time before the casualty probably the ice winter 1994 when the vessel frequently 
      forced ice. This damage extended up to the 2nd stringer and into the adjacent 
      frames and brackets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) The visor 
      had always been full of water to the outside level when the vessel was at 
      sea. See the photo below.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The hydraulic 
      cylinders/pipes were leaking which caused hydraulic oil to swim on the water 
      surface inside the visor which settled down once the water left the visor. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) People had 
      been very active inside the visor, in particular on the 3rd stringer. The 
      majority of the footprints are fresh and not covered by oil, thus originate 
      from the time before arrival and after departure Tallinn on September 27, 
      1994. </font></p>
