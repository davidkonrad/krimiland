  The development of the safety organisation</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">When the operation 
    of the ESTONIA was taken over by ESCO in 1993, the new safety organisation 
    was based on the safety plan of their previous vessel on the same route, the 
    NORD ESTONIA.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All documents, plans 
    and manuals included in the safety system were in both Estonian and English, 
    and the safety organisation was implemented at all crew levels prior to commencement 
    of traffic. The safety organisation was tested during the operational control 
    in Tallinn before the ferry commenced trading, see Subchapter 6.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The safety organisation 
    and the training and implementation thereof were described in the emergency 
    plan, the safety manual and the training manual.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>Reportedly 
      due to the fact that the NORD ESTONIA had no radio operator and consequently 
      was not included in the safety plan, the radio operator of the ESTONIA - 
      as well as all the Swedish/Finnish advisers - had no functions in the safety 
      list of the ESTONIA.</font></p>

  Alarm signals</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Various types 
    of alarm were used on board the ESTONIA. The lifeboat alarm and fire alarm 
    were general alarms, addressed to passengers and crew. Besides these there 
    was a coded alarm <i>"Mr. Skylight"</i> addressed only to the crew and intended 
    to alert relevant parts of the safety organisation. The alarms were described 
    in the emergency plan and in the safety manual available at various locations 
    in the crew accommodations such as mess rooms, day rooms and all major workplaces. 
    The different alarms are explained as follows: </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Lifeboat 
    alarm </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lifeboat alarm 
    - seven short sound signals, followed by one long one - was given repetitively 
    with the alarm bells and/or the vessel's horn. When the alarm was given, the 
    command group, the port and starboard boat groups, the engine control group 
    and the eleven evacuation groups were alerted.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Fire 
    alarm</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The fire alarm - 
    continuous repetitive short sound signals - was also given with the alarm 
    bells and/or the vessel's horn. When the alarm was given, the command group, 
    the two fire groups, the engine control group, the control group, the port 
    and starboard boat groups and the first aid groups were activated.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>"Mr. 
    Skylight"</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Without alarming 
    the passengers, the crew could be alerted over the public address system with 
    the coded message <i>"Mr. Skylight"</i>. This message could also be used with 
    a suffix. Depending on which suffix, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>in case of fire:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>"Mr. Skylight 
      to No. 1",</i> means for the fire groups to proceed immediately to "Fire 
      Station No. 1".<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Mr. Skylight

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
      to other sources "Number One" meant "Deck 1" and "Number Two" meant "Deck 
      2", etc. which, however, is not in accordance with the "Safety Plan" attached 
      as Supplement No. 226 to the Report of the JAIC. "Mr. Skylight to number 
      one and two" according to this plan means that Fire Group 1 should proceed 
      to Fire Station 1 (underneath the bridge) and Fire Group 2 should proceed 
      to Fire Station 2 on the aft part of the car deck.</font></p>

      crew members have testified to having heard <i>"Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 
      2"</i> over the loud speaker after the excessive heel at 01.02 hours and 
      thus assumed that there was a fire and tried to reach their respective fire 
      stations at the beginning (e.g. see statement of 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The safety organisation 
    was led by a command group mustering on the bridge. The command group consisted 
    of the master, the chief engineer, the chief officer, the chief purser and 
    the third officer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The master was the 
    overall commander of the operations. The chief engineer was the fire chief, 
    commanding the two fire groups and the engine control group. The chief officer 
    was responsible for stability calculations and was also the deputy fire chief. 
    He commanded the port and starboard lifeboat groups, the first aid group and 
    the helicopter groups. The chief purser was responsible for evacuation, the 
    evacuation group reported to him through forward and aft zone leaders. The 
    third officer's main responsibility was to record times of events and to take 
    notes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    emergency plan and the safety manual, the chief officer - not the radio officer 
    - was responsible for external radio traffic. The reason for this is that 
    the safety organisation for the ESTONIA was copied from organisation of the 
    NORD ESTONIA. This ferry had no radio officer.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b><font size="3">7.3.4<br>
    Training and drills</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The various groups 
    in the safety organisation drilled according to the vessel's exercise schedule. 
    The drills were led by the group leaders, who also made a report of the content 
    of the drill and of any group members absence. This report was submitted to 
    the responsible officer in the command group. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fire groups, 
    the engine control group and the boat groups were scheduled for training every 
    two weeks, and the first aid group and the evacuation groups were scheduled 
    to exercise once a month.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the ESTONIA 
    commenced her traffic between Tallinn and Stockholm, an operative control 
    was carried out on board by the Swedish Sjöfartsverket, which has been described 
    in Subchapter 6.5.2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 2 February 1994 
    the ESTONIA also participated in a major bomb exercise, the RITS &Ouml;vning. 
    The report is attached in Swedish as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/7.3.4.129.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    7.3.4.129.1</a> and a summary of the report in English is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/7.3.4.129.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    7.3.4.129</a>. The threat that a bomb might explode in the sauna and swimming 
    pool compartments half way between the Estonian and the Swedish coasts, i.e. 
    approximately in the actual casualty position, was simulated. The purpose 
    of this exercise was to train the co-operation between the shore-based, helicopter 
    landed anti-terrorists experts with bomb dogs, etc. and the vessel's safety 
    organisation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly the exercise 
    was a great success and ESTONIA's crew was said to have performed well. </font></p>
