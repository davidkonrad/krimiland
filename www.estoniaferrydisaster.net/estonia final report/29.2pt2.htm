    in full length, it is, however, accessible and the diver has been very close! 
    It would be very surprising if this hook as well as the port one had not been 
    inspected during the first diving inspection, when the first diver lost his 
    wristwatch in the bow ramp which was found during the second inspection by 
    diver 2. The video for the second inspection is available, however, not for 
    the first one.</font></p>

    were still in position, but bent inwards. The damage picture is actually opposite 
    to what it should be if the bold would have engaged an intact pocket and the 
    bow ramp would have been forced open. Then the top plate would have been pushed

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Unfortunately the 
    video quality is extremely poor because when the diver saw the pushed in condition 
    of the pocket he started to rub it with his glove and the picture became totally

    and are made more clear by the drawing next to the image below.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The diver started 
    to explain this unusual and unexpected damage in this location, but was stopped 
    by the supervisor who said:<i> "They are just interested whether the bolt 
    is fully extended."</i> The diver, turning away from the crushed pocket: <i>"The 
    bolt is fully extended." <br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The only 
    possibility of such damage being caused in such a location was by closing 
    the ramp by force when the bolt was already extended. Therefore, it has been 
    assumed that the bolt had been extended when the ramp was closed some time 
    before the casualty and the top plate and the adjacent longitudinal plate 
    were pushed in, as visible. Never since this occurrence was it possible to 
    close and lock the ramp properly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> No. 1.2.3 -<i> </i><b>The 
    port upper mating pocket</b> was found to be intact and undamag-ed, just the 
    metal of the side plates was slightly cracked according to the diver. There 
    are two pictures available showing the pocket and the extended bolt (according 
    to the diver fully extended) which can be seen below.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both pictures clearly 
    indicate the misalignment between bolt and pocket which is - according to 
    the diver - about 4 inches or 100 mm, i.e. the pockets were about 100 mm above 
    the bolts (when the vessel was in upright condition).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> No. 1.2.4 - The<b> 
    port lower mating pocket</b> was completely undamaged. The diver found a rope 
    turned around the pocket which had obviously been done by somebody prior to 
    the sinking. The rope runs up between ramp/bulkhead where it is jammed in 
    and still visible on the 1996 video tape.</font></p>

    between pocket and bolt as observed already at the upper pocket/bolt is apparent 
    from the picture below, which also shows that the securing bolt was only slightly

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lower end of 
    the piston rod was mating between the two lugs con-nected by a strong bolt 
    to the ramp. The landings at both sides were of rather strong construction 
    similar to those for the two mating lugs for the ramp hooks. The drawing on 
    the next page shows the ferry with open visor and closed bow ramp. The two 
    landings on each side extending the ramp sides are clearly visible (see arrows).</font></p>

    Due to the ramp being pressed to starboard the port recess of the front bulkhead

    The following<b> images of 02.10.94 </b>show the area of interest with the 
    ramp in the foreground, the extended landing for the fastening of the actuator 
    to the right, 3 Teco lines rising up and the openings for the hydraulic and 
    manual lock in the front bulkhead. The recess with the opening for the actuator 
    and the actuator are not visible. The ramp appears to be more or less in normal 
    closed condition.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The next image made<b> 
    from the video taken on 09.10.94 </b>shows the gap between ramp and the longitudinal 
    part of the recess to be much wider, i.e. the ramp was now shifted more to 
    starboard compared to<b> the situation on 02.10.94. </b></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image 
    from the same video also shows changed rope positions and a box attached to 
    the longitudinal part of the recess of the front bulkhead directly above the 
    opening with the ramp actuator fastening (when the ramp was in closed condition). 
    This box is visible on the videos made on 02.10.99 only as a shadow but apparently 
    it was there already. The reason for this difficulty is the much smaller gap 
    between bulkhead and bow ramp at that time. The box will be explained further 
    in Chapter 32.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg834.JPG" width="398" height="228"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Not only did the 
    gap increase between 02. and 09.10.94, but also more Teco lines (floatable 
    mooring lines) were rising up between ramp and bulkhead. One of them appears 
    to be turned around the box which must have been manmade. This is surprising 
    because at that time "officially" no divers had been down to the wreck. <br>
    The next available images are made from the<b> ROV and diver videos of 01. 
    to 04.12.94</b> and show the same area, however, again with remarkable changes.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The box and all 
    the hawsers but one have disappeared, the gap appears to be wider.<br>
    Close ups made from the diver videos of the one hawser left proved it to be 
    jammed in between the extended landing for the actuator fastenings and the 
    bulkhead - see the image below. To the left is the ramp landing and to the 
    right the bulkhead. It is obvious that such jamming can only occur when the 
    ramp was moved open/closed which must have been the case between<b> 09.10.94 
    and 02.-04.12.94.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following images 
    - also made from the diver video B40c - show the lower part of the opening 
    for the actuator with the actuator inside and above the lower part of the 
    landing for the fastenings of the actuator extending the side of the bow ramp. 
    <b>Underneath this landing the rather massive construction of the fastenings

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The actuator 
    </b>can be seen on the following image inside the opening in slightly extended 
    condition with the lug at the bottom end of the piston rod broken. The slight 
    extension of the actuator corresponds to a ramp opening of some 10-15 cm at 
    the top. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image 
    shows the complete lower part of the opening looking from upside down (in 
    normal condition). The actuator with the broken lug of the piston rod (bright 
    spot) is visible and - behind the actuator - in almost upright condition some 
    object which upon a very detailed video evaluation turned out to be an angle 
    iron. The two dark areas in the white paint of the bulkhead proved to be two 
    deep indentations obviously caused by the angle iron under pressure.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The enhancement

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated before 
    in Chapter 27 it has to be assumed that the crew fitted the angle iron in 
    place to support the closing operation, i.e. to ensure smooth closing of the 
    port side of the ramp which was detached from the vessel due to the broken 
    hinges and which was considerably pressed down during opening and closing 
    of the ramp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The starboard 
    actuator</b> area looks totally different compared to the port one because 
    there is very heavy damage, the probable cause of which shall be explained 
    in Chapter 32. Among other things also the fastening of the starboard actuator 
    to the bow ramp was affected. All available images from this part of the ramp 
    are made from the ROV video of 09.10.94, thus show the ramp pressed against 
    the starboard longitudinal bulkhead part of the recess. For orientation purposes 
    the first image below shows the transverse girder at the bottom in the middle 
    which runs up diagonally to the left where a large crack is visible. The strong 
    girder running from left middle to right up is the starboard outside longitudinal 
    girder. At the port side of the mentioned transverse the landing for the fastenings 
    of the port actuator were fitted, at its starboard side the fastenings for 
    the starboard actuator were fitted.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next image shows 
    the underside of the burst open landing. At the left side of the picture the

    manual side lock.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next image is 
    a close-up looking slightly more from below (in normal condition) which clearly 
    shows the full extent of damage to the burst open landing. The landing was 
    pushed upwards and the steel structure burst open. Behind the two triangle-shaped 
    brackets below the damage the broken piston rod is visibly jammed in (see 
    arrow). It broke in the lug at the bottom end of the piston rod approximately 
    in the same way as the bottom end of the piston rod of the port actuator had 
    broken.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A further close 
    up of the very small gap between the ramp (below) and the recess respectively 
    front bulkhead (above) shows deep scoring marks indicating an opening movement 
    of the ramp and - obviously - closing thereafter as assumed already from the 
    indications at the port side.</font></p>

    shows the area of the damaged landing at the right top side and then to the 
    left edge of the ramp with the recess and a piece of the front bulkhead behind 
    respectively above, but the strong outside girder very severely bent to the 
    inside of the ramp with both ends cracked off the transverse girders.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bottom (right) 
    side of the girder was attached to the lowest transverse girder of the bow 
    ramp to which at the bottom side of the hinges are fitted. For clarification 
    purposes the important details on this image have been numbered as follows:</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the ramp mainly 
    covers the opening for the actuator only a small part of the lower area is

    the top (arrow 1) is the opening for the actuator, the broken part of the 
    piston rod can be seen at the right below the big bright spot (arrow 2). The 
    bent steel to the right are parts of the landing blown open (arrow 3). As 
    it is quite obvious that the broken piston rod is some distance away from 
    the opening, it must have been broken twice, viz. first in the lug of the 
    piston rod the same way as on the port side and subsequently, and again when 
    the ramp was forced into closed condition, after the 02.10.94. The following 
    image was made from the same video tape B40c when the diver was looking between 
    ramp and bulkhead. It shows the lower part of the opening for the ramp actuator

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the pictures/images/drawings 
    shown and explained on the previous pages 847-855 demonstrate the following 
    condition of the bow ramp hinges:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Each hinge consisted 
    of two lugs - one inner, one outer lug - connected to the ramp, one lug connected 
    to the vessel, one hinge bolt and one bearing/bushing. The bolt was secured 
    by one plate at each side which were bolted to the bushing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Evidently the bolt 
    of the port outer hinge had moved inside the bearing/bushing and had broken 
    the securing plates which were missing at both sides. The reader is reminded 
    that already the last Finnish crew had demanded the renewal of this hinge. 
    See also Subchapter 3.4 and 6.5.1.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently 
    due to the misaligned ramp the bolt worked itself to starboard until the outer 
    lug shipped off the bolt, which apparently caused the inner lug to fail. See 
    right the drawing below (PS outside).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg856.JPG" width="361" height="166"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The additional load 
    caused also the port inner hinge - see the left drawing (PS inside) above 
    - to fail after some time leaving the bow ramp detached from the vessel at 
    the entire port side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The detachment 
    of the complete port side of the ramp from the vessel resulted in </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) an increasing 
      misalignment of the whole ramp, and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) an increasing 
      gap between the ramp and the ramp opening of the car deck.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Furthermore the 
    bow ramp in its function as part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead 
    above bulkhead deck was no more weathertight, i.e. the car deck was open to 
    the sea as the visor was always quickly water-filled at sea.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The gap between 
    bow ramp and car deck ramp opening at the port lower corner extended from 
    the corner to the centre line and upwards to about B-deck level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In way of this 
    gap mattresses, plastic sheets, plastic covered bedding, blankets and rags 
    were found, obviously serving as "sealing material".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - As a result of 
    the port ramp side being detached from the vessel there was also a vertical 
    misalignment between the port ramp side and the adjacent plating of the car 
    deck opening, i.e. the mating lug for the ramp hook and the mating pockets 
    for the securing bolts extending from the adjacent plating were about 100 
    mm higher up now and could no more be reached by the hook respectively by 
    the bolts already for some time before the casualty, i.e. the port side of 
    the bow ramp could not be secured at all for some time before the casualty. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It follows that 
    the entire port side of the bow ramp was not locked/secured upon departure 
    from Tallinn on 27.09.94.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The starboard 
    inner hinge was still intact, but the ramp lugs were subsequently elongated, 
    i.e. worn, and they would have been the next ones to fail. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Also the strong 
    outer starboard hinge showed signs of wear and elongation and hence had lost 
    its initial load-carrying capacity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - This means that 
    at the time of the casualty the bow ramp was merely connected to the vessel 
    by the weaker inner and the stronger outer starboard hinges, both of which, 
    however, were substantially worn and hence their load-carrying capacity was 
    reduced correspondingly.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Damage to 
    the construction</b> - (See drawing page 869) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The inside of 
    the bow ramp</b> is only briefly visible when the diver climbs up the starboard 
    side to the flaps at car deck level, pulls himself up along these flaps to 
    the port side hinges and further to the lower securing bolt with mating pocket. 
    On the ramp plating there are two areas with burnt and/or damaged paint, i.e.: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- There is an area 
    of ca. 1 m² located between the upper flaps and the level of the car deck 
    opening where the paint is burnt and the plating is severely distorted. The 
    area is inside the ramp house when the ramp is closed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower area 
    is located in the 3rd row of steel profiles, looking from starboard, which 
    are welded to the ramp plating and the 6th or 7th profile from car deck level 
    as indicated on the picture below by the dark spot. The paint of the plating 
    as well as the two flaps below looks reddish/brown. The plating otherwise 
    does not look affected, but the two flaps are bent and distorted and the car 
    deck plating in way appears to be affected.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Otherwise the ramp 
    plating appears to be intact as far as visible. The rails are completely missing 
    on both sides. - See Subchapter 27.6 and further below in this chapter.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The flaps on the 
    lower side of the ramp normally covering the gap between car deck and ramp 
    were found to be as follows (from starboard to port):</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the flap Nos. 
    1 and 2 were green and intact and upright;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- No. 3 looked 
    brownish/red, was also upright with the upper edge bent;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- No. 4 looked 
    intact, brownish/red and upright;<br>

    looked new and green, were upright and undamaged except for a bent edge of 
    the No. 8.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Through the gap 
    between the last flap and the car deck, something big and red, probably bedding

    <b>raised edge along the port side of the ramp</b> is not detached from the 
    ramp anywhere, but buckled and smashed at its forward part as well as the 
    complete forward part of the ramp including the bell crank for the flaps. 
    It was noted when the diver moved down (up) along the port side of the ramp 
    from the port lower pocket of the securing bolt to the upper side that the 
    upper part of the raised edge (tire-protection bar) with lug for the preventer 
    wire and upper pocket for the securing bolt were bent towards the inside, 
    i.e. centre line, of the ramp. This bending under force is presumably the 
    cause for the cracked metal between the upper pocket and ramp edge as explained 
    further above under "locking devices".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The lugs for both 
    preventer wires are completely intact and undamaged and the conditions of

      horizontally with damage in between;<br>
      - Nos. 7 and 8 were hanging down in undamaged condition with the lower parts 
      slightly moved to port. <br>
      The bell crank on port side was bent and broken with the wire controlling

    port side of the ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Otherwise there 
    is no more apparent damage to the inside of the bow ramp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The<b> outside of 
    the bow ramp </b>was found to be damaged very substantially and the damaged 
    areas, according to the ROV inspections on 02. and 09.10.94 compared to the 
    results of the diving investigation on 03.12.94, are demon-strated by the 
    drawing on the following page. It has to be borne in mind that the green shaded 
    area containing the really heavy damage at the centre line of the transverse 
    girders Nos. 3, 4, 5 as counted from the lower side of the ramp is not visible 
    on the videos made on 02. and 09.10.94. This does not mean that it had not 
    been there, but this particular area cannot be seen on the publicly available 
    video footage, because these parts were cut and deleted from the respective 
    videos handed over to this 'Group of Experts' by the members of the Finnish 
    Commission in March 1995 as "raw material". - See Subchapter 34.6.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>In detail:</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The red shaded 
    area represents the contours of the forepeak deck and it is obvious that the 
    damage to the 2nd transverse girder as well as to the two inner vertical girders 
    appears to have been caused by contact with the corresponding parts of the 
    forepeak deck. Also the type of the deep and sharp indentations of the transverse 
    and vertical girders, with local deformations to the adjacent structure, could 
    confirm this. On the other hand the damage to the port vertical girder is 
    comparatively weak, while the most heavy damage to the starboard vertical 
    girder cannot have been caused by contact with the forepeak deck because the 
    two ramp hinges on that side were to some extent intact. The doubts are further 
    increased by the fact that the flatbar housings on the forepeak deck at the 
    four contact areas should be pressed flat, which they were not, and that there 
    should at least be heavy contact marks at the deck edges of the forepeak deck, 
    which however are also missing.</font></p>

    heavy weight pressing down the ramp from port to starboard and by which the 
    very heavy distortions to the vertical and transverse girders of the ramp 
    structure were created.<br>

    explain all the damages to the ramp structure except for Nos. 1, 10 and part 
    of damages 13/14 to which reference is made in Chapter 32. It is worth mentioning 
    here that there was no chance for the ramp to crash on the bulbous bow as 
    long as the starboard ramp hinges were intact, which they were.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(5) The rails</b><br>
    The bow ramp is fitted with two rails on each side as can be seen on the photo

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Each rail consisted 
    of three fixed sections welded to the raised tire-protection bar, i.e. 4 vertical 
    stanchions with three horizontal rail bars in between. A fifth moveable section 
    was fitted to the most forward stanchion. When the ramp was open these movable 
    sections were swung forward and secured in this position by two pins fitting 
    in corresponding holes. Before the ramp was closed, the movable sections were 
    swung backwards and secured by the pins as can be seen on the above picture 
    and the rails remained in this position during the sea voyage. Thus it has 
    to be assumed that this was also the case during the last voyage. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As parts of 
    the starboard rail, the 4th section with the attached 5th moveable section, 
    were found on the seabed already on 02.10.94 by ROV "Jutta II" - see the image 
    on the next page - the available footage has been evaluated for indications

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious that 
    it is the starboard side because the movable part is always fixed at the inside 
    of the fourth section if the ramp is open, as visible here and it is also 
    obvious that the lower, bent part was the part attached to the ramp. It is 
    further apparent that the vertical stanchion had been bent and finally cracked 
    off by a force acting from port to starboard. </font></p>

    securing bolt. Bending or cracking can be excluded due to the even surface 
    of the stanchion which was actually a pipe. At the time of cutting the stanchion

    that the ramp had been more open and was subsequently closed - see the image 
    on the next page. Since this area is not visible on the footage of 02.10.94,

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The arrow points

    that these pallets floated into this position at the very moment when the 
    ramp was pushed closed by the visor while the sinking vessel was already heeling 
    to 130/140°. It has also to be excluded that the pallets floated out of the 
    jammed-in condition by themselves as visible on the footage made on 09.10.94. 
    This means that it has to be assumed that the pallets were manually put into 
    position to avoid total closure of the ramp at some stage and, further, that 
    they probably floated away when the ramp was also manually opened further 
    at sometime after the 09.10.94 but before 03.12.94.<br>

      at the starboard side from forward of the Atlantic lock to the "corner of 
      the mouth" and these were in a rather poor condition. Along the whole port 
      side up into the "corner of the mouth" there were no rubber packings. The

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These pictures need 
    to be commented as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The support 
      bracket at the outer side of the lug (arrow 1) is larger than the original, 
      which is evident because it overlaps the end of the welding seam (arrow 
      2) which marks the end of the bushing. The support bracket is about 12 mm 
      larger compared to the original one made according to the von Tell drawing 
      No. 49111- 373.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The oblique 
      end of the bracket is just burnt, not grinded (arrow 3). It is considered 
      impossible that the bracket would have left blacksmith's shop of the Meyer 
      Werft in such a condition - see also Subchapter 2.4.6; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The remains of 
      the welding seams at the outer side of the lug were made very unprofessionally 
      when the lug was upright which allows the conclusion that the lug was fixed 
      to the vessel as otherwise the welder would have laid the lug flat. This 
      would have permitted easier welding and would have produced a qualified 
      welding seam. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Qualified 
    welders are able to identify if a welding seam was made when the components 
    were lying flat or were standing upright. The starboard and the centre lugs 
    were shown to one of the very qualified welders of Meyer Werft who identified 
    the welding seams at the support bracket and on the outside of the starboard 
    lug to be rather poor repair welds made when the lug was upright, i.e. fitted 
    to the forepeak deck. See also Subchapter 2.4.6. - As the welds had been made 
    when the lug was upright, i.e. welded to the vessel, it is excluded that they 
    could have been made by Meyer Werft because the bushings were welded to the 
    lugs in the workshop, i.e. the lugs had been lying flat. - See Subchapter 
    2.4.6.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The welds are 
      thin and interrupted, respectively cracked, because they are so thin, which 
      is demonstrated by the corroded surface of the inner side of the lug normally 
      covered by the bushing. As long as the welding seams are intact the space 
      between bushing/lug is airtight, i.e. without oxygen, which was burnt by 
      the heat of the welding process. This was obviously no more the case since 
      some time before the bushing was torn off, because substantial corrosion 
      was able to develop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The forward 
      and aft welding seams between bushing and support bracket are not connected 
      at the outer end (or closed, as the welders say), thus water could penetrate. 
      This confirms the unprofessionalism of the welder who did these repair welds. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Although the 
      welding seams of the inside of the starboard lug and of both sides of the 
      centre lug look much better, they have to be considered fill-up welds according 
      to the Meyer Werft welders, because the welds are higher than the inside 
      of the lug, i.e. the bushing was not resting in the lug, either because 
      the bore was too big from the beginning and/or the lug became elongated 
      as time went by. Therefore the welding seams were mainly used to cover the 
      space between the lug and the bushing at the bottom side of the lugs and 
      thus had only a reduced load-carrying capacity compared to the original 
      as-built condition.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
    26 June 1994 a passenger observed welding work being carried out underneath 
    the open bow ramp while ESTONIA was in Stockholm. It is possible that the 
    repair weldings explained above to starboard lug of the Atlantic lock were 
    carried out then. See also Subchapter 12.5.</font></p>

      Stenström, because allegedly the helicopter taking the Swedes back home 
      could not carry the weight ashore of both the bolt and the ship's bell.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The drawing previously, 
    is explained in detail as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The contact 
      plate (Arrow 1) had originally been straight as can be seen from the above 
      drawing which is copied from the original von Tell drawing 4911-373 dated 
      09.10.79. It has been confirmed by the von Tell representative G.Todsen 
      (Enclosure 2.4.2.21 - Statement G.Todsen) as well as by the BV-surveyor 
      G.Lohmann in a personal discussion that the Atlantic lock had been installed 
      as per approved drawings. Consequently the contact plate was originally 
      straight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - This was no 
      more the case at the time of the casualty as can be seen from images 13/15 
      and from the image below made from the ROV videos of 02.10.94 and 09.10.94, 
      because evidently the contact plate was bent from starboard to port when 
      the bolt was in original condition. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg906.JPG" width="318" height="297"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explanation 
    for the bent contact plate of the bolt was presented by the last chairman 
    of the JAIC and its Estonian part, Uno Laur, already at a meeting on 17.01.95 
    in his office in Tallinn when also a member of this 'Group of Experts' was 
    present. He was asked whether he had an explanation for the many fresh footprints 
    on the 2nd and 3rd stringers inside the visor and he replied as follows:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The inside of 
      the visor was not tight and filled quickly with seawater up to outboard 
      level when the vessel was on full speed at sea.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All hydraulic 
      installations, i.e. also the actuators of the Atlantic lock, the bow ramp 
      and the visor were leaking. This caused hydraulic oil to float on the water 
      surface inside the visor. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As soon as the 
      vessel reduced speed and consequently the bow wave became smaller, the water 
      streamed out of the visor and the hydraulic oil settled on the stringers, 
      bottom, etc. - as explained in Chapter 30.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the Atlantic 
      lock could no more be closed hydraulically already since some time before 
      the casualty (probably since the ice winter, March/April 1994) crew members 
      had to go down inside the visor each time before arrival and after departure 
      Tallinn and hammer the bolt open respectively closed through the deformed 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock. Thus they walked from forward to aft and back 
      over the stringers through the freshly settled oil which caused the footprints 
      as can be seen on the next pictures. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above was 
      confirmed by another participant of the meeting, Captain Arvi Myyryläinen, 
      then Hull Manager of The Pohjola Insurance Group, Helsinki. His statement 
      is attached as Enclosure 12.5.175. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The photograph 
    on the next page was made mid January 1995. It shows a view into the visor 
    with the partly oil stained 2nd stringer (arrow 1) and the completely oil 
    covered stringer 3 (arrow 2).</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg908.JPG" width="349" height="232"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Also the picture 
    on the next page shows in detail that the footprints were so fresh and clear 
    that even the size of the rubber boots could have been identified. It also 
    demonstrates that there must have been quite some activities down in the visor 
    before the last arrival and after the last departure from Tallinn which cannot 
    just be explained with one or two men going down to hammer the bolt of the 
    Atlantic lock open and closed. There were certainly also other activities 
    going on as will be explained later. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    last time the hydraulic oil settled down on stringer 3 has been before arrival 
    Tallinn in the morning of 27.09.94 when the speed was reduced, the bow wave 
    became small and the water streamed out of the visor. Thereafter the crew 
    entered the visor to hammer open the Atlantic Lock and possibly to carry out 
    other activities. The crew went again inside the visor after departure to 
    hammer the bolt into the Atlantic Lock lugs and to carry out other activities. 
    Subsequently the vessel picked up speed, the bow wave was raising again and 
    the inside of the visor filled within the following hours more or less completely 
    with water, which only left with the lifting of the visor after the casualty. 
    Consequently the fresh footsteps originate from before arrival and after departure 
    on 27.09.94.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The opening movement 
    of the bolt was from starboard to port and the contact plate was bent from 
    starboard to port. Therefore it has to be assumed that the crew hammered against 
    the contact plate to open the bolt, because there is no other possibility 
    of forcing the bolt open. The hammering marks on the plate are clearly visible. 
    When closing the bolt they hammered directly against the bolt (which is not 
    possible for opening), i.e. against the 2 lugs between which the piston rod 
    of the hydraulic cylinder was fastened by a little bolt. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As can be seen 
    by the next pictures both lugs were bent to the respective outsides and the 
    piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder was also bent.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg910.JPG" width="346" height="310"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Whilst the bending 
    of the lugs is doubtless due to the powerful hammering by crew members when 
    trying to force the bolt through the deformed lugs of the Atlantic lock, it 
    is evident from the hammering marks on the contact plate, as visible on the 
    next image, that they sometimes also hammered against this plate when trying 
    to open the bolt. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following 
    image, taken from the Part-Report of the JAIC, shows these lugs to be full 
    of hammering marks, which are shining like new, without any traces of corrosion, 
    although the fracture surfaces of the broken lugs are heavily corroded. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg911.JPG" width="295" height="209"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It appears strange 
    that hammering marks, undoubtedly originating from hammering about 6 hours 
    before the casualty, appear without any corrosion as can be seen on the above 
    image, whilst fracture surfaces, which are said to originate from fracturing 
    at the time of the casualty, i.e. were exposed to seawater only about 6 hours 
    later, are severely corroded as can also be seen on the same image. This raises 
    doubt whether the lugs of the Atlantic Lock really fractured only during the 
    casualty or much earlier already. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- Further detailed 
    explanations: </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A further consequence 
    of the water-filled visor were repeated problems with the magnetic limit switches 
    of the Atlantic lock which had replaced the mechanical sensors sometime in 
    1985/86 - see Subchapter 3.4 - and which controlled the red/green indicator 
    lights of the control panel on the car deck (see Subchapter 2.6.4). These 
    limit switches were most probably damaged by ice hacking inside the visor 
    in winter 1994. When this was realised by those in charge and when it further 
    turned out that the Atlantic lock could no more be operated hydraulically 
    because the lugs were deformed also by ice hacking and the visor was misaligned, 
    it was decided to dismount the damaged limit switches completely and the cables 
    were cut off. The video prints below show the cut off cables and the empty 
    sensor plate.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg912.JPG" width="370" height="321"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The motivation for 
    not replacing the dismounted magnetic limit switches was primarily the rather 
    high price for new ones and the apparent fact that crew members had to go 
    down anyway after the closing respectively before the opening of the visor 
    to close respectively open the bolt manually by hammering, thus there was 
    a direct control and no remote control was required.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Neither B.V. 
    nor the E.N.M.B. were informed about this severe violation of safety rules 
    which rendered the vessel initially unseaworthy and should have caused B.V. 
    to withdraw the class in hindsight.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
    the information outlined above was brought to the attention of B.V. they invited 
    the owners, i.e. N&T, to comment on the dismounted limit switches and the 
    obviously cut-off cables. Although the images from the underwater videos demonstrate 
    quite clearly that the limit switches and cables were not torn off in the 
    course of the casualty sequence-of-events, B.V. apparently finally believed 
    the many crew witnesses stating that the installation had been complete and 
    in proper working order only a few days before the catastrophe. Also the JAIC 
    finally accepted the explanations by N&T/the crew, although earlier there 
    had been different opinions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Image<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Nos. 13/16 
    are showing the bent contact plate attached to the bolt on the piston rod 
    side, and the two bent lugs between which the piston rod was fitted to the 
    bolt by a steel pin, all of which has been commented above already. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Summary of Facts 
    presented on the Atlantic Lock:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) All three lugs 
    evidently failed in the forward/upward direction, which is only possible if 
    the visor hinges were broken before - see Subchapter 34.2 - Results of the 
    Finite Element Analysis of the Visor - because as long as the visor is attached 
    to all five respectively seven fixing points the force direction is aft/upwards 
    and the load on the Atlantic lock is only in the range of 50/60 ts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) The lugs failed 
    in their thinnest sections and the upper fracture surfaces of all 3 lugs look 
    more or less the same while the fracture surfaces of the lower ones look totally 
    different, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard 
      lug lower fracture runs obliquely from the upper point of the fracture towards 
      the lower forward side of the lug and the fracture surface is severely corroded.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The centre 
      lug lower fracture looks completely different because the fracture runs 
      horizontally from the point of fracture on the inside towards the outside 
      or vice versa. Also this fracture surface is severely corroded. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- according 
      to the available videos the port lug lower fracture has apparently been 
      subject to pounding. The initial condition cannot be determined anymore 
      because the lug was destroyed for testing purposes. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The upper part 
    of the starboard lug was found to be bent to starboard, while the upper parts 
    of the centre and port lugs were straight. The lower part of the starboard 
    lug was straight while the lower parts of the centre and port lugs were bent 
    to port.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) The welding 
    seams also show quite different pictures, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the starboard 
      lug and the support bracket: <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding 
      seams between the support bracket, which was much larger than the original 
      and the support bushing as well as the welding seams at the outer side of 
      the lug between the lug and the support bushing were obviously very unprofessionally 
      made repair welds when the lug was in upright position which allows the 
      conclusion that the lugs were fixed to the forepeak deck when being repair 
      welded.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welding 
      seams on the inner side between the lug and the support bushing look much 
      better but are according to the professional welders of Meyer Werft so-called 
      fill-up welds and are much thinner than the initial welds were, viz. only 
      about 3 mm whereas the initial welds were 7-8 mm - see also Subchapter 2.4.6<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the centre 
      lug has also fill-up welding seams on both sides of only about 3 mm thickness;<br>
      - the port lug could not be examined since it was destroyed for testing 
      purposes on behalf of the JAIC. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) In summary of 
    items (1) to (4) the following has to be considered established:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The visible 
      welding seams on the starboard and centre lugs and the support bracket of 
      the starboard lug were not original, thus it has to be concluded that the 
      lugs of the Atlantic lock were no more the original ones installed by Meyer 
      Werft - see also Subchapter 3.3.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The welding 
      seams in way of the outer side of the starboard lug including support bracket/support 
      bushing were poor quality repair welds made when the lug was in upright 
      condition.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The other 
      welding seams between lugs/bushing were fill-up welds of just 3 mm instead 
      of 7-8 mm in the original condition.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In particular 
      the lower fracture surface of the starboard lug showed severe corrosion 
      even though blank metal without any corrosion could be seen on the insides 
      of the lugs and on the upper part of the bolt despite these parts should 
      have become exposed to seawater at the same time as the lower fracture surface 
      of the starboard lug. This could indicate that the fracture - at least of 
      the starboard lug - existed already before the casualty.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Due to 
      the above-explained changes compared to the original condition the load-carrying 
      capacity of the complete installation had been considerably reduced.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The locking 
      bolt showed 2 areas of contact indicating that the bolt was sometimes fully 
      extended and sometimes only partly when in locked position which indicates 
      misalignment between the lugs on the vessel and/or between the lugs on the 
      vessel and the visor lug. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The steel 
      plate attached to the bolt was hammered bent from starboard to port since 
      this is the only way to move the bolt from closed to open position by means 
      of a hammer which confirms the above. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The lugs 
      between which the piston rod was fitted to the bolt were hammered apart 
      since hammering on these lugs was the most effective way to hammer the bolt 
      from open to closed position which further confirms the above.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the 
      three lugs of the Atlantic lock were deformed and misaligned to such an 
      extent that the Atlantic lock could no more be locked/unlocked by means 
      of the hydraulic actuator remotely controlled from the control panel on 
      the car deck, it had to be locked/unlocked by crew members by means of hammering. 
      See Enclosure 12.5.175.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The sensor 
      plate was empty and there are no indications that the limit switches had 
      been fitted to it at or shortly before the casualty. The inside of the drilled 
      holes show corrosion indicating that the limit switches had been dismounted 
      some time before the casualty when also the cables were cut.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The scoring 
      marks and removed paint at the upper forward side of the sensor plate do 
      originate from hammering by crew members to bend the plate further aft, 
      i.e. away from the hammering area of the bolt which is a further confirmation 
      for the above. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Since the 
      bolt - after having been recovered by the divers - was thrown back into 
      the sea by a member of the JAIC and the sensor plate - although having been 
      burnt off by the diver - was thrown away and not brought to the surface, 
      these important pieces of evidence could not be examined. </font></p>
