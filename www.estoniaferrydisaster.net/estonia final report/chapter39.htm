  <p><b><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">THE YEAR 1996 </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was the year of change 
    when this 'Group of Experts' had to realize that the JAIC was not really trying 
    to find the truth but was fighting for a particular truth as already stated 
    before. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>39.1<br>
    Communication and Investigation up to March 1996</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In January some time was 
    spent drafting the reply to Börje Stenström's letter of 22.12.95 which - finally 
    - was agreed and sent by fax of 22.01.96 to Sweden. As the contents is of 
    some importance the questions with answers shall be quoted below:<br>
    1. On top of pages 4 and 6 you say that von Tell submitted and B.V. approved 
    load calculations for the locking devices. The only document we know about 
    is the short telex from von Tell to B.V. informing that they had used LR rules 
    for defining the strength of the locking devices and were somewhat high on 
    shear stress (must presumably refer to the locking bolt). Have you seen any 
    calculations?"<br>
    as to 1:<br>
    We have seen part of the telex exchange between von Tell-Hamburg and Gothenburg 
    and also have seen some of their memos. From both it is revealed that there 
    have been discussions (probably by telephone) between BV-Hamburg and von Tell-Gothenburg, 
    and it has to be concluded that von Tell-Gothenburg have made calculations. 
    This is also confirmed by the telex you have quoted and which is in your possession. 
    To answer your question, we have not seen any of the von Tell calculations 
    as we do not know where the files from von Tell-Gothenburg are, if they should 
    still exist. We do conclude, however, from what we have read and heard from 
    von Tell-Hamburg that such calculations have been made."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">2. On page 6 you further 
    say that von Tell produced drawings sent to the yard for production. The von 
    Tell drawings showed the von Tell deliveries and the complete assembly but 
    not installation arrangements. Agree that the parts indicated by von Tell 
    as "Werft Lieferung" are not clearly identified as information or as manufacturing 
    guidance and we say in our text that this may have been misleading."<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 2: <br>
    The parts marked "Werft Lieferung" in the von Tell drawings are generally 
    according to scale respectively oversized in case they had to be made to fit 
    for installation onboard. These parts are always drawn in such a way respectively 
    the dimensions are stated in such detail that burning diagrams for the 1:10 
    shop could easily be made and/or the detail drawings were directly used for 
    production. When questioning the yard workers having done the above-mentioned 
    work in 1980 there was not the slightest indication that this "may have been 
    misleading" - as you say in your report." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">3. On bottom of page 6 you 
    say that the yard compared the von Tell design requirements with own results. 
    Again, where are von Tell design requirements given?"<br>
    "as to 3: <br>
    When we say von Tell design requirements then we mean dimensions and form 
    of the von Tell parts as could be taken from the drawings respectively from 
    the information on the drawings supplied by von Tell. In other words, the 
    yard obtained the load requirements which von Tell had based their dimensioning 
    of the locking devices on by drawing conclusion from these dimensions and 
    comparing the results with own calculations. In addition, this matter was 
    certainly also discussed on the telephone, possibly personally."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">4. Page 7, item a), refers 
    to welding tables instead of drawing information. The steel drawing for the 
    visor does indeed contain very detailed welding information for welds which 
    may be regarded as standard, such as butt joints between plates of different 
    thickness. It is lacking, however, details of the non-standard welds, such 
    as welding 60 mm thick plating. This seems to be contrary to your explanation." 
    <br>
    as to 4:<br>
    The steel drawing does contain some welding information and we agree to your 
    statement that butt joints between 2 plates of different thickness have to 
    be regarded as standard. This, however, does not refer to shape of the respective 
    steel plate edges. It is for this reason that at the lower right corner of 
    drawing 1103 very detailed dimension sketches can be found. The same refers 
    to other dimension sketches on other parts of this drawing. We assume that 
    your missing welding information is for the 60 mm plate. This can be found 
    in way of the visor arms (butt joints) as well as on the very detailed sketch 
    of the welds of the cylinder lifting lugs. In both cases, however, the measurement 
    information does not refer to the thickness of the welding seams but to the 
    preparation for the welding seams. The thickness of the welds is only indicated 
    by the thick-black coloured area. For comparison please look at the detail 
    "visor arm/bushing", where you will not find any measurement. Consequently 
    no welding preparation was required because a fillet weld was planned. The 
    black-coloured area, however, indicates a rather thick weld and reference 
    is made in this respect to page 8c, i.e. the thickness of the weld should 
    be between 50% and 70% of the thickness of the structural member to be welded. 
    Due to the very clearly and easily recognisable black-coloured area the welders 
    could not understand why they should not have followed instructions." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">5. Page 8, item (b). the 
    lugs of the bottom lock show clearly that the holes for the bushings were 
    made by machine flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges show at several places 
    a machine flame cutting pattern. (The coarse flame cutting pattern still being 
    a question-mark.)" <br>
    as to 5: <br>
    We have to assume that the lugs for the bottom locks including the holes in 
    the lugs for the bushings had been made by the 1:10 shop by means of machine 
    flame cutting. The lugs for the hinges, however, have been definitely drilled. 
    This is confirmed by the evidence of those who have done it in 1980, the respective 
    drawings, photos and, last but not least, the remains of the hinges at KTH. 
    In particular, the outer port hinge - showing only very minor burning marks 
    at one location - demonstrates the original condition of the hinges at time 
    of delivery, whilst at the stb. hinges due to the severe burning marks 10-15 
    mm material is missing. This is contrary to your previous statement when you 
    said that the initial thickness would be still there.<br>
    In summary we agree that the holes in the lugs for the bushings of the Atlantic 
    lock have probably been machine flame cut, although we have not yet found 
    the respective drawing for the 1:10 shop (probably due to the use of "Diana 
    II" drawings). As far as the holes for the hinge bushings are concerned, however, 
    we emphasize that these were drilled, which we are able to prove and have 
    done so already. We strongly suggest that you re-measure the hinge remains 
    at KTH again and you will find out that at the stb. hinges there is 10-15 
    mm material less than at the port hinges. That leads to the conclusion that 
    at the stb. hinges at least 10 mm material was missing (taken away by the 
    burning) which at port side is still there. What effect that had on the alignment 
    of the visor you may conclude yourself." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">6. Page 9, first para. We 
    have not seen any von Tell drawings giving welding information to the yard." 
    <br>
    as to 6:<br>
    The respective drawing will follow shortly." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">7. Page 11, last para. We 
    understand that Viking Sally was on the contrary a few hundred tons lighter 
    than originally estimated."<br>
    as to 7: <br>
    "Viking Sally" was not a few hundred tons lighter than originally estimated, 
    but during the building phase the steel weight was continuously controlled 
    very carefully in order to avoid overweight which would reduce the deadweight 
    figure. As a matter of fact, AB Sally commenced arbitration proceedings against 
    Meyer Werft claiming that the vessel was too heavy and thus could not carry 
    the contracted deadweight, which, however, was not found by the arbitrators.<br>
    All this has nothing to do with the welding seams which, in total, correspond 
    only to max. 2% of the steel weight. <br>
    Your assumption is probably based on the well known fact that Meyer Werft 
    vessels have proved to be heavier and stronger than ordered for decades."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> 8. Page 12, 4th para. We 
    have no documentation showing that the bottom lock was installed to meet a 
    design load of 132 tons. If available, please provide. Bottom of the same 
    page, the safety factor is not so easily defined in a design where base material 
    and welds carry the load simultaneously because the welds have some much lower 
    ductility once the yielding strength is exceeded." <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">as to 8: <br>
    The 132 ts figure is based on 7.5 mm welds and on a permissible tension of 
    150 N/mm². (7.5 mm welds were initially applied.) The safety factor considered 
    can be defined as the proportion between the nominal tension and the tension 
    of the breaking tension of the basis material."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">9. Page 13, bottom. Was the 
    extract from the von Tell drawing with the length of the side lug S70 released 
    by the yard for production? If so, based on which calculations? As far as 
    we can calculate, the strength of the side lug installation was somewhere 
    around 100 tons when subjected to the combined pulling and bending force. 
    This matches the actual tests carried out in Helsinki." <br>
    as to 9: <br>
    The lugs of the side locks were made according to von Tell drawing. The yard 
    has made sure that the length was sufficient. The relatively low LCC of the 
    side locks is not due to the too short lugs but due to the wrongly placed 
    stiffeners at the bulkheads behind the lugs."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">10. Page 15, mid. The "Copenhagen 
    Convention" you are referring to certainly does not put any obligations on 
    classification societies but contains an agreement between the Nordic countries 
    that classification societies may be authorised to perform certain functions 
    under the jurisdiction of one country and agreement that such authorization 
    will then be accepted also by the other administrations." <br>
    as to 10: <br>
    Name and application of this convention was given to us by the Finnish Board 
    of Navigation as an explanation why they did not become active in SOLAS matters 
    concerning vessel's structure."</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">11. Further observations. 
    I have looked back on ROV videos and have seen views of the bottom lock sensor 
    mounting plate where the smaller holes for the magnetic sensors are clearly 
    visible. Still no signs of the sensors themselves."<br>
    as to 11:<br>
    - We have also had more closer looks at the mounting plate in question and 
    still did not find any sign of sensors, which, according to a member of the 
    relief crew had been removed already several months before (due to damage 
    sustained during the ice-winter 1994). In our opinion it is also clear from 
    the videos that the cables for the sensors have been cut. <br>
    - The condition of the rubber packings we have discussed so many times and 
    we have nothing to add to this. <br>
    - The visor was not flooded during sea trials (there were 4 people present, 
    among them the BV surveyor Lohmann and the von Tell representative Todsen). 
    At 22 kn speed and vessel pitching in head sea near Helgoland some water was 
    leaking through the packing. After return to Emden they carried out the chalk-test 
    and found that the packing at one location was not fitting tightly enough; 
    a flat bar was welded in way, the packing fitted again, a high pressure hose 
    test was carried out, and the visor was accepted as being weathertight by 
    owners, BV, Yard and von Tell. (Signed acceptance or delivery certificate 
    has been sent to you.)"</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "Have also seen plenty of 
    rubber packing on the forepeak deck in various state of separation from the 
    flat bars. Understand the visor was flooded already during the sea trials. 
    Do you have any information about how this was corrected." <br>
    "General:<br>
    You will recall that the quantity of water at sea inside the visor respectively 
    the height of the water level has always been in dispute between us. Although 
    there are very clear water marks inside visor and outside the (closed) ramp 
    you would not accept this, which we could never understand until you gave 
    us the explanation for your attitude. Your explanation was the gap at the 
    lower port side in way of the securing bolt (which did or could not engage 
    the mating pocket at the ramp side), i.e. there was a small opening of the 
    bow ramp through which water would have penetrated the cardeck much earlier 
    already with serious consequences, which it obviously did not do and therefore 
    the water could not have been as high in the visor as we say. Upon my question 
    where do you know this from, your answer was that the gap was caused by the 
    severely twisted port outer hinges of the bow ramp, which had been stated 
    in the working list several times for repairs but had not been repaired because 
    it is a major item. We have thereafter looked a bit deeper into this and can 
    see on the videos that the hinge was under repair. We have also found the 
    explanation for water in the visor up to the visible marks, i.e. above the 
    gap, and still no water on cardeck (at least not in dangerous quantities, 
    i.e. crew members have plugged the gap each time bow ramp/visor were closed 
    when they had to go down anyway to hammer the bolt of the Atlantic lock closed 
    and at the same time plugged clothing, sheets, rags and the like into the 
    bow ramp gap. You can still see these rags, etc. hanging respectively being 
    pressed in way of the initial gap." The complete letter is attached as Enclosure 
    39.1.466 and its contents have never been disputed by the JAIC.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 8 January 58 pages of 
    the index from the Swedish JAIC's register were received and carefully studied. 
    The non-classified documents of interest, in particular the statements of 
    the survivors, were ordered and subsequently copied and sent to Hamburg by 
    members of the SEA relatives organisation. The statements and other documents 
    arrived in bunches in the course of February and March and were very carefully 
    studied, which took some time since they were in Swedish. Reference will be 
    made to this further turning point in the investigation under the respective 
    month. On the same day the Swedish JAIC plus the Sjöfartsverket observer Sten 
    Andersson met again with S.C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&T who were accompanied 
    by their lawyer. No details of the meeting are known. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">February: In an internal 
    meeting of this 'Group of Experts' it was decided to build a mock-up of the 
    Atlantic lock with as-found welding seams, i.e. 3 mm, and have it pulled to 
    destruction. The JAIC was informed accordingly and it was offered to have 
    the break test performed by VTT or any other institute in the choice of the 
    JAIC. After some time Klaus Rahka - the Finnish metallurgist expert - came 
    back on behalf of the JAIC and declared that the JAIC was happy with the "Institute 
    for Shipbuilding" (Institut für Schiffbau) of the University Hamburg to perform 
    the break test, but that the JAIC would like to attend. The preparations for 
    the tests, to which Klaus Rahka submitted own proposals, commenced and took 
    several weeks. The JAIC Report was now scheduled to be published on 15.06.96. 
    At the same time this 'Group of Experts' started the publication of a request 
    to the Swedish people in the Swedish Text-TV for photos, slides, videos and 
    other documentation/information about the condition and performance of the 
    ESTONIA during her 20 months in service under this name. The request was repeated 
    daily for 6 months and led to several slides, photos and videos, among them 
    the so-called "passenger video" of 19.09.94 which shall be commented under 
    "April" when it was received. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">March: One of the highlights 
    of the month was the publication of the book "Katastrofenkurs" (Catastrophe 
    Course) by Anders Hellberg and Anders Jörle. Hellberg was working as journalist 
    for DAGENS NYHETER and had proven on several occasions to have had confidential 
    access to the classified files of the Swedish part of the JAIC while Anders 
    Jörle was then working in the Stockholm office of "GÖTEBORG POSTEN" <br>
    The conclusion of the book written after more than one year of investigation 
    was: <br>
    The sinking of the 'Estonia' had been caused by the failure of the visor hinges 
    which were considerably pre-damaged by faulty and unqualified performed repairs. 
    The catastrophe was programmed and could have had occurred practically at 
    any time. Contributing factors were the facts that the master had not been 
    on the bridge during the decisive last 15-20 minutes and further that the 
    vessel departed from Tallinn with full port ballast water tanks but still 
    had a starboard list. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This was, more or less, a 
    confirmation of the tentative casualty scenario and cause consideration of 
    this 'Group of Experts' and in complete contradiction to the JAIC. Stenström 
    said that he would not read the book, but his colleagues had done so. </font></p>

  <p align="center"> <font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b><a name="2"></a>39.2 
    <br>
    The Break Tests and the FE Analysis of the Visor </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The first break test of a 
    mock-up of the Atlantic lock with 3-mm welds (as-found) between bushings and 
    lugs was carried out by the Institute for Shipbuilding of the University Hamburg 
    in the presence of Tuomo Karppinen and Klaus Rahka of the Finnish JAIC. <br>
    The result was the breaking of the big visor lug at a load of about 210 ts, 
    a result which was in total contradiction to the calculations and findings 
    of the JAIC and hectic phone calls between Karppinen/Rahka and Stenström followed. 
    For details of this and the break tests performed subsequently reference is 
    made to Subchapters<a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank"> 34.3 </a>and <a href="34.3-5.htm" target="_blank">34.4.</a> 
    The result of this first break test meant that the break load of an intact 
    Atlantic lock installation on the forepeak deck would have been in excess 
    of 210 ts. As the lugs on the forepeak deck failed at the accident whilst 
    the visor lug held, it follows that the lugs on the forepeak deck of ESTONIA 
    must have had a holding power inferior even to a new lock with only 3 mm welding 
    seams.<br>
    At this time the attention of the JAIC was also drawn to the results of an 
    FE analysis of the visor and the loads on its locking devices which had been 
    performed by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg - see Subchapter<a href="chapter34.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.2</a>. The result of this scientific analysis was that as long as the visor 
    hinges were intact the load on the Atlantic lock was only in the range of 
    50-60 ts. - much less than on the side locks - and that the force direction 
    was towards aft and upwards. Only after the visor hinges were broken the load 
    on the Atlantic lock almost tripled and the force direction changed towards 
    forward/upwards, i.e. the mode in which the lugs failed at the accident. All 
    this was submitted in detail and in combination with the detailed break-test 
    results to the JAIC, however without any obvious result. Upon request of the 
    JAIC three further tests were prepared, i.e. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- with a strengthened visor 
    lug to find out the break load of the 3 lugs with 3 mm welds;<br>
    - with tag welds between lugs and bushings;<br>
    - without welds between lugs and bushings; </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Klaus Rahka attended at one 
    further test and he even made written proposals - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.2.466.1.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 39.2.466.</a>1 - the others were left to the "Institute for Shipbuilding". 
    <br>
    In any event, it had been established that an intact Atlantic lock installa-tion 
    with 3-mm welds only failed at a load of 210 ts, and that the visor lug made 
    of mild steel was the weakest point. It was further established by the FE 
    analysis of the visor performed by the TU-Harburg that the load on the Atlantic 
    lock was comparatively small, less than 1/3 of the break load, and that the 
    force direction was aft/upwards as long as the visor hinges were intact. Since 
    the lugs on the forepeak deck, however, broke in a forward/upwards mode at 
    a load below 210 ts, it has to be concluded<br>
    (a) that the visor hinges were already broken when the Atlantic lock failed 
    and, further,<br>
    (b) that the Atlantic lock installation was no more intact, a fact that was 
    confirmed by the investigation of Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister. See <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    34.8.</a></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> All this in combination 
    with the side lock break-tests results by VTT, Helsinki, indicated very clearly 
    that the intact, i.e. as built, locking devices of the visor had by far not 
    been as weak as the JAIC had outlined in their Part-Report and this 'Group 
    of Experts' could correctly demand from the JAIC to correct their load assumptions 
    and conclusions. This, however, was not done in spite of all the contradictory 
    evidence, which could not be better demonstrated than by the fax that the 
    Swedish JAIC administrator Gunnel Göransson did send to the 'STERN' representative 
    in Stockholm in April 1996. It reads - office translated - as follows:<br>
    <i>"I hope you received the DN article, Anders Hellberg, who wrote the article 
    did follow up the commission work already from the beginning and did also 
    write a book which has recently been published. </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Here are the answers to 
    your questions: <br>
    1. Why does the Commission disregard the rumours concerning sabotage, dumping 
    of narcotics, the master involved with the Russian Mafia? The damage scenario 
    is so clear. The Commission has examined the visor and knows that all the 
    locking devices, Atlantic lock and side locks were properly closed when the 
    visor broke off. Therefore the rumours that the visor shall have been opened 
    early and that then the locking devices could not have been properly locked 
    again, cannot be true. Furthermore, if they would have had indeed the intention 
    to dump cargo overboard it would have been much more suitable to do it by 
    the stern ramps. <br>
    2. Did 'Estonia' comply with requirements for so-called 'short voyages'? The 
    answer is yes. The law requires that if the vessel proceeds more than 20 nm 
    from the nearest land, there has to be a radio operator onboard and there 
    has to be provision in the lifeboats (food and water). 'Estonia' had this 
    after she flew the Estonian flag and it was valid until the accident. Earlier 
    when 'Estonia' traded between Stockholm and Turku she had an exemption. <br>
    3. Cause of the casualty? <br>
    The commission maintains its opinion as stated in the technical Part-Report, 
    see page 31. a.)<br>
    The locking devices of the visor were constructed with less strength than 
    required according to calculations. Extraordinary heavy weather. The ramp 
    enclosed by the visor construction, etc. The report shall be ready later summer 
    or early autumn. Regards, Gunnel" </font></i></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Subsequently Olof Forssberg 
    was interviewed by "DER STERN" and the resulting article with the heading 
    "Unqualified Rubbish Talks" published in STERN Nr. 18/96 shall be quoted in 
    parts:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "STERN : Witnesses did reportedly 
    hear already shortly after 20.00 hours starting noises on the car deck ... 
    . What explanation does the commission have?<br>
    Forssberg : Of course all sorts of noises were heard. We have heard 135 witnesses 
    (Note: actually they heard 5), however no one heard car noises or did see 
    anything respectively. Furthermore the car deck was control-led by cameras 
    and the pictures were transferred to monitors on the bridge and in the engine 
    room .... . I do not understand that this is taken seriously in Germany.<br>
    STERN : Is it true that certain witnesses' statements have never been properly 
    followed up and that they are now classified? <br>
    Forssberg : During the pending investigation not everything is public. However, 
    when we present our Final Report all the statements will be put on the table. 
    <br>
    STERN : How did the casualty develop according to the Commission?<br>
    Forssberg : ... The combination of weather, waves and speed explains why the 
    visor was torn off. In addition, the construction of the vessel, the connection 
    between visor and bow ramp was not very fortunate, and the locks were not 
    strong enough to master the situation. <br>
    STERN : Is it true that divers were allowed to examine every-thing on the 
    sunken ferry except for the car deck? Is there something hidden? <br>
    Forssberg : In order to be able to enter the car deck difficult burning work 
    is necessary. There was no reason for this. It is irrelevant for our investigation 
    whether there were drugs or cobalt onboard. <br>
    STERN : Isn't it wrong to bury the 'Estonia' under concrete in the light of 
    these speculations before possible new evidence has been secured? <br>

    The STERN questions were answered and the interview was made well after the 
    results of the break tests in Hamburg and Helsinki were known to Forssberg. 
    <br>
    It is also amazing to note that Forssberg states that the JAIC has all information 
    they need while at the same time Stenström, Karppinen and Rahka are preparing 
    a detailed ROV inspection of the vessel and Lethola even considered another 
    wreck examination by Finnish divers. See Subchapter 39.5. </font></p>

    The Passenger Video </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 April a 90-second video 
    was received which showed the closing of the visor looking down from the open 
    deck 8. After the visor was closed the operator zoomed on the starboard visor 
    hinge for quite a while and the result was shocking. The video showed very 
    clearly and without doubt that the hinge was in an inoperable condition: The 
    outer bushing stuck out, with its lower half missing and the securing plate 
    was gone as well, just to mention a few of the very serious deficiencies demonstrated 
    by this video. The video was taken by a Swedish passenger only 10 days before 
    the last departure of the ESTONIA, i.e. on 17 September 1994. In order to 
    secure this valuable evidence properly and to obtain the most reliable information 
    from it the reconnaissance expert Bryan Roberts was instructed to evaluate 
    the video tape by means of his acknowledged methods and summarize his findings 
    in a report. For details see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    12.5</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.180.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.180</a>. Various images were made and one was sent by courier on 4 June 
    to Börje Stenström together with the explanation of what this 'Group of Experts' 
    could see on the images/tape, i.e.: <br>
    - there is a clear gap between the outer hinge plates vessel-/visor-sides 
    which was obviously created by the steel bushing not sticking far enough through 
    the bore, i.e. the larger part of the bushing is at the outer side of the 
    visor hinge plate. - the outer securing plate is missing although 3 bolts 
    can be seen.<br>
    - the lower part at the outer part of the bushing is apparently missing because 
    you can see the end of the visor arm respectively the deck where the bushing 
    respectively the securing plate should be.<br>
    - From the original of this photo, which is slightly clearer than the attached 
    copy, you can also see that the hinge plates at vessel's side are not parallel 
    to those from the visor.<br>
    - Furthermore, at the inner side there is a rust spot where subsequently the 
    upper fracture occurred. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström replied on 
    16 June as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <i>"1. Starboard side hinge. 
    Have double checked together with Mikael Huss and Hans Öberg that the free 
    ends of the hinge beam side plates are parallel, not converging as the video 
    picture shows. This may influence the virtual position of the hinge bushing. 
    Will look forward to a computer enhanced picture when available." </i><br>
    The Swedish JAIC showed the images sent to them to N&T for comments. The result 
    is unknown. <br>
    In August, during a meeting in Hamburg with the representatives of the relatives' 
    organisations DIS and SEA, Henning Witte and Lennart Berglund, the video tape 
    was shown, without mentioning the date when it was made. After his return 
    to Stockholm Witte informed the press which triggered off some interviews 
    with JAIC members and N&T on which SVENSKA DAGBLADET reported on 31 August 
    as follows: <br>
    "The video film was made by a Swedish passenger when 'Estonia' was in Tallinn 
    harbour. Meyer Werft refuses to say by whom and on which date the film was 
    made, but stated that it was "shortly before the casualty". <br>
    The film shows quite clearly, believes Meyer Werft, that the port hinges of 
    the bow visor had been manipulated. The yard's conclusion is that carrying 
    parts welded together in order that the hinges function better will lead to 
    weakening of the load carrying capacity. <br>
    Shots from the video film are known to the International Commission for more 
    than 1 month and they have received an offer to obtain a copy of the film. 
    This shall be done shortly by the Finnish Commission members, said Olof Forssberg, 
    Chairman of the Swedish part of the International Commission. He refused today 
    to comment on the degree of importance of the picture material as evidence. 
    This will, however, be determined before the substantially delayed Final Report 
    will be published. .......... <br>
    On behalf of the owners N&T the technical manager, Sten-Christer Forsberg, 
    rejected the last play-out of the German yard." <br>
    "This is nothing new or changed, not everything is as obvious as it seems. 
    We have seen the shots from the video which the yard has sent to the Commission 
    and we have replied that these pictures do not prove what the Germans are 
    alleging", said S.C. Forsberg.<br>
    "The pictures are data enlargements and are of the same fantastic quality 
    as the Germans are talking about their own behaviour. We base ourselves only 
    on our own material which confirms that the vessel was 'in good condition' 
    before the casualty", said S.C. Forsberg. <br>
    He also rejected the conclusion of Meyer Werft viz. that there should be no 
    welding at load carrying parts in order to make the hinges of the visor function 
    better. <br>
    "There have been no welding works at the visor hinges. This is furthermore 
    another one in a line of allegations put forward by the Germans. Earlier they 
    had already alleged that the bow visor was opened when the vessel was in Stockholm. 
    But the visor is mainly not opened when the vessel is in Stockholm", said 
    S.C. Forsberg, who characterised the acting of the German yard as "unethical".<br>
    The remarks of the N&T manager shall not be commented, however, the attention 
    of the reader is drawn to the picture on page 292 of this report which shows 
    the ESTONIA at her berth in Stockholm with open visor and open bow ramp.<br>
    On 5 September a copy of the video tape together with the Bryan Roberts report 
    was handed over to the Finnish part of the JAIC in Helsinki. It was viewed 
    jointly with Kari Lethola, Tuomo Karppinen, Klaus Rahka and Kari Larjo and 
    everybody realised and recognised the deficiencies as explained in the report 
    of Bryan Roberts. Subsequently the tape was sent to the Criminal Police Laboratory 
    for examination whether it had been falsified, which it was not. Thereafter 
    a copy was sent to Olof Forssberg of the Swedish JAIC, who informed prosecutor 
    Tomas Lindstrand about the video.<br>
    By letter of 13 September, however, Forssberg sent the tape to the Military 
    Intelligence Service (MUST) - see Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.467.htm" target="_blank">39.3.467 
    </a>- and asked for data processing and contour strengthenings of certain 
    sequences. <br>
    The MUST reply came on 20 September and is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/39.3.468.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    39.3.468. </a><br>
    The "comments on the picture sequence" by MUST reads as follows: <br>
    "Mikael Huss mentioned a 'white line' at the bottom of the visor arm and the 
    right part of the hinge. Upon studying the sequences picture by picture it 
    is visible that this line is connected and sometimes looks broken. We have 
    made 2 examples from each part picture which show these variations. <br>
    Such effect might occur with pictures if the distance between 2 objects is 
    just few frames. Sometimes the objects are melting together and sometimes 
    there appears to be a gap between them. This is due to the digital sensor 
    of the video camera, respectively, how this sensor meets the shadow in each 
    single picture." <br>
    The result is not negative and it is nowhere mentioned that the video tape 
    is not reliable and cannot be interpreted correctly.<br>
    Nevertheless Stenström wrote on 20 September to this 'Group of Experts':<br>
    <i>"Regarding the tourist video picture, we have of course studied the report 
    of Dr. Robert with great interest. Unfortunately it does not come out from 
    his report whether the analysis is based on a computer enhanced picture or 
    purely from work with isolated pictures. Was a computer treated picture ever 
    produced? We have looked at the video tape handed over to our Finnish colleagues 
    two weeks ago and have done so on a screen where the pictures could be fed 
    one by one with retained clarity. In this mode most of the details in the 
    hinge area jump around quite a bit and the starboard hinge bushing is twisted 
    clockwise almost as often as it is twisted anti-clockwise. We are attempting 
    to get a computer processed picture from the copy we have and will study further 
    the possibility of a pre-accident damage to the hinge arrangement."</i> <br>
    On 28 September DAGENS NYHETER published under the heading "The Hinges of 
    the Visor Were Sound" the comment of Olof Forssberg: "The pictures which allegedly 
    show that the visor hinges were maltreated show instead that the hinges were 
    'completely sound'." <br>

    Enclosure 39.3.469</a>.<br>
    On 21 October Anders Hellberg wrote in DAGENS NYHETER under the heading "Video 
    Film Causes Controversies" and quoted the following comments: <br>
    "Olof Forssberg: <i>"We do not believe that the pictures show anything new, 
    none of them reveal that there was such a damage as alleged by the relatives."</i><br>
    Hellberg went on to say: <i>"Börje Stenström pointed out that the loads during 
    the casualty night affected the port and not the starboard hinges as the yard 
    is now alleging."</i><br>
    Finally he quoted Sten-Christer Forsberg, the technical manager of N&T, who 
    could find nothing serious in the report of the English expert: <br>
    <i>"As far as I understand the judgements of the Swedish defence and the JAIC 
    destroy the basis for the theory of the German yard." </i><br>

    Enclosure 39.3.470</a>. <br>
    Börje Stenström wrote on 3 November to this 'Group of Experts':<br>
    <i>"Have arranged for a copy of the data processed picture of the deck hinge 
    to be sent to you. This picture is produced by superimposing in a computer 
    program all the still pictures during a time period. In the 'average' picture 
    so obtained the distorsions, which are numerous in any one still picture from 
    a video camera, will be eliminated.<br>
    I am still not certain whether Dr. Robert has used such technique or not in 
    his work. In this cleaned up picture we cannot see any signs of the distorsions 
    that Dr. Roberts is reporting about. <br>
    Am trying to look into the listing of discrepancies you made in the fax but 
    have very little evidence to by. Likewise we have no evidence of any contact 
    accident with a berth of breakwater, certainly nothing that has been reported 
    to the class."</i><br>
    The picture received showed the same as all the other images and the tape 
    itself. It was nevertheless sent to Bryan Roberts for comments, which read 
    as follows:<br>
    <i>"Thank you for your letter of the 12 November and the enclosed print 0:05:17. 
    This is within the bracket of frames I used in my Report. The complete range 
    showing the starboard hinge assembly being 0:05:13 to 0:05:40. These were 
    all used to arrive at the conclusions in my Report. <br>
    The frame 0:05:17 is one of this sequence and, with frame by frame re-examination 
    I can see no reason to change the content of my Report in any way. The change 
    of angle between the visor bolt (annotation 10) and the outer bushing (annotation 
    8) can be clearly seen on images in this sequence and equally well on frame 
    0:05:17, although the quality of the images I used were rather better than 
    this print. <br>
    In assembling my Report I examined all frames on the video tape with any possible 
    relevance to damage or distortion. These were viewed frame by frame on a Sony 
    UP5200 printer/projector which allows visual examination of each frame and 
    printout of selected frames at a chosen degree of enlargement. The ability 
    to scan a sequence allows the comparison of one frame to another and any difference 
    between components of an assembly to be seen." </i><br>
    Bryan Roberts' reply was sent to Stenström by fax of 15 November together 
    with the following remarks:<br>
    <i>"Since you have given your photo together with the report of Bryan Roberts 
    obviously to the press - where else should they have got it from - and bearing 
    in mind your and Olof Forssberg's remarks to Dagens Nyheter published on 21.10.96 
    (copy attached), we will now also give the comments of Bryan Roberts to Anders 
    Hellberg and others." </i><br>
    Stenström's reply came two days later on 17 November: <br>
    <i>"To clarify matters, the picture of the starboard hinge first appeared 
    on Swedish TV in an interview with the lawyer Witte, obviously after he had 
    had a meeting with you. Media naturally demanded comments from the commission 
    and only then did we make our opinion public.<br>
    As to the technicalities, we have also looked at the pictures one by one and, 
    as I have said before, there is considerable jumping around of the contours 
    of the details. The average picture obtained by superimposing all pictures 
    via a computer program then shows the correct shape, better than any isolated 
    picture. Taking the contour of the bottom of the hinge beam as an example, 
    the "mean picture" shows that it stops short of the hinge bolt locking plate. 
    Many of the individual frames show the same thing. To comment only from an 
    individual frame showing the opposite obviously becomes dubious. <br>
    We are at the moment not exploring this matter further." </i><br>
    In other words, the JAIC would completely disregard the evidence contained 
    in this video and that's what they did. It was not mentioned at all in their 
    Final Report. Hellberg, however, wrote again on 25 November, obviously after 
    having spoken to Bryan Roberts: <br>
    "Hinges of 'Estonia' Were Damaged.<br>
    Dispute about video film, British photo expert rejects casualty investigation. 
    By Anders Hellberg <br>
    The 'Estonia' Commission does not believe in the information that the starboard 
    hinge was dangerously damaged when 'Estonia' left Tallinn on the evening of 
    the 27th September 1994. <br>
    In case the Commission had taken another attitude a large part of the blame 
    for the catastrophe would be with N&T, having been respon-sible for the operation 
    of the vessel, and with the classification society Bureau Veritas, who performed 
    the inspections. <br>
    The members and experts of the Commission, however, do not believe that it 
    is possible to draw the same conclusions from the video, taken on board of 
    'Estonia' weeks before the catastrophe, as the English photo analysis expert 
    did.<br>
    <i>- "This is pure nonsense", said one of the members to DN during the meeting 
    the Commission had in Stockholm last week. <br>
    - "The total arm holding the visor is winding like a snake in the film due 
    to unevenness of the video - it is not possible to draw conclusions from such 
    material", said one of the experts. <br>
    - "We do not trust the interpretation of the British photo expert who has 
    been instructed by the German yard",</i> said another member. <br>
    According to the Yard and the British photo interpretation expert Bryan Roberts 
    the bolt, which holds the starboard hinge, is not there and the bushing through 
    which the bolt should go is partly missing. Thereby the whole hinge should 
    have been so dangerously weak-ened that it collapsed in the heavy weather 
    and was also the cause for the visor to fall off. The Swedish experts of the 
    intelligence Service, MUST, state in their short report that there are variations 
    between different pictures of the film and that this should explain, among 
    other things, why the bushing towards the bolt appears to be broken. <br>
    Bryan Roberts said he was astonished by such an attitude: <br>
    <i>"It is obvious that on a number of picture details of the deck can be seen 
    which should not be possible to be seen"</i> - this is a fact which is difficult 
    to get around. There can be no doubt that the bolt of the hinge is missing.<br>
    Roberts, who has long years of experience as a photo interpreter inside the 
    British Military Intelligence Service, said he had used a number of pictures 
    in video sequences and that his expert opinion therefore was not just based 
    on one frame. <br>
    Although the angle to the bushing was changed, it could be seen on a large 
    number of frames on the video. "I cannot understand", said Roberts, <i>"how 
    other experts can come to a conclusion other than mine. I would be pleased 
    to meet them to discuss the matter." </i><br>
    But the Commission consequently cannot trust Roberts without changing their 
    initial opinion stated in the Part-Report from 1st April 1995, viz. that at 
    first the locking devices failed before the hinges broke. According to the 
    opinion of the yard, at first the hinges collapsed due to having been weakened 
    before the locking devices at the bottom of the visor broke." <br>
    Thereafter the video film was not mentioned again in the Swedish media but 
    was brought back to the attention of the public by the Exhibitions held by 
    this 'Group of Experts' in Stockholm in June and December 1997. See Subchapters 
    40.2 / 40.3. </font></p>
