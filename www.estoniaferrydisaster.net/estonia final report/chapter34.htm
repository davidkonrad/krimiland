  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the course of 
    the year 1995 and subsequently this 'Group of Experts' initiated a number 
    of technical and scientific investigations to ascertain the load exposure 
    of the visor and its locking devices, the actual strength of the Atlantic 
    Lock and the condition of parts recovered from wreck and visor. Also the break 
    load of the bow ramp hinges and the forces necessary for the visor lugs to 
    cut through the deck beam at frame 159 were calculated. In addition the available 
    video footage was evaluated and analysed and the videos still showing unexplainable 
    damage to the wreck were examined by a diving and explosive expert. Furthermore 
    the investigation results of "The Independent Fact Group", Stockholm, concerning 
    the forgery of documents to hide the initial unseaworthi-ness of the ESTONIA 
    have been taken up into this chapter with the permission of the authors. Finally, 
    the results of an investigation by the Det Norske Veritas Classification A/S 
    Håvik/Norway concerning the design load aspects for the bow area of Ro-Ro 
    vessels under the heading<b><i> "Bow Impact of Ro-Ro Vessels"</i></b> have 
    been made available and shall be considered in this chapter as well. <br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This group consists 
    of Björn Stenberg, Johan Ridderstolpe and a number of unknown members, preferring 
    to stay in the background. It was founded in the beginning of 1999 to clarify, 
    in a well structured and methodical way, the many open questions and speculations 
    in connection with the ESTONIA catastrophe, the work of the JAIC and behaviour 
    of the Government.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is the purpose 
    to enable the political decision makers on basis of facts to reconsider the 
    matter and, finally, agree on a new investigation.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The first work 
    of the IFG concerns the very carefully performed analyses of different documents 
    found in the archives of the JAIC and Shipinspec in Stockholm. These documents 
    relate to the inspection of the ESTONIA until about 2 hours before her last 
    departure by The Swedish inspectors Åke Sjöblom and Gunnar Zahlée from the 
    Shipinspec Malmö office. The inspection was meant to be a Port State Control 
    (PSC) to train 8 or 9 high ranking Estonian officials. - See Chapter 15. At 
    the end the normal PSC form used by Shipinspec inspectors in Swedish ports 
    was filled out and the "findings" entered. Both form and findings do exist 
    in at least 4, probably 5, different versions, all of which are discussed 
    and evaluated by the IFG, the apparent purpose being to hide in hindsight 
    the initial unseaworthiness of the ESTONIA upon departure from Tallinn which 
    would clearly have been established if the complete findings would have been 
    entered into the form as required. <br>

    Structural Analysis of Bow Visor and Locking Devices<br>
    by means of the Finite Element Analysis by the Technical University Hamburg-Harburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As part of the investigation 
    in connection with the sinking of the ferry ESTONIA the structure of the visor 
    has been calculated on the basis of the load requirements by the Classification 
    Society Bureau Veritas (B.V.) by means of the Finite Element Method. Thereby 
    the distribution of the reaction forces on the fixing points of the visor, 
    and especially on the Atlantic lock, were of particular interest because of 
    the allegations published by the JAIC that the casualty had been initiated 
    by the failure of the locking devices of the visor. For this reason detailed 
    calculations have been performed, including cases whereby only a limited attachment 
    still existed after the hinges had failed. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time 
    of the design and construction of the vessel in 1979/1980 such detailed calculations 
    were neither required by the Classification Societies nor were they state-of-the-art. 
    The selected load on the model is based on an analysis of B.V. whereby the 
    load, acting normally on the shell plating of the visor was assumed to be 
    the water pressure acting on the visor when the ferry was underway. The load 
    acting on the lowest part of the visor was assumed to be 7 t/m² and decreasing 
    continuously with increasing height. At no height level is the pressure less 
    than 3.5 t/m². The load includes the C-deck (forecastle deck). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The weight 
    of the empty visor and the rubber packings on the forepeak deck have been 
    taken into account in all calculations. Wave loads have been assumed to act 
    only on the port side of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Before discussing 
    the results, the symbols for the directions into which the forces were acting 
    shall be explained:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> x = transverse 
      (athwartship)<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">y = longitudinal 
      (forward aft)<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">z = vertical 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The calculations 
    clearly reveal that as long as the hinges are intact the Atlantic lock takes 
    only very little load. The force direction is opposite to the direction into 
    which the vessel is proceeding, i.e. aft. The small load is to be attributed 
    to the low stiffeners and the high deformation of the visor bottom. Even by 
    using a more detailed net of finite elements no other tendencies became apparent 
    respectively no other results were achieved. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In normal cases 
    the highest loads appear in way of the side locks. The loads cause the aft 
    bulkheads of the visor to be pressed against the front bulkheads of the vessel 
    in the middle and upper areas.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case also 
    the rubber packing of the visor on the vessel's front bulkheads are taken 
    into account the vertically acting loads are reduced.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If a load is 
    acting on the visor only from one side the hinge on this side has to bear 
    excessive load while the load on the other is less than normal, however, partly 
    acting from different directions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case the 
    visor is under constant pressure the loads on the hinges and side locks do 
    increase while the load on the Atlantic lock is decreasing. In case one or 
    both hinges fail all other fixing points have to bear substantially more load 
    and the force direction on the Atlantic lock changes to the opposite direction, 
    i.e. to forward. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case one 
    hinge fails the Atlantic lock has to bear 2.6 times of the normal load, if 
    both hinges fail the Atlantic lock has to bear 15.8 times of the normal load. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results 
    of this structural analysis of the visor can be summarised as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By means of several 
    calculation models various load conditions have been simulated, for example 
    the pressure load according to B.V., the load from the side and the load due 
    to a permanent pressure load. In all cases the visor's own weight was taken 
    into account.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The different 
    fixing point conditions were simulated as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - visor fixed 
      to hinges and locking devices,<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally 
      the rubber packings were considered,<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- additionally 
      considering the manual side locks, <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- failure 
      of one and both hinges. The analysis reveals that the Atlantic lock absorbs 
      only a small force component as long as the hinges are intact. The force 
      direction is aft.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The highest forces 
    on the fixing points are effective when the load is acting simultaneously 
    on both side locks. If the visor is exposed to a load only on one side, the 
    load on the hinges on this side is the biggest.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In case that 
    one or both hinges fail, the Atlantic lock becomes exposed to very heavy loads 
    and the force direction changes by 180° to forward.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">If both hinges 
    fail the Atlantic lock has to take the heaviest load. The complete Report 
    is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.2.430.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.2.430. </a></font></p>
