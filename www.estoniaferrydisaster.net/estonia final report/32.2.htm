  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Behind the front 
    bulkhead there is an upper and a lower void space located. In the upper one 
    - actually the B-deck - the visor actuator and the ramp hook arrangement was 
    fitted. The part of the bow ramp with the mating lug for the ramp hook was 
    extending into the void space as can be seen on the picture below. The arrow 
    points to the ramp hook.</font></p>

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The upper void 
    space behind the starboard front bulkhead shows considerable damage to the 
    bulkhead plating with the plating bent from inside to outside and frequently 
    cracked. This had obviously been possible because the upper part of the visor 
    moved forward after the starboard hinges and side lock had failed and never 
    contacted the front bulkhead again, because at the lower end of the blown 
    open plating a big steel part is extending almost horizontally which otherwise 
    would have been pressed back. The same refers to the steel tongue extending 
    from the visor plating in way which was also not pressed against the bulkhead.

    The lower void space behind the starboard front bulkhead shows very considerable 
    damage in way of the openings for the lug and hooks of the hydraulic and manual 
    side locks but, in particular, further down the bulkhead was apparently completely 
    cracked off the forepeak deck and pushed upwards. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The front bulkhead 
    plating below the area of the hydraulic side lock was pushed outwards with 
    excep-tion of the rubber packing - see image below. It is clearly visible 
    that the rubber packings, normally extending beyond the</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    bulkhead, are in some sort of fold indicating that the surrounding plating 
    was deformed towards the outside</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">.</font></p>

    shows the area further down the bulkhead. Arrow 1 points to the lower edge 
    of the opening for the hook, arrow 2 to the rubber packing and arrow 3 to 
    the deep, sharp fold to starboard of the rubber packing, which extends from 
    forepeak deck level up to the side becoming narrower the further up it runs. 
    It is obvious that the surrounding bulkhead plating was deformed towards the 
    outside of both sides of this fold and also between the rubber packing and 
    the inner bulkhead edge.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Further down the 
    front bulkhead in the so-called "corner of the mouth", the area to the outside 
    of the rubber packing is cracked open over some 300 mm - see left image below. 
    The bottom part of the front bulkhead is severely deformed and apparently 
    cracked off the forepeak deck as well as cracked off the inner bulkhead plating 
    and probably also off the outer shell plating as can be seen from the left 
    image below.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In explanation of 
    the left image the following has to be noted:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>arrow 1</b> 
      = change over from blue to white paint. On the image below the arrow points 
      to the respective area on the opposite port side. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>arrow 
      2</b> = points to the torn off and dislocated lower parts of the front bulkhead. 
      The right image shows the corresponding intact port side.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As 
    the visor was resting against this area when a possible explosion occurred, 
    the bulkhead could not burst open to forward and the pressure obviously escaped 
    downwards and to the sides. Thereby the complete lower part of the front bulkhead 
    was torn off the recess on the inside, off the shell plating on the outside 
    and off the fore-peak deck on the lower side. Actually the area indicated 
    by arrow 2 should be blue as can be seen from the image beside it showing 
    the respective port side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Next to the cracked 
    open inner bulkhead plating, the lower section of the starboard outer vertical 
    girder of the bow ramp - being immediately next to the cracked plating when 
    the ramp is closed. It is noted to be cracked off both from the upper and 
    the lower transverse girder as well as from the bow ramp plating and extremely 
    deformed and pushed to port. - See the image below with the explanatory drawing 
    and also the extensive photo documentation in Subchapter 29.2.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Slightly further 
    up, the landing of the fastening of the starboard bow ramp actuator was noted 
    to have been cracked open, severely deformed, with the fastenings of the actuator 
    missing and the actuator broken twice. See the following image. </font></p>

    had been attached.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the extent 
    of this damage it has to be assumed that additional areas were affected, e.g. 
    the bottom part of this and the adjacent void spaces, and the bulkhead towards 
    the car deck. The appearance of the corresponding parts of the starboard lower 
    aft bulkhead of the visor do confirm that the damage existing in way of the 
    lower starboard front bulkhead of the vessel and the adjacent area was most 
    probably caused by the same occurrence, viz.:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The two pictures 
    below were taken from page 168 of the JAIC Report. The left picture shows 
    the port aft bulkhead of the visor and the right one the starboard one, both 
    in way of the initial location of the lugs for the hydraulic side locks. See 
    also Chapter 30.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is most likely 
    that the starboard side had been exposed to considerable heat which is indicated 
    by the corroded surface as a result of the changed metal structure. It is 
    also most likely that the starboard side had been exposed to pressure from 
    inside to outside which is indicated by the distortions and the cracked off 
    stiffener, indicating a possible explosion in way. - See also Subchapter 37.7.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As more damage had 
    to be expected to the bulkheads surrounding the forward void space on starboard 
    side between A-deck (car deck) and B-deck, the available video footage was 
    again analysed and the following was found: While the diver walked up (down) 
    the starboard inside of the bow ramp and adjacent bulkhead plating from the 
    opening at forecastle deck level to the hinges respectively lower flaps of 
    the bow ramp, then along the flaps to the port side and up the port side of 
    the ramp to the port opening, he was instructed only to look for the securing 
    bolts and mating boxes of the bow ramp and that was exactly what he did, thereby 
    ignoring completely most relevant damage areas. Unfortunately the quality 
    of the footage is very poor and thus the images are rather foggy. Nevertheless 
    the important findings should be understandable to the reader the following 
    explanations:</font></p>
  <p>T<font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">he image on below 
    shows the area of the recess bulkhead between the lug for the preventer wire 
    and the upper mating box. Arrow 1 points to the rubber packing of the bow 
    ramp and arrow 2 points to the edge of the bow ramp. Between the arrows a 
    metal flap is visible which is apparently part of the recess. Transferred 
    to the front bulkhead around the corner this is the area of the big damage 
    above the lug of the hydraulic lock. See also the above drawing.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next image shows 
    the black/yellow painted tire-protection bar edge of the bow ramp to the right 
    with the remains, i.e. the inner part of the fastening, for the starboard 
    ramp actuator - see arrow 1.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is further visible 
    that the edge of the ramp is bent up - arrow 2 - above the line of the recess 
    bulkhead - see red dotted line.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The next image shows 
    the crushed lower mating box which was ignored by the diver. See arrow. This

    wooden planks sticking out of the torn up bulkhead edge - arrow 1 - and something

    turned his head abruptly to the right and headed for the port lower mating 
    box and the securing bolt where he spent some 10-15 minutes. <b>The large 
    and spectacular damage explained above of an area which could not have been 
    damaged in the course of the "heavy weather casualty scenario" was not examined 
    by the divers, at least not on the publicly available video footage.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The drawing below 
    is a part of the general arrangement plan of the vessel which shows the forward 
    part of A-deck = car deck and the area directly below on tween deck = 1st 
    deck. The red hatched area shows the damage area which can be seen on the 
    images explained on the previous pages. The distance from the bow ramp - arrow 
    1 - to the corner of the bulkhead - arrow 2 - is about 4 m. Below the dotted 
    line the bow thruster space begins, before that space the full forepeak was 
    located.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although it has to 
    be assumed that also the fastening of the port ramp actuator was blown off 
    when the ramp was in slightly open or closed condition, this cannot be documented

    ramp - see also Subchapter 29.2 - is damaged in various places to such an 
    extent that it cannot easily be explained, for example:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The area in way 
    of the 2nd transverse girder from the top (2nd girder below the upper flaps),

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This very severe 
    damage cannot have been caused by contact with any part of the vessel as long

    This 'Group of Experts' emphasizes that the video images and the other evidence 
    discussed in the foregoing are evidently based on the material in the possession 
    of the JAIC. However, the JAIC has nowhere in its report in any way commented 
    on this most disturbing evidence, including the presence of severe structural 
    damages to the hull.</font></p>
