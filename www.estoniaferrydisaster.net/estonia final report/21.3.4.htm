<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Only in the forward 
    third of this deck there were passenger cabins, the luxury cabins equipped 
    with mobile phones. In the larger part, there were the A-la-carte Restaurants 
    SeaSide and Poseidon, the Baltic Bar and the Casino. Also this area had been 
    changed considerably in comparison to the newbuilding layout. The above drawing 
    shows the latest condition. Before referring to the testimony of passengers 
    and crew members having been on this deck, the summary of the statement of 
    Mats Hillerström shall be outlined. He was actually sharing cabin 1026 below 
    car deck with 3 others but felt unwell and scared and thus moved up to the 
    aft and open part of deck 6 already after midnight, ship's time, ca. 00.30 
    hours! See also Chapter 20. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">With reference to 
    the photo on the next page here are his observations in short:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»He 
      stayed in a sheltered place on starboard side best protected against the 
      storm and heard nothing but the noises of the storm. The air was full of 
      spray. At some time he saw a large vessel on starboard side apparently on 
      same course and speed. Also on starboard side, but far away and astern, 
      there was another vessel which was slower because the distance appeared 
      to increase. He looked at his watch and it was 01.05 hours. Suddenly and 
      without any previous indication the vessel heeled to starboard. He saw the 
      tables and chairs inside the restaurant moving to starboard. Within a very 
      short time the vessel took such a list that he could not walk anymore on 
      the deck, but had to pull himself along the railing on the aft part to the 
      higher port side.</i></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>When he had 
      reached the port side, he looked over the side and got the impression that 
      the vessel had reduced speed and was turning to port.</i></font></p>

        to make the suitcase slide down from the sofa. He has further ascertained 
        that it took him a maximum of 5 minutes, probably less, to reach the inside 
        of the 7th deck where he met Silver Linde and the other two crew members. 
        This means that Silver Linde had never been at the Information desk on 
        deck 5 when the big heel occurred and also never went down to deck 4 thereafter.</font></p>

    the performance of the dance group from Pörnu was ended due to violent movements

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of items 
    a.) - e.) the following can be concluded:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) The noise 
      scenario was partly different, partly more or less the same as heard on 
      the lower decks which can probably be explained by the longer distance from 
      deck 6 to the casualty areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The observations 
      stated under (1) and (2) were made by passengers Mats Hillerström and Christer 
      Eklöf. Hillerström was out on deck in the aft part of deck 6, starboard, 
      when the big heel occurred. He saw the vessel still turning to port when 
      he looked over the port side which was confirmed by Christer Ecklöf when 
      he reached the outside of deck 7 only two or three minutes after the heel. 
      It was not confirmed by Per-Erik Ehrnsten who reached the open deck 7 probably 
      four to five minute after the heel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) The time for 
      the big heel was about 01.00 hours as confirmed by most of the survivors 
      who have stated this time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(d) As on the other 
      decks the righting up after the big heel has been reported by only few survivors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (e) Vessel was 
      at 01.31 hours on her side. </font></p>
