      <b>Kadak</b>: motorman, 11/2 years at sea, first shift on 'Estonia', was 
      on board 10 days <br>
      1. Q: Do you know how the visor functioned?<br>
      A: Very little, not my job. <br>
      2. Q: Was it dark when you left 'Estonia'?<br>
      A: Some light in the distance. Was swimming. Saw 'Estonia's' silhouette. 
      Frightening. Heavy list. Saved himself before the capsizing. <br>
      3. Q: Was the visor in place? <br>
      A: Possibly, but not fully certain. The stern sank first. The vessel turned 
      when the stern sank down. Much shouting. Completely dark.<br>
      4. Q: Did you see the bulbous bow above water!<br>
      A: Cannot answer this (was close to being squeezed to death when rescued 
      by 'Silja Europa').<br>
      5. Q: <b>Did you see a black hole? </b><br>
      A: Impossible to see.<br>
      6. Q: Have you been on watch?<br>
      A: Yes, I was in the engine control room. Did not see anything unusual. 
      <br>
      7. Q: How did the vessel behave? <br>
      A: It was very stormy. Heavy movements. Heavy vibrations. No abnormal noises. 
      Was in the control room when the engines stopped. Heel was then about 50°. 
      Everything rushed to the side. <br>
      8. Q: How did you get out?<br>
      A: Via the engine room and up through the emergency exit in the funnel. 
      <br>
      9. Q: Which building no. did you have?<br>
      A: Don't know. <br>
      10. Q: Did you go o full speed?<br>
      A: I am certain. Not my job.<br>
      11. Q: Did you look to the monitor?<br>
      A: Yes, I saw water on the monitor. I don't know when it started to penetrate. 
      The height of the water was above the roofs of the personal cars. <br>
      12. Q: <b>Did you see whether the hatch burst open by explosion (was blown 
      open)? </b><br>
      A: Don't know. Was in control room and asked: Shall we leave? Went out through 
      the watertight door. Did not close the door because certain personnel stayed 
      behind. <br>
      13. Q: Why did you leave? Heel or water on car deck?<br>
      A: General feeling that something did happen. The emergency generator started 
      when they pulled themselves up. 15-20 seconds after they came out everything 
      became dark. Injured his hands at a hot boiler in the engine room when it 
      was dark. <br>
      14. Q: How long did it take from everything normal until leaving the vessel? 
      <br>
      A: Ca. 30 minutes. From the bridge came as long as Kadak was in the engine 
      control room: Can you correct the list? Are the engines OK?" </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">These question/answer notes 
    were also published in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 06.10.94, however, without the 
    question whether the bow ramp was blown open by an explosion. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much to the surprise of the Finnish and Swedish members 
    the interrogations were suddenly interrupted by Andi Meister at this time, 
    allegedly because their plane would be waiting, which was a poor excuse as 
    the plane - owned by the Estonian Coast Guard - would have waited as long 
    as required. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manner which Andi Meister chose to end 
    the first meeting of the JAIC caused considerable irritation with the Swedish 
    and Finnish members. <br>
    This was reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET on the next day - 30.09.94 - as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"<b>Political manipulations 
      disturb casualty investigation. Estonian Minister blamed for forcing important 
      questioning of survivors</b>.<br>
      The Estonian chairman of the JAIC, Transport Minister Andi Meister, is committing 
      political manipulations which have already done damage to the work of the 
      JAIC. <br>
      Due to the pressure resulting from forthcoming elections in Estonia he forced 
      the first questioning of surviving crew members in Turku. "Therewith Meister, 
      having absolutely no experience with casualty investigation, has already 
      proved that he is unsuitable to lead the work", a source said. <br>
      Both the Swedish and the Finnish members of the JAIC are irritated about 
      the Estonian chairman's stopping the first interrogations held in Turku 
      on Wednesday. The JAIC had selected 3 crew members who were considered to 
      be the most interesting to be questioned: <br>
      - AB sailor Silver Linde, who went the last watch-round, just an hour before 
      the casualty, and who subsequently received instructions from the vessel's 
      command to go down to the car deck to find out what was happening there, 
      just before the vessel took the heavy list and sank. <br>
      - Engineer Henrik Sillaste who saw on the TV monitor in the engine room 
      that water was streaming onto the deck. <br>
      - the third witness was a motorman.<br>
      Interrogating the three has revealed valuable information. For the JAIC 
      it was very important to hear their reports and to put forward their questions 
      without haste and pressure. Therefore the behaviour of the Estonian Transport 
      Minister "is, at least, strange", said one of the Swedish participants. 
      "He made it understood, powerfully and determinedly, that the interrogation 
      should be stopped so that he could go back on the plane waiting at the airport 
      of Turku." The plane had been chartered by the Foreign Ministry to take 
      survivors home to Tallinn. "We carried out the questioning as well as possible. 
      Finally we understood that we were compelled to end the interrogation - 
      the plane was waiting", said one of the investigators. Various different 
      sources have confirmed the picture. <b>In addition, the Transport Minister 
      had made it quite clear that he wished a quick investigation.</b> "He believes 
      in his naiveté that the investigation can be finalised within two weeks". 
      It was apparently the intention of the Minister to present the investigation 
      report on the 'Estonia' casualty before the change of government in Estonia 
      which was forthcoming. Upon the question of the Transport Minister Meister 
      to Olof Forssberg, head of the three-man Swedish part of the JAIC, as to 
      how long it would take until the investigation is completed, Forssberg replied: 
      "About 1 year." "This answer left him considerably surprised", said one 
      source. "No perspective, no experience. He obviously has never had anything 
      to do with qualified casualty investigations", said another participant 
      at the Turku meeting."<br>
      <b>Note: </b>When being interviewed by Jutta Rabe, Andi Meister said among 
      other things: "I thought it was not the best decision to appoint me as chairman 
      because of my position." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Also the following statements 
    were made to DAGENS NYHETER and published on 29.09.94:<br>
    Kari Lethola refused to make a statement as to the possible cause of the casualty, 
    but said: <i>"However, since there is a bulkhead between the port and starboard 
    side of the car deck, shifting of cargo can be excluded ..... " </i><br>
    <b>Note:</b> He means the centre casing.<br>
    Also Carl Bildt did not wish to speculate on the causes, but stated that <i>"it 
    could not just have been the heavy weather"</i>. He added that during the 
    forthcoming investigation work<i> " ...... each stone will be turned"</i>.

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">&quot;<b>One master survived</b><br>
      There were two masters onboard the 'Estonia'. The acting master was Arvo 
      Andresson who did not survive. <br>
      Piht was onboard to fulfil his examination to obtain the pilot licence for 
      the Stockholm archipelago. "The 4 inspections carried out by the Swedish 
      Sjöfartsinspektionen did not include the condition of visor and bow ramp. 
      This had to be done by the French classification society Bureau Veritas." 
      <br>
      "Henrik Sillaste, 25 years old, was working in the engine room when he saw 
      on the TV monitor that water was penetrating the bow ramp." "We had 'Estonia' 
      on the radar screen for exactly 8 minutes. Then she was lying stopped in 
      the water. At 01.48 hours (Finnish time) she disappeared from the radar 
      and we knew what that meant", said the Staff Commander of the Fortress Utö."

  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In the evening the Swedish 
    Embassy in Moscow sent by fax an ITAR-TASS message from St. Petersburg with 
    the following wording: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><i>"St. Petersburg September 
      29 TAS - by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev. Rumyantsev: A Russian underwater 
      expert believes people may still be alive inside the 'Estonia' ferry which 
      capsized in the Baltic Sea on Wednesday and lies at a depth of 80-90 metres.<br>
      "Hundreds of people remaining inside the sunken ferry can be saved and should 
      be saved." Anatoly Kuteinikov, designer general of the St. Petersburg based 
      'Malakhit' company told TASS on Thursday. The company is the leading Russian 
      defence enterprise producing underwater craft. <br>
      He said that an "air cushion" always accompanies any shipwreck and may allow 
      those remaining inside the ferry to stay alive for at least a week.<br>
      "One should not be scared by the excessive pressure. 80 metres are not too 
      deep", Kuteinikov said. <br>
      He regretted that the Finnish and Swedish authorities had not requested 
      the Russian rescuers to help with the 'Estonia' shipwreck. "We have a big 
      experience in underwater work, as well as good and maybe the best equipment. 
      It is a pity that we did not join efforts. Moreover, there are our citizens 
      in distress", Kuteinikov complained. The chief designer believes that the 
      main cause of the disaster was a poor training level of the crew. Besides, 
      it is also clear that the ship had some design faults. "Ships of the 'Estonia' 
      class do not sink in five minutes. They can overturn, but should stay afloat 
      for several hours to a whole day", he said." </i></font></p>
