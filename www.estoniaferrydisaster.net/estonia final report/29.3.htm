  The Car Deck</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Very little is known 
    about the inside of the car deck except for the observations made when the 
    diver went down (up) the starboard inner bulkhead, inside the ramp towards 
    the car deck. A lot of pallets and dunnage were noted to be piled up to the 
    left of his way, with other debris and what appeared to be parts of the ramp 
    rails mixed between. Behind the debris at least one, probably two big holes 
    in the bulkhead are visible which will be discussed in Chapter 32. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Although the upper 
    part of the ramp opening was considerably damaged indicating that something 
    big had smashed against it, no scoring marks are visible and the area of the 
    inner bulkhead is covered by the above-mentioned debris. It is possible that 
    this damage was caused by the visor - see Chapter 31 - during the casualty 
    sequence-of-events.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The condition of 
    the bow ramp flaps on the car deck side have already been explained in the 
    previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - and the big hole noted in the port 
    inner bulkhead below the control panel and adjacent to the port outer ramp 
    hinge will be discussed in Chapter 32. In spite of various attempts and although 
    the supervisor frequently said so, the ROV was apparently never inside the 
    car deck according to the evaluation of Disengage - see Disengage Report Subchapter 
    34.6 - and if the ROV actually should have been inside the car deck it definitely 
    did not enter it via the opening at the bow ramp but then it must have been 
    through such a big hole in the starboard shell plating that the edges were 
    not visible while the ROV moved through. This is doubtful but cannot be excluded 
    because the relevant part of the Sprint ROV video tape B40b has been cut several 
    times. - See Subchapter 34.6. in any event on the uncensored part of this 
    tape cement bags on pallets shrinked by plastic foil and other cargo parts, 
    however no truck or trailers, can bee seen which then has to be on the seabed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This immediately 
    raises the question of how they got there because it is most unlikely that 
    this cargo originates from another vessel as it looks rather new and unaffected 
    by sediments. It can also be excluded that the cargo fell out of the open 
    bow ramp when the vessel was upside down because she was then down by the 
    stern and it is physically impossible for pallets to move off some truck or 
    trailer on to the car deck and then ahead on to the bow ramp and then to fall 
    off the bow ramp. This leaves a sufficiently big hole in the shell plating 
    in way of the forward starboard side of the car deck which indeed cannot be 
    excluded and is - as a matter of fact - the only possibility. As the observations 
    described above were made by the ROV on 3 December 1994, i.e. more than 2 
    months after the casualty, there are two possibilities, viz.: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) heavy objects 
      from inside the car deck crashed against the shell plating and broke through 
      it either during the big heel, which is unlikely, and/or subsequently<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) a hole 
      was blown or flame-cut from the outside into the car deck to get access 
      after the casualty. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to be able 
    to explain further observations on the car deck by survivors also the fire-fighting 
    system installed here - a sprinkler system called Drencher system - has to 
    be explained as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck 
      there were also heat-sensors installed, which activated control lights on 
      the bridge indicating the particular area. By pushing a respective bottom 
      the watch officer started the fire pump and activated one or more quick-opening 
      valves of the sprinkler system installed underneath the car deck ceiling, 
      i.e. below the 4th deck. This sprinkler fire protection system was spraying 
      water out of nozzles under high pressure all over the area and the fire 
      pump was continuously pumping water into the system. This sprinkler pump 
      could also be activated from the ECR and from the sprinkler room (B-deck 
      level in the aft part of the centre casing). It was connected to the emergency 
      generator. This means that this pump has been running until the vessel was 
      more or less on the side. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In this connection 
      the observation of passenger Juuse Veljo is of importance who testified 
      among others <i>"On my way down the port side in about the middle of the 
      ship I reached the fender bar and heard the noise of pumps. While I was 
      still sitting on the edge the light started to blink."</i> - See his statement 
      <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/20.245.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      20.245</a>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    emergency generator then still running was supplying power to three pumps, 
    viz.: the bilge pump, the fire pump and the sprinkler pump. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is possible that 
    the sprinkler pump was then still running together with the bilge pump, which 
    according to Margus Treu, Henrik Sillaste and Hannes Kadak was also running 
    already since or even before the big heel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Furthermore there 
    are some observations/indications which could point to a fire in the forward 
    part of the car deck. These are</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) the statement 
    of the watch engineer Margus Treu that a jet of water hit the lens of the 
    video camera transferring pictures from the partly open bow ramp to the monitor 
    in the engine control room (ECR) where he was watching - see his statement 
    dated 29.09.94 Turku - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.263.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.3.263.</a> Treu believed that this water jet came from the partly open 
    bow ramp, which however is not possible because the camera is fitted at the 
    forward part of the centre casing underneath the ceiling. The distance to 
    the bow ramp is 25 m and the height above car deck is about 5 m - see the 
    pictures below taken on board the near-sister DIANA II where the camera was 
    installed as on ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg919.JPG" width="394" height="237"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can thus be excluded 
    that water penetrating the bow ramp at that relatively early stage could have 
    reached the camera in such high position as much as the car deck between bow 
    ramp and camera was full of trucks and cars.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is much more 
    likely that the camera lens was hit by a jet of water from the sprinkler installation 
    which had been activated manually in the forward part of the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) It has been 
    explained in the previous Subchapter 29.2 - The Bow Area - that the lower 
    part of the ramp in way of the two flaps in the middle was noted to be reddish/brown 
    with the flaps being bent and distorted and possible damage to car deck plating. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The passenger 
    Bengt Nilsson has testified that he saw white powder and foam inside the centre 
    casing on car deck level next to the 4th car deck door from forward on starboard 
    side. He rushed past this door on his way up when the vessel heeled abruptly 
    to starboard and he had to hold with his hands against the wall when he noted 
    the above. It was so fresh that the foam was still running down the wall. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The coded fire 
    alarm for the crew "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" was heard from the loud speakers, 
    though only after the big heel when there was already full panic. It meant 
    that Fire Group No. 1 had to assemble below the starboard bridge wing on deck 
    8 and Fire Group No. 2 had to assemble on the car deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) There are indications 
    that the crew had been active on the car deck before the big heel. See the 
    statement of Altti Hakanp‰‰ - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.3.333.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.3.333</a> and the different statements of Margus Treu in respect of his 
    seeing Silver Linde on the car deck - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.261.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    21.2.3.261</a> - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.273.htm" target="_blank">21.2.3.273</a>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) It is certain 
    that the crew knows much more about what happened on the car deck, but remain 
    silent, so far. It has to be assumed that this knowledge relates to the circumstances 
    described in Chapter 32 - Unexplained Damage. </font></p>
