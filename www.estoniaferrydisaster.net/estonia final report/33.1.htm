  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3">33.1<br>
    The "DIANA II" Incident in January 1993</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As this relatively 
    minor incident was made into a near catastrophe by the Nordic media with the 
    visor allegedly almost lost, clarification was needed and thus the matter 
    was also investigated by this 'Group of Experts' with the following result:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">DIANA II was 
    delivered by Meyer Werft in 1979 as forerunner and near-sister of the ESTONIA. 
    The DIANA II as well as the VIKING SALLY (later ESTONIA) were trading in the 
    Viking Line service between Stockholm-Mariehamn-Turku until 1990. From the 
    chief mate Karl Ole Lindroos, who had practically been on board from the time 
    of delivery until 1990, as well as from the mate and master Thorsten Söder, 
    who served in this rank for many years, the following information has been 
    received:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It was well known 
    to all navigators that the bow visor was the most sensitive part of the vessel 
    and was endangered in head-on seas at too high speed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor was the 
    responsibility of the chief mate who also opened and closed it. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were always 
    problems at the time of opening and closing the bolt of the Atlantic lock, 
    so that the bolt was finally thinned by 5 mm. After the visor had once been 
    lowered with already closed bolt of the Atlantic lock, the bolt had to be 
    renewed. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Before it was possible 
    to open the locking devices it was necessary to press the visor hydraulically 
    down as otherwise the bolts could not have been opened respectively closed 
    hydraulically against the pressure of the rubber packings.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the winter 
    time there were always problems with the rubber packings being frozen to the 
    visor bottom.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It often occurred 
    that the visor closed with a loud "bang" as the man at the operating panel 
    could not see the respective position of the visor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> About one year 
    before changing from the Slite Line to the Trelleborg-Rostock Line (TR Line) 
    the pistons of the hydraulic cylinders were newly coated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the bankruptcy 
    of Slite Line in 1992 DIANA II was taken over by TR Line on basis of a bareboat. 
    At first the Slite crew remained partly on board. Thorsten Söder and Lennart 
    Elfors remained masters and Karl Ole Lindroos was one of the two chief mates 
    for several months.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was 
    engaged in the Rostock-Trelleborg service and made three trips daily, two 
    of which were carried out during the daylight at full speed and one during 
    the night with the speed reduced to ca. 12 kn. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the morning of<b> 
    16 January 1993</b> during the voyage from Rostock to Trelleborg - i.e. two 
    days after the hurricane in which the JAN HEWELIUSZ sank - there was again 
    a storm of Bft. 10 blowing. Captain Söder was already on board the DIANA II 
    to take-over the command from Captain Elfors after arrival in Trelleborg. 
    The vessel proceeded through the very rough sea at ca. 12 kn. The chief mates 
    Lindroos and Hartwigsson were on their handing-over round just in the forward 
    part of the car deck when they noticed water leaking through the bow ramp. 
    After the vessel had reached the shelter of the shore, both mates entered 
    the inside of the visor through the hatch on the forecastle deck and found 
    considerable damage to the hydraulic side locks (the manual side locks were 
    not engaged) as well as to the Atlantic lock. After arrival the Classification 
    Society B.V., Sjöfartsverket as well as TR Line were immediately informed 
    and the responsible TR inspector instructed the master to have the damage 
    repaired prior to the next departure.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ship's command 
    entered the following remarks into the logbook:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Upon arrival 
        Trelleborg the following damage was found to the bow visor: Locking devices 
        out of order, starboard side lost, port side bent, Atlantic lock ca. 2-3 
        cm cracked, cracks in starboard side web, cracks in the starboard hinge."</i><br>

</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">An inspection was 
    carried out by the B.V. surveyor Axel Gall after commencement of repairs on 
    16 January 1993 and after completion of same on 17 January 1993 - see the 
    B.V. Survey Report <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.1.425.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly 
    the following damage was found: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>- The lug for 
      starboard lock plunger was lost;<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      the lug in centre line (the "Atlantic lock") was bent and the weld cracked;<br>
      - the lug for port side plunges was bent and the weld cracked;<br>
      - a minor crack at hinge on starboard side;<br>
      - the girder in centre line and two webs on starboard side cracked. </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following repairs 
    were carried out by Trelleborg Industri- & Byggservice AB and their invoice 
    with working sheets is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.1.426.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

      - the crack at starboard hinge chiselled and welded;<br>
      - the cracks at the girder and the webs chiselled and welded.</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the presence 
    of the B.V. surveyor, Captain Söder informed Sjöfarts-inspektionen Malmö - 
    Åke Sjöblom - and invited them for survey. However, due to lack of time this 
    was allegedly not possible and Sjöblom confirmed that the survey carried out 
    by B.V. was sufficient and the repairs would be inspected later. Actually 
    this was performed ca. three months later by the Safety Inspector Nilsson, 
    according to the logbook entry.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The B.V. lawyer 
    Johnsson from Stockholm wrote in a letter to Dr. Peter Holtappels on the incident 
    as follows: </font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»According to 
      the Captain in command of the DIANA II two officers discovered the damages 
      at sea. For some time it had been "wet" on the forward ramp and crew members 
      at sea went down between the forward ramp and the visor to see if the packing 
      was leaking significantly. When they went down, the damages to the visor 
      were discovered. On arrival at Trelleborg on 16 January 1993, they had a 
      close look while the visor was opened. Thereafter the repairs were ordered 
      through TR-Line in Trelleborg. The captain said that the weather had been 
      bad for a few days, 15-25 m/s high waves, and it was dark. Thus, the damages 
      might have happened several days before the 16 January 1993. He does not 
      know when or under what circumstances the damages were suffered. The captain 
      advised the chief surveyor of Malmö Inspectorate about the damages on 16 
      January 1993 by telephone.« </i></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    ship's command the torn off starboard lug was lost. This is possible as first 
    the lug hangs on the bolt of the hydraulic locking device and after opening 
    the same it falls into the water. As noticed from the letter of the B.V. lawyer 
    Johnsson, the repairs had already been commenced when the B.V. surveyor boarded 
    the vessel. Thus practically neither the class nor the safety board ever saw 
    the damage in its original condition. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ship's 
    command was unable to attribute the damage to a special occurrence, such as 
    a hard blow of the sea. Therefore the TR Line inspector Griesmaier is of the 
    opinion that the damage to the locking devices occurred over a longer period. 
    This would be in conformity with among other things the statements of the 
    chief mate Karl Ole Lindroos.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> DIANA II remained 
    in charter with TR Line until the end of September 1994. Since June 1994 Nordström 
    & Thulin had become interested in the ship, in order to take her into their 
    Stockholm-Tallinn service in addition to the ESTONIA. First inspections were 
    carried out which included checking of the B.V. survey reports on board, thus 
    inspector Hobro saw the B.V. report concerning the broken/cracked locks of 
    the visor. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the ESTONIA 
    sank, the take-over was quickly performed. On 29 Sept-ember 1994 in the presence 
    of the B.V. surveyor Kirchhoff and the N&T inspector Hobro, all locking devices 
    were opened and closed with closed visor, the indicator lights were checked 
    and all found to be in order. The vessel remained in Warnemünde until 4 or 
    5 October 1994. As a consequence of the ESTONIA accident the bow visor was 
    welded closed, however, broke open again during her subsequent voyage to Turku.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After the take-over, 
    Nordström & Thulin instructed Messrs. Turbo Technik of Wilhelmshaven to inspect 
    the bow visor and its locking devices and the following was ascertained:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>- Inspection 
        of the hinges by means of the "dye-check" method showed no cracks;<br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
        the play between the bolt and the lugs of the Atlantic lock was measured 
        to be 35 mm and was different from lug to lug - including bolt / visor 
        lug;<br>
        - the prevailing pressure was to forward, thus the play was only aft;<br>
        - the lugs were oval as were the bushings;<br>
        - the bushing for the spring loaded securing bolt fitted to the bushing 
        between the port and the centre lugs was present;<br>
        - the visor lug was oval and fixed to a bar, running diagonally upwards. 
        This was not in conformity with the lug as per drawing No. 48611-373;<br>
        - at the centre and port lugs and possibly at the sensor plate there were 
        two angle bars in athwartships direction, from where a pipe was leading 
        to the cross beam of the 3rd stringer level of the visor;<br>
        - below this cross beam (round) a double T-beam was fitted, probably to 
        give the visor more transverse strength in the bow wave area (ice);<br>
        - the sensors should have been fitted to the 2nd stringer level (mode 
        of operation unclear at present); <br>
        - all three lugs of the Atlantic lock had been rewelded to the forepeak 
        deck;<br>
        - the lug of the starboard side lock was not original.</font></i></p>

    The "HABIB" Visor Damage on 04.10.78 </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally attention 
    shall be drawn to one visor damage which occurred outside the Baltic Sea area 
    in the Western Mediterranean sea. It concerns the brand new car/passenger 
    ferry HABIB also classed by B.V. and built for the Tunisian owners Cotunav, 
    Tunis, for service between Tunis-Genua-Marseille by the Nobiskrug Shipyard/Rendsburg 
    in 1978. The vessel has a length of 145.73 m, a breadth of 23.51 m and a draught 
    of 6.16 m. The service speed is 23 kn. The bow ramp was regarded as upper 
    extension of the collision bulkhead above the bulkhead deck and connected 
    to the visor. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 4 October 
    1978 the ferry was on voyage from Tunis to Marseille when at 01.10 hours the 
    course was changed to the west and at 02.15 hours to 320° towards Marseille; 
    wind: West Bft. 9-10, speed 15.8 kn. From 07.00 hours onwards they were sailing 
    under the French coast. Around 11.00 hours it was noticed that the locking 
    devices of the bow visor had broken and the visor was set to starboard.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was 
    lashed/secured, and the voyage was continued with reduced speed to Marseille.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was 
    temporarily closed and repaired during the following yard period. The locking 
    device system, built and installed by MacGregor, was reinforced after the 
    occurrence. </font></p>
