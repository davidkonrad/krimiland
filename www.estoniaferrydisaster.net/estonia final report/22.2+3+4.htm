  The EPIRB Buoys</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The ESTONIA 
    was equipped with two modern EPIRB buoys (Emergency Position Indicating Radio 
    Beacons) of type Kannad 406 F.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The last check of 
    the radio beacons was reported to have been made about one week prior to the 
    disaster by the radio operator. The check confirmed that the EPIRBs were in 
    full working order and it has to be assumed that both were left in "switched-on" 
    condition after the test.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Nevertheless, no 
    signals from the two buoys were received in the course of the rescue operation.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
    to the above information the vessels were tracked auto-matically (and apparently 
    recorded by radar), although it is stated in the Utö log that "the target 
    had been tracked by Utö radar only from 01.40-01.48 hours" and that "at 01.48 
    hours radar supervisor Eija Viiala lost the target from the screen". In another 
    report put into the INTERNET already on 01.10.94 by Kari Ili-Kuha from Tampere, 
    Finland it is stated: <i>»According to today's papers the ship seems to have 
    been in trouble already over one hour before the distress signal. </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A 
    female radar operator on duty in Utö fort noticed that the ship had gradually 
    gone astray from her normal route, so that by the time of the distress signal 
    the ship was already about 15 km South off the course and the signal was weak. 
    The operator was surprised that the ship had not called for help earlier if 
    they had problems. The ship had obviously had both engine and electrical problems. 
    It remains a mystery why the crew on the bridge delayed the alarm, didn't 
    they realise how serious the situation was? In the aftermath this is just 
    plain useless speculation, but had they acted earlier in giving the alarm 
    both in the ship and over the radio the number of casualties would likely 
    not have been as high as they are now.«</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Since "Eija" is 
    a female name in Finland, the radar operator Eija Viiala stated in the Utö 
    log could be identical to the "female radar operator" mentioned in the INTERNET 
    message quoted above, although accor-ding to the Utö log she tracked ESTONIA 
    only from 01.40-01.48 hours, when ESTONIA's stern was probably just settling 
    down on the sea bottom and her bow rose out of the water, thus ESTONIA could 
    not have changed her position very much during these 8 minutes. Two alleged 
    radar plots were received from the Finnish Navy in this respect which are 
    shown below.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Apparently the Navy 
    was more talkative in the early days as obvious from the quoted INTERNET message 
    which is apparently based on a newspaper report. The complete message is attached

    22.3.385.</a> <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to 
    find out what the Finnish Navy records had on file, a meeting was held with 
    Commander Vesa Ennevaara at the head office of the Finnish Navy in December 
    1998 and the results of the discussions are summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The 1994 radar 
      system was based on the equipment from the 1980s. The software was not as 
      comprehensive as the current one. The main difference was that the 1994 
      system did not record data in permanent memory, which the new system will 
      do when fully implemented. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tracking 
      units, such as radar stations, aeroplanes and ships etc pick up targets 
      and report all new objects to the next level op's centre. The acquisition 
      of targets involves all military arms (navy, air force and army) as well 
      as pilots, coast guard and customs. New targets are assigned a number ID 
      and as soon as identification is possible, either by VHF or visually, the 
      name of the object is determined. The new system will operate the identification 
      process also by radar transponder codes, combined with the old system.<br>
      Tracking was done by one radar station at a time - feeding data to the OP's 
      centre - until the target was formally "handed over" to the next tracking 
      station. At the same time an object could be visible and followed on the 
      screens of other tracking stations, as well, but they would not feed data 
      into the system.<br>
      Tracking details were stored and transmitted in bursts from radar stations 
      to the OP's centres. The data was stored in buffer memories. Overflow of 
      data in a buffer memory would automatically cause deletion of the oldest 
      data. Depending on the amount of data on each separate object this could 
      mean anything from hours to maybe a full day or more of data remained in 
      each buffer. The buffer for Estonia (if the ship was within range and was 
      tracked at all, which according to Ennevaara is unclear) probably would 
      have contained data all the way from Tallinn/Nayssaar, but no one thought 
      to ask for it imme-diately after the accident. All old data was lost due 
      to the lack of memory storage space and unavailability of such a software 
      facility in 1994, because when the and rescue operation commenced much older 
      information was quickly lost from the buffers since intense tracking at 
      short time differentials will rapidly fill a buffer.<br>
      The area of interest to the Navy Command charged with synchronising the 
      rescue efforts was narrow, comprising the area between Utö and Hangö only. 
      According to Commander Ennevaara no one thought about saving historical 
      tracking data from other areas in time.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is obviously wrong as far as the ESTONIA is concerned, because the plot received 
    and which is titled "40H 28/09/94 ESTONIA" was sent by fax on the day of the 
    casualty - 28.09.94 - at 16.45 hours to the Navy's head office, thus then 
    the stored data must still have been available as also confirmed by the also 
    received list of times/positions/ bearings which reportedly refer to the radar 
    station Örö (between Russarö [Hangö] and Utö). While the times and positions 
    are mostly reflected by the plot, the bearing/speed items do not make sense 
    and are - according to the Navy - based on the Coast Artilleries' own system 
    which they could not explain.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Any ship could 
      enter Finnish territorial waters at night, without being properly identified, 
      and leave again - unless the manoeuvre was interesting enough to cause an 
      investigation. After such a visitor had left, the buffer memory would be 
      used again when needed and such historical data would be lost. Coast guard 
      stations, responsible for shipping security, would sometimes call such targets 
      (ships) to advise them if they were heading towards danger. In case there 
      was reply a positive ID would have been established - otherwise none at 
      all. This could be the case irrespective of whether a target was a "red" 
      object, unless this was known in advance and the target duly picked up and 
      identified by plane or surface ship.«</i></font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Coast guard 
      radars are not operated by dedicated and trained personnel on uninterrupted 
      duty - like the Navy and Air Force radar stations are. Even when tracking, 
      the operator may leave the radar set for coffee or lunch or even for watch 
      duty, without a replacement at the screen. Coast guard, pilot and customs 
      radars are commercial equipment, without the refined electronics of military 
      equipment. Range and resolving power, as well as tracking accuracy are therefore 
      inferior. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      most reliable plotting is always obtained by hand. Plots obtained from stored 
      data is always less reliable and contains spurious data. This is due to 
      the fact that stored data contains past, present and predicted data. The 
      predicted data may be incorrect and will be corrected on the next sweep 
      or data transfer sequence. Even a stationary target will thus from time 
      to time show a vector although it does not move at all. <br>
      The Navy's Estonia track was obtained from stored "buffer data" and is therefore 
      not entirely reliable, besides not having an absolutely reliable identification 
      (name of the ship). Nevertheless, according to Commander Ennevaara the Navy 
      is about 90% sure that it was the Estonia. The plot in question is layed 
      into chapter 22.<br>
      If it was not the Estonia, it would be an unidentified vessel. The radar 
      weather was said to have been very bad and the radio communications were 
      frequently interrupted according to the Utö radar station notes.«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 
    any event, the radar observer Eija Viiala saw a radar target which she believed 
    to have been the ESTONIA from the time she took over from Örö radar station 
    apparently at 00.33 hours. Apparently she told the local newspaper shortly 
    after the casualty what she had seen for more than 1 hour before the 'Mayday' 
    at 01.22 hours, which makes it even more difficult to understand why the respective 
    data should not have been secured although the respective data of all the 
    other vessels were secured.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Commander Ennevaara 
    explained instead that</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»the radar range 
      was only barely sufficient to pick up the site of the accident due to the 
      distance and the very bad radar weather. The track, designated Estonia by 
      the Navy, was named Estonia without any optical or secure identification 
      of the target. The identity has been checked backward from the known location 
      of the wreck by the Navy - but may have been an entirely different ship 
      as well.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Ennevaara offered 
    that the radar operators may be interviewed and that the station logs be searched 
    which, to his knowledge, has never been done so far.</font></p>

    time reasons it has also not been done by this 'Group of Experts".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In reply to a respective 
    question Commander Ennevaara said that</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »the Finnish Intelligence 
      service in 1994 did not listen with the objective of locating the transmissions 
      but in order to <i>pick up contents of messages. Interesting messages would 
      be transmitted to op's centres without confidentiality. (This of course 
      must depend on the contents of the intercepted message, although Commander 
      Ennevaara did not say so.)«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In a subsequent 
    telephone interview the watch officer of SILJA EUROPA, Teijo Seppelin (the 
    MARIELLA witnesses could not be reached), stated the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»- as far as 
      he could see, the Estonia was never in front of SILJA EUROPA - but came 
      up from the south-east. This track would be different from the Navy radar 
      track designated Estonia - and would be similar to the one put forward by 
      the JAIC. Seppelin said that the Estonia normally came up straight from 
      the south-east, i.e. from what must have been the Estonia/Nayssaar sound 
      and crossed the track of the SILJA EUROPA. One crew of the Estonia would 
      arrogantly cross the SILJA EUROPA track close under the bow and force the 
      Officer to pull back on the engines, while the other crew would always pass 
      politely under the stern. This was in the summer when the SILJA EUROPA entered 
      at Sandhamn and the Estonia at Söderarm.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 
      he does not believe that the Navy track is that of the Estonia. Neither 
      does the officer (Capt. Ltn. Niemelä from Utö), who was in charge of the 
      radar station, primarily because the Navy track follows the normal routing 
      system, initially west then, west-south-west. <br>
      - he does not recall radio interruptions but remembers that the MARIELLA's 
      inability to reach Helsinki Radio on VHF Ch 16 and MF 2182 was widely discussed 
      afterwards. He recalls the Mayday signals were of distinctly different character, 
      one very weak and the other quite normal in strength.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for the 
    Finnish Navy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> While searching 
    through the files of the public prosecutor in Stockholm a copy was found referring 
    to a drawing belonging to an article which had appeared in the Estonian newspaper 
    ILTA-SANOMAT on 01.10.1994. It shows the deviation of ESTONIA to the South 
    of the normal route (see interview above of the Utö radar observer in the 
    INTERNET message - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.3.385.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    22.3.385</a>) and the apparent existence of another vessel in the vicinity 
    of the casualty position, viz. the BALANGA QUEEN which had allegedly passed 
    "very close" to the casualty position. On the above-mentioned copy it is handwritten 
    in Swedish:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»If the BALANGA 
      QUEEN had not been ahead of schedule and if ESTONIA had called for help 
      when her problems actually started, then hundreds of lives could have been 
      saved.«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Why ESTONIA's 
      emergency messages or other radio communica-tions were delayed and did not 
      reach BALANGA QUEEN is still unclear.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The (available) 
    files of the prosecutor do not contain any more documentation in regard to 
    BALANGA QUEEN nor do the (available) files of the Swedish and Finnish parts 
    of the JAIC. The logbook page 2 is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.3.386.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    22.3.386</a>. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently 
    another INTERNET search was performed and under the date 29.09.94 the following 
    was found:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Not that my 
      opinion of Estonian seamen is much higher. The papers quote surviving truck 
      drivers who had asked why their trucks were not chained to their places, 
      stormy weather and all. "It's not necessary', they were answered. And there 
      was an Estonian passenger ship, Balanga something, that was only 30 sea 
      miles south of "Estonia" but didn't pick up the emergency signal while four 
      Finnish ones did and went to help.«</i></font></p>

      Swedish and English. No response. The ship passed the lighthouse, averted 
      the first rocks by sheer luck, then turned sharply to south and safety. 
      After radio contact was established the captain of the "Leonid Bykov" explained 
      that the fresh First Officer keeping watch didn't know any English, but 
      when the radio messages continued, he figured out that maybe he needed to 
      wake up the captain (who had made the safety move).<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above is the 
    only comment made by a member of the JAIC to the effect that the casualty 
    might have been caused by "not properly" or even "opened" doors. <br>
    Thereby it is unclear whether the visor - also called 'bow door' or the 'bow 
    ramp', sometimes also called 'door' or 'gate' - is meant.<br>
    It is also interesting that the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, told the 
    press that he had been informed about the catastrophe already at about 03.00 
    hours, while the Finnish Government, first of all the Prime Minister, was 
    informed only at 04.55 hours and the other Government members thereafter until 
    about 05.40 hours. At that time the chairman of the Finnish part of the JAIC, 
    Kari Lethola, was already on his way to Turku. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand, MRCC Helsinki did inform MRCC Tallinn at 02.55 hours, but <i>"not in 
    detail, only that something had happened and that people were in distress",</i> 
    whilst subsequently - at 10.05 hours - the Finnish Minister of the Interior 
    Pekkavinen told the press that <i>"the Estonian Authorities were informed 
    at 02.00 hours by the Finnish Authorities".<br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently 
    there were "other authorities" also involved in the casualty which had nothing 
    to do with the rescue services and which must have been informed already that 
    ESTONIA was in trouble while the vessel was still afloat.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It also has 
    to be assumed with certainty that there had been intense communication between 
    the ESTONIA and Tallinn, at least during the last hour, and that ESCO knew 
    what was going on onboard the ESTONIA much before the first, weak 'Mayday' 
    was received by MARIELLA. Officially 137 persons survived the catastrophe, 
    93 bodies were brought ashore and identified, and 759 persons are officially 
    missing. These figures do not include the Iraqis in the trailer on the car 
    deck, the unregistered Pakistanis and the also unregistered relatives of crew 
    members also said to have been on board. </font></p>
