  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For details reference 
    is made to the drawing showing the forward part of 0-deck and 1st deck which 
    is attached to the end of this Subchapter as well as to the GA plan. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The passenger accommodation 
    was accessible by 2 personal lifts and 6 stairways inside the centre casing. 
    The forward lift and the stairway in the 4th compartment continued down to 
    0-deck level (swimming pool, saunas), the other lift ended on 1st deck level. 
    Both lifts had only non-watertight doors to starboard with 100 mm sills on 
    the car deck, while the doors on 1st deck opened to port only and on 0-deck 
    to both sides.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The store area was 
    accessible by 3 large lifts and 1 stairway. The first store lift had a door 
    to starboard, while the second one had doors to both sides. Both store lifts 
    had no sills at all and led down to the 1st deck in way of the engine room. 
    At the aft end of the centre casing a container lift of 10' x 8' x 8' was 
    installed which led down to the 1st deck only. The doors opened to the aft 
    and also had no sill. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The sliding doors 
    on car deck level leading from car deck into the centre casing above the 1st 
    deck had sills of 130 mm above the 100 mm sill running around the entire centre 
    casing just interrupted in way of the 2 store lifts, i.e. the sills of the 
    sliding doors had a total height of 230 mm. None of the lift doors were watertight. 
    All 4 lifts went up to the 8th deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As the 1st deck 
    was located below the bulkhead deck the compartments were separated by watertight 
    bulkheads which, in way of the passenger accommodations, were only interrupted 
    by the longitudinal alleyway. The openings could be closed by watertight doors 
    operated hydraulically either from a panel on the bridge or manually on site. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The doors were sliding 
    doors, closing from port to starboard. The hydraulic station for these doors 
    was located about midships in the centre casing on 2nd car deck (B-deck) level. 
    Before and during the closing of the doors yellow flashlights went on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The passenger accommodation 
    was divided into 6 watertight compartments of which the first compartment 
    was located directly behind the empty ballast water tank No. 2 and above the 
    three freshwater tanks 4A, 4B, 5 which were all said to be full with in total 
    291 ts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 2nd and 3rd 
    compartments were directly above the sauna/ swimming pool area, the 4th compartment 
    was at starboard side above the sewage plant belong to the engine room and 
    at port side above 2 conference rooms. The 5th and 6th compartments were located 
    above the heeling tanks, two centre heavy fuel tanks and the stabiliser fin 
    spaces. The void spaces in between were connected to the engine room area.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the following 
    statements of survivors from the 1st deck shall be quoted commencing with 
    the survivors in the cabins in the most forward compartment - the 1st compartment, 
    followed by the 2nd compartment and so on. </font></p>

    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Övberg has made statements 
    on 29.09.94 and on 10.10.94, he was interviewed by Jutta Rabe of Spiegel TV 
    on 13.03.96 and frequently by members of this 'Group of Experts' in the course 
    of 1997, the results of which are summarised in his statement dated 09.09.97 
    - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151</a>. The most relevant parts of this statement in connection with 
    the casualty scenario shall be quoted as follows:</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - at about 22.30 
    hours (Swedish time) down to the cabin and to bed;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he woke up 
    suddenly from the strong noise of rushing water which he could hear from both 
    sides, but loudest from starboard side; these noises alarmed him;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- in addition 
    he heard quite strong metallic banging noises which definitely had not been 
    there before; he sat up in bed and put his feet on the floor, since the bed 
    was athwartships he was facing the door looking aft;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he lit a 
    cigarette and listened intently to the strange and frightening noise scenario;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- after a little 
    while he suddenly heard the starting up noise of an hydraulic pump or pumps 
    followed by the clicking of valves and then the typical noise created by an 
    hydraulic system under load;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- simultaneously 
    he heard the banging of sledge hammers;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the noises 
    came probably from forward;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the hydraulic 
    under load noise faded away and came back again whilst the sledge-hammer banging 
    noise more or less continued. Both the hydraulic noise and the sledge-hammer 
    banging noise continued for ca. 10-15 minutes whilst the other banging noises, 
    then heard already for some 20-25 minutes, also continued; <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the hydraulic 
    noise and the sledge-hammer noise stopped with a short, sharp metallic crash 
    which gave him the impression that something heavy, metallic had broken; <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- after a 'silence' 
    of 30-40 seconds the next really extreme crash followed in connection with 
    an abrupt stopping of the ferry which was so 'sudden' that he was thrown against 
    the front wall of his bed;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">it was a short, 
    sharp intense crash as if the ship had struck against something;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he jumped 
    out of his bed and put his clothes on very quickly when he realised that all 
    the engine noises had stopped and that the ferry was now making much softer 
    pitch movements;this must have been at about 01.00 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he rushed 
    out of his cabin, turned right towards the stairway, around the aft part of 
    it, through the open WT-door (watertight) towards aft, but turned around after 
    some meters and headed forward, by now the vessel had started making sideway 
    movements (rolling), the door at the port side of the stairway was either 
    open or missing, and he rushed through it; <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he turned 
    right up the stairs when his coat got caught at the beginning of the right 
    handrail, he turned round to his right and looked over his right shoulder 
    out through the door opening into the alleyway;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he saw 2 
    goosenecks next to the cabin wall, as indicated on the drawing on the pages 
    517/518;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- out of these 
    goosenecks water was streaming under great pressure, he also saw water penetrating 
    the door forward of these goosenecks in the 3rd compartment which belonged 
    to a cleaning room; <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he saw the 
    water running over the floors;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he had freed 
    his jacket and he rushed up the stairs;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when he was 
    about half way up to the car deck the vessel heeled suddenly and abruptly 
    more than 45°, probably 50° or 60°;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: 
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The reason 
    for Övberg estimating this large angle of heel is the fact that he was standing 
    on the wall, as shown by the drawing below to his statement and on the following 
    paragraph. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the ferry quickly 
    came back to almost upright position but then heeled about 10° to 15° to starboard 
    and thereafter slowly heeled in steps further to starboard, which each rolling 
    movement a little bit more. Övberg continued upwards, i.e. when the ferry 
    rolled backed to almost upright condition, he rushed upwards as far and as 
    fast as he could and when the ferry subsequently heeled wide to starboard, 
    he stood waiting and holding fast to the rails of the stairs, etc., his way 
    up is demonstrated by a further drawing above;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- he reached the 
    7th deck and managed to get out through the open door whereafter he saw at 
    once the lights of one ferry at port side;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    means that the vessel was then already on a south-easterly heading. - there 
    was one light shining from the port bridge wing, otherwise the bridge was 
    dark. Note: This is a key statement which gives a great deal of explanation 
    because Carl Övberg could be questioned in detail and because he was very 
    co-operative. There can be no doubt that many of the survivors could give 
    considerably more details if they would have been asked properly by the JAIC. 
    Another unforgivable mistake of the JAIC who had the authority and the means 
    of carrying out a detailed interrogation of all the survivors, however, did 
    not make use of it.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Martin had told 
    the police that his cabin no. was 1027, however, according to the drawing 
    he made showing his way up, it was cabin no. 1028. The drawing is attached 
    to his statement, which can be summarized as follows: - He went to bed at 
    23.00-23.30 hours, noticed heavy movements of the vessel and lots of cracking 
    noises. He also heard that something was frequently heavily beating against 
    the vessel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - About 10-15 minutes 
    before the accident became a fact, i.e. before the big heel, he woke up from 
    the heavy movements of the vessel, heard a scraping noise, i.e. it was cracking 
    and scraping very close to him on the deck above him. This was (for him) the 
    introduction to the developments which ended in the catastrophe;<br>
    - <b>A little later Martin felt that the noises were connected to the shaking 
    of the vessel, and then the vessel began to heel noticeably. He and his bed 
    moved upwards while the others in their beds on the opposite side of the cabin 
    moved downwards. He is unable to explain this in more detail. Simultaneously 
    the strong scraping noise was being continuously heard and then Jan Gustavsson 
    said: <i>"Now we have run aground." </i>So clear and distinct was this noise; 
    </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 
    noises associated with "running aground" cannot originate from above but must 
    have come from below, this was probably a wrong description or memory of Martin 
    Nilsson. Below him were the starboard heeling tank and the pocket of the starboard 
    stabiliser.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He left the cabin 
    and jumped up one flight of stairs to the next deck (car deck), where he noted 
    several centimetres of water on the floor;<br>

    reached the boat deck he observed two crew members talking into walkie-talkies;<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- A search 
    light was shining from vessel's side into the water; the lights went out/on

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of these

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) 21 passengers 
      from the 1st deck survived. This is a comparatively high number, bearing 
      in mind that from all the six accommodation decks only 137 persons (official 
      number) had survived, because the survivors from deck 1 had by far the longest 
      and most difficult way to deck 7. Presum-ably because they had been warned 
      early through their proximity to the noise scenario, they had therefore 
      left their cabins earlier and faster than many of those from the upper decks 
      had done.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) 9 reported 
      water on the 1st deck, of which two noted the water already <b>before </b>the 
      big heel, but the others only one minute or more thereafter. 4 reported 
      a lot of water up to 0.4 m high which was rushing very quickly respectively 
      under pressure. Thus water has been on the 1st and consequently also on 
      0-deck <b>before </b>the big heel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) 9 reported 
      water on car deck level inside the centre casing and/or penetrating the 
      car deck, of which one saw water directly on the car deck through a partly 
      open car deck door (most aft stairway for passengers). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(d) 14 reported 
      the abrupt wide heel (45°-60°), were thrown out of their beds and/or against 
      the walls etc., but only three reported that the ferry more or less righted 
      up thereafter, although it is absolutely clear that if the ferry had not 
      righted from a heel of 45°-60°, nobody would have been able to escape from 
      the 1st deck or would have been able to reach the outside of deck 7 from 
      any other deck. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) Water was reported 
      from the 1st, the 3rd, the 4th and the 5th compartments. In cabin 1120 located 
      in the first compartment in the centre line, on top of a full freshwater 
      tank the water penetrated the door from the alleyway, i.e. the water height 
      in the alleyway exceeded the height of the door sill. In the 3rd compartment 
      water was noted in the alleyway, probably originating from either the spiral 
      stairway or the lift casing. In the 4th compartment water was seen to escape 
      from 2 ventilation openings under high pressure. In the 5th compartment 
      water was reported to have penetrated the floor. All observations were made 
      either in the longitudinal alleyway in the centre line or in athwartships 
      alleyways at the starboard side only. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) The time for 
      the big heel was stated only by few survivors to have been just after 01.00 
      hours. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(g) <b>The noise 
      scenario:<br>
      </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most 
      of the survivors reported <b>at least one very heavy bang, crash, impact 
      combined with an abrupt stopping of the vessel as if the vessel had collided 
      with something,</b> which was so strong that they were thrown against the 
      walls, etc. Before this very dramatic crash/impact noise, which apparently 
      caused the vessel to stop abruptly and which was clearly before the sharp 
      and wide heels to starboard, there had been other noise scenarios heard 
      by survivors, which were different. While Carl Övberg was in his cabin in 
      the 4th compartment he heard hydraulic and sledge-hammer type banging noises. 
      The others further forward and aft heard howling, squeaking and, most dominantly, 
      scraping noises which were combined with the shaking of the vessel and which 
      sounded as if the vessel proceeded through ice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (n) This noise 
      scenario has been explained in detail to the diving and underwater explosives 
      expert Brian Braidwood, who has excluded, with a high degree of certainty, 
      that any of the noises heard by the survivors could have been caused by 
      explosions. See also Chapter 32. </font></p>
