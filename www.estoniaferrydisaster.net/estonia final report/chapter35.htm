  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In the afternoon of 28 September 
    1994 - the day of the casualty - the Prime Ministers of Estonia, Finland and 
    Sweden met in Turku and decided among other things that a Joint Accident Investigation 
    Commission (JAIC) should be set up "to investigate the capsizing of the ferry

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> In Estonia such an organisation 
    did not exist, but already early in the morning of the casualty day President 
    Lennart Meri had decided that in Estonia an independent commission should 
    be formed "to investigate the circumstances having led to the casualty and 
    the government organisations". (The Andi Meister book: "The Unfinished Logbook".) 
    This commission should consist of 11 members, mainly ministers and their representatives. 
    Chairman to be was the Minister for Transport and Communication, Andi Meister, 
    an engineer by profession. Captain Uno Laur, up to 1992 head of the navigation 
    department of ESCO and now a maritime consultant, was appointed by the President 
    to be his personal representative. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Prime Minister Maart Laar returned to 
    Tallinn that same evening and reported about the decision to form a joint 
    commission, five names from the above-mentioned 11 member commission were 
    selected and the embassies of Sweden and Finland were informed accordingly. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the same evening the Swedish JAIC members 
    together with the Swedish observer, Captain Sten Andersson from Sjöfartsverket, 
    flew over to Turku and met the Finnish members who had been on site since 
    the morning already and the first discussions between these two groups took 
    place.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the following morning, 29 September, the Swedish 
    and Finnish JAIC members met again and, after some further discussions, decided 
    to invite the Estonians to come over the for first joint meeting straight 
    away, which they did. By means of the Estonian Coast Guard plane the following 
    persons flew to Turku: </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">At 14.00 hours the first 
    meeting of the three-nations JAIC in Turku commenced which was attended by 
    the persons listed up in Enclosure 35.1.440. Among others things it was decided, 
    that Estonia should have the lead of the JAIC because the vessel had been 
    flying the Estonian flag. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently the three crew members considered 
    to be key witnesses were heard by the joint JAIC. See Subchapter 37.1.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the first meeting of the JAIC, also the 
    head of the Navigation Department of ESCO and Safety Adviser of Estline, Captain 
    Enn Neidre, was present, which apparently was considered to be normal procedure, 
    viz. that the manager responsible for officers and crew inside the organisation 
    of a shipping company is on-site when the survivors come ashore in order to 
    talk to them and prepare them to give evidence to the police subsequently, 
    that is to say, <i>"to remind them of their loyalty to their company"</i>. 
    That was actually done by Enn Neidre but he also attended the subsequent hearings 
    of the key witnesses Silver Linde, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak by the police 
    and the meanwhile formed JAIC. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The so-called key witnesses and other uninjured 
    crew members who returned to Tallinn on the evening of 29 September 1994 had 
    already been interrogated in Turku. Some of them, considered to be able to 
    give important evidence, up to three times, i.e. by the Finnish, Swedish and 
    Estonian police respectively security police. Upon arrival at the Tallinn 
    airport in the evening they were again interrogated by the Estonian criminal 
    and security police. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently it became obvious to the Estonians 
    in the course of the following days what really had gone wrong with the ESTONIA 
    and what it would mean for the reputation of the young state of Estonia if 
    the evidence given by some surviving crew members about the real causes for 
    the catastrophe would get to the public. It was thus decided to have somebody 
    with authority inside the JAIC, who was respected and feared by the crew and 
    who would - just by his presence - remind them of their "loyalty obligation" 
    to ESCO. This was Captain Enn Neidre, the head of the Navigation Department 
    of ESCO and safety adviser for Estline.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although in an <i>"Immediate Press Release"</i> 
    by the Foreign Ministry of Estonia on 10.10.94 at 17.00 hours - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/35.1.441.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    35.1.441</a> - Indrek Tarand is still mentioned as JAIC member, only half 
    an hour later in a further "Immediate Release" by the same Ministry - see 
    Enclosure 35.1.442 - his name was exchanged by that of Enn Neidre.<br>

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> So much for the newly formed/appointed 
    JAIC for the time being. The conflict of interests was programmed from the 
    very beginning and the members from Sweden and Finland were very much aware 
    of it. <i>"Estonia will bear the main responsibility for the investigation"</i>, 
    said Carl Bildt at the press conference in Turku following the decision of 
    the three Prime Ministers to form the JAIC, <i>"however in practice it will 
    be a joint commission because Estonia lacks the resources to carry out everything

    The Observers</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> While the Swedish Sjöfartsverket 
    did send their "observer", Captain Sten Andersson, already over to Turku on 
    the day of the casualty, the 28 September 1994, and also the Estonian National 
    Maritime Board (E.N.M.B.) was represented by the Director General, Captain 
    Kalle Pedak, already at the first meeting on 29 September 1994, Finland took 
    a bit longer, but as from 22.08.95 Jukka Häkämies attended all Commission 
    meetings in his capacity as head of the Division of Maritime Inspection of 
    the Finnish Board of Navigation. Consequently all three National Maritime 
    Administrations, having been responsible for the proper certification and 
    compliance of the ferry with SOLAS and other safety conventions were represented 
    at all the meetings of the JAIC, where among other things the failures and 
    omissions of their organisations were - or, at least, should have been - investigated 
    and they even participated in the final drafting of the Report of the JAIC 
    as will be shown later. </font></p>

    <br>
    The Police Liaisons</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Estonia did send their policeman 
    no. 2, Priit Männik, into the JAIC as an expert. Finland's police was represented 
    in the JAIC by Detective Chief Superintendent Hari Rahikka and for the Swedish 
    police this job was probably done by Olof Forssberg, who co-operated quite 
    closely with the investigating public prosecutor Birgitta Cronier at the beginning 
    and subsequently with prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><b><font size="3">35.7 
    <br>
    The Documentation </font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The Swedish and Finnish parts 
    of the JAIC were obliged by law to keep a register - logbook (<i>dagbok</i>), 
    into which the complete incoming and outgoing documentation had to be registered 
    day-by-day. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unknown what Estonian law requires in 
    this respect and how it was complied with by the Estonian part of the JAIC. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sweden a very detailed and accurate looking 
    logbook system was kept from the very beginning, although it does not contain 
    the complete documentation. In Finland apparently no system whatsoever does 
    exist. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swedish documentation is contained in 9 
    files A - J, as far as it is known, in which the documents were registered 
    with running numbers, in total more than 1000. The complete register is available 
    to this 'Group of Experts', but not attached to this report. While working 
    papers and other documents considered to be crucial for the investigation 
    were kept <i>"classified"</i> until the Final Report was published, most of 
    the documentation collected by the Swedish part of the JAIC as time went by 
    was open to the public although this was realised by very few people only. 
    After the publication of the Final Report everything should have been made 
    public according to applicable regulations. They were however not complied 
    with as certain documents known to have been in the possession of a member 
    of the JAIC cannot be traced in the files nor are they registered. This refers 
    especially to the repair lists from on board of ESTONIA in which the crew 
    was - among other things - asking for repair of the broken port outer hinge 
    of the bow ramp. According to Börje Stenström these lists have been in his 
    possession. </font></p>
