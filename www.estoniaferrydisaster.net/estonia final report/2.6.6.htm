  Actuating, monitoring and control systems for the visor,<br>
  the bow ramp and the stern ramps </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Hydraulic System 
    and Hydraulic Cylinders (Actuators) The hydraulic system of VIKING SALLY, 
    serving the car deck installations including visor and ramps, consisted of 
    3 pump stations, 2 big ones and 1 small one. The working pressure for the 
    big ones was about 250 bar and for the small one about 150 bar. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>1</b> big pump 
      station was placed in the stern part of the car deck on the starboard side 
      and served the port side stern ramp, the port side drive-on ramps, the port 
      side hanging decks. <br>
      <b>1</b> big pump station in the fore part of the car deck on the port side 
      served the bow visor, the bow ramp, the starboard stern ramp, the drive-on 
      ramps on starboard, and the starboard hanging decks. <br>
      <b>1</b> small pump station placed in the centre casing on B-deck level 
      served 2 pilot doors, 4 passenger doors, and 2 passenger bridges.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The big pump 
    stations</b> consisted of 1 oil tank each containing 900 litres and 3 pumps. 
    When the system was in normal operation 2 pumps were running and the 3rd one 
    was serving as a reserve unit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>The small pump 
    station</b> consisted of 2 pumps and 1 oil tank containing 150 litres. When 
    the system was in normal operation 1 pump was working and the other served 
    as a reserve unit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic system 
    was connected in parallel and the pumps were pressure compensated axial piston 
    pumps which delivered only the required quantity of oil. This quantity, required 
    by each user, was adjusted by throttle valves. The max. working pressure of 
    the pump station was regulated by a safety valve adjusted at newbuilding. 
    It came only into effect if the pressure would exceed the max. working pressure 
    to which the valve was adjusted and should never be changed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Upon failure of 
    one of the big pump stations the other one could be connected by switching 
    off the two shut-off valves of the failing pump station and by opening the 
    two valves located in the aft pump station, whereafter the "cross-over" between 
    the two hydraulic systems was established. The operating time was slightly 
    longer if the pump station aft was used to serve the forward system, i.e. 
    the bow visor, the bow ramp and drive-on ramps on starboard side. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 
    the hydraulic system of the actuators of the visor, bow and stern ramps do 
    have some relevance for the casualty scenario, its functioning shall be explained 
    in detail, whereby the figures refer to the sketch below:</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%201/pg131.jpg" width="373" height="506">

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing 
      slide valves were moved (19) from right to left, oil would flow from the 
      pressure pipes (P) to the piston undersides, the piston rods moved upwards 
      and the visor opened. The oil at the piston rod sides flowed undisturbed 
      through valves 39 into the return pipes (T).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When the distributing 
      slide valves were moved from left to right the oil flow reached in throttled 
      condition (39) the upper cylinder chambers (piston rod side). The pressure 
      in the upper cylinder chambers pushed the pistons downwards. Also the weight 
      of the visor acted on the pistons. At the underside of the pistons overpressure 
      developed as the stop valves (46) closed, the non-return valve (38) prevented 
      oil flow in this direction and the pressure limitation valves (15) were 
      not yet open. Only if excessive pressure had built up at the lower sides 
      of the pistons would the pressure limitation valves (15) open and the visor 
      move downwards.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - There were two 
      reasons for the installation of such valves (15). On the one hand such valves 
      prevented the rapid falling down of the visor in case of pipe and/or hose 
      failures, on the other hand the visor was unable to close by its own weight 
      only. Consequently it was possible to keep the visor in a partly open respectively 
      closed position. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In the case of 
      the bow and the stern ramps, which were connected to identical hydraulic 
      systems, it was the other way round because the weight of the ramps acted 
      in the opening direction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In case the 
      visor and bow as well as the stern ramps should be closed or kept closed 
      by hydraulic pressure, the piston rod sides had to be pressurized and the 
      actuators would retract respectively remain retracted. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
      following diagram shows part of the von Tell drawing 49111-387 with the 
      visor actuator - arrow 1 - and the bow ramp actuator - arrow 2 - with the 
      respective hydraulic systems, as explained on the previous pages, fitted 
      to the cylinders.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%201/pg133.jpg" width="606" height="838"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As these installations 
    were located in the void spaces above and below B-deck as it is visible from 
    the drawing on the next page, they were accessible for the crew. This means 
    that it has been possible to manipulate the valves at the visor and bow ramp 
    actuators from inside the side-houses without having to touch the control 
    panel on the car deck. By means of the above explained "cross-over" effected 
    at the aft hydraulic station - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.31.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.31</a> - it has also been possible to put pressure on the cylinders 
    of visor and bow ramp by means of the aft hydraulic station. In summary it 
    can thus be concluded that it was possible to put pressure on the actuators 
    of visor and bow ramp, i.e. to keep them closed by hydraulic pressure, without 
    having to use the control panel on the car deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can further be 
    concluded that it was possible to keep visor, bow and stern ramps in a semi-open/-closed 
    condition which, however, required the running of at least one hydraulic pump 
    under continuous load changes (on/off). The visor actuators were connected 
    to the vessel's B-deck by 2 lugs for each cylinder (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.4.79.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.4.79</a> - photo showing B-deck).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Below this deck there 
    were respective stiffeners and brackets fitted, which transferred the forces 
    into the vessel's structure. To lift the visor 118 ts. were required at each 
    cylinder. The maximum lifting power of 1 cylinder at a design pressure of 
    250 bar was 153 ts. The test pressure of the cylinders was 350 bar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the chief engineer Lars Karlsson the hydraulic pumps were changed in 1985/86 
    to more powerful ones which could produce a maxi-mum operating pressure of 
    400 bar. Reportedly the other components of the system remained unchanged. 
    - See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.5.60.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.4.5.60</a> 
    - and the class was not informed although this was a significant manipulation 
    of the system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Sensors/ indicator 
    lights/ control panels</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the time 
    of delivery the opening and closing procedures of bow visor and bow ramp were 
    controlled by in total 25 sensors of which 18 were magnetic limit switches 
    and 7 mechanical limit switches.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">With reference 
    to part of drawing 49111-871 - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.4.80.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure
