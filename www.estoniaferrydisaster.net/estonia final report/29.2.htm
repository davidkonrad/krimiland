    the broken parts of the visor hinge plates and the aft end of the visor arm 
    lower closing plate. - See the drawing below. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition images 
    2 and 4 show an area of burnt deck paint to starboard of the outer lug plate, 
    i.e. below the location of the bushing in normal condition. This indicates 
    that flame cutting had been carried out that close to the deck that the paint 
    became burnt.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Images 5 and 
    6 show the middle and outer part of the hinge bolt (3). The bolt moved out 
    of the hinges due to the list of the wreck and is ever since standing on the 
    adjacent railbar. There are three areas of green paint visible which are indicated 
    by red dots. Since only the deck was painted green it has to be assumed that 
    the green paint visible on the bolt was deck paint. The hinge arrangement 
    was a closed system without gaps between bushings and lug plates. This was 
    evidently no more the case when the green deck paint was able to reach the 
    bolt at least in three places! The explanation that this was possible can 
    also be found in Subchapter 12.5 and on the enlarged images attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.5.181</a>/<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.181.1.htm" target="_blank">12.5.181.1</a>, 
    i.e. the starboard visor hinge arrangement was totally misaligned with the 
    outer bushing sticking out too much which created the gaps between hinge plates/bushings 
    enabling the green paint to reach the bolt. The condition of the outer part 
    of the outer bushings of which the lower part was evidently cut off explains 
    the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The bolt had 
      only to some extent engaged the outer visor hinge plate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The burnt 
      off lower part of the bushing made it possible for the bushing to fall off 
      the bolt (contrary to the port where the bushing was intact and consequently 
      remained attached to the bolt - see the following item P 1).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) During the 
      flame cutting (burning) of the lower part of the said bushing the deck paint 
      below the bushing was burnt because of the narrow distance between the lower 
      part of the bushing and the green deck.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Image 4 shows also 
    scoring marks on the deck in front of the hinge plates evidently caused by 
    the visor arm lower closing plate during opening/closing of the visor. This 
    indicates that the visor was too low in the hinges, a consequence of the burnt 
    out hinge plates. - See Chapter 30.</font></p>

    above is a view into the opening in the front bulkhead recess inside of which 
    the port ramp hook should have engaged the mating lug at the ramp during the 
    closing procedure which it evidently did not do during the last voyage. This 
    has already been explained under P 3 - Port Forecastle deck.</font></font></p>

    the above image points to a wire running across the front bulkhead and the 
    bow ramp to the starboard side and apparently from the port fair leads of 
    the forecastle deck (there is no other possibility where a wire could come 
    from). The image was made from the video tape produced by ROV on 02.10.94<br>
    - see Subchapter 25.1 - because on subsequent videos the wire is no more visible.</font></font></p>

    above was taken from diver video B40c and is a close up of the same damage 
    area. It shows that the rubber packing including flat bar channel has been 
    pressed flat on a distance of about 200 mm. This could have been caused by 
    a single wire or wire running from the bow ramp around the edge of bulkhead/hull 
    plating up to the fair leads on the forecastle deck and further to one of 
    the winches. Alternatively the damage could have been caused by the port aft 
    edge of the visor bottom in the final stage of the visor separating from the 
    vessel - see Chapter 31 - or it could have been an old damage because the 
    corresponding area on the aft bulkhead of the visor does not show rubbing 
    marks from the rubber packing. See the picture on the next page. A similar 
    damage does not exist at the starboard front bulkhead.</font></font></p>
