  The ROV Inspection on 02.10.94</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As soon as the weather 
    permitted Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) equipped with video cameras were 
    sent down to the wreck on 02.10.94 and produced remarkably sharp pictures, 
    which showed, among other things, that the visor was missing and that its 
    hinges and locking devices were broken. Apparently two ROVs were used which 
    were given the names <i>"Jutta"</i> and <i>"Siimo"</i> and which produced 
    an unknown number of video films of which three films are available. These 
    are:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> video 1 (Jutta 
      2) 02.10.94 1 hour 9 min.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">video 2 (Jutta 
      1) 02.10.94 3 hours 4 min. 28 sec. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">video 4 (Siimo 
      1) 02.10.94 2 hours 56 min. 40 sec. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Copies of these three 
    videos were handed over to this 'Group of Experts' in March 1995 by the Finnish 
    part of the JAIC as "raw material". This turned out to be untrue, because 
    relevant parts, e.g. showing the starboard hull and unknown objects on the 
    bottom of the sea, had been cut out. Therefore a professional examination 
    of the video films by experts has been conducted and revealed that the films 
    have been cut frequently, mostly up to 3 minutes, sometimes up to 17 minutes. 
    The cuts deleted footage taken when the ROVs were inspecting parts of the 
    wreck and also debris on the sea bottom. Consequently it has to be assumed 
    that the most interesting parts permitting conclusions have been cut out of 
    the "raw" material. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The results of the 
    professional examination of all available video films are outlined in Subchapter 
    34.6 - <i>"Investigation Report of Video Tapes featuring the Car/Passenger 
    Ferry "Estonia"</i> by Disengage/UK. They indicate among other things that 
    there were other activities around the wreck in progress.</font></p>

    </font></b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3">The 
    ROV Inspection on 05.10.94</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On 05.10.94 the 
    Finnish vessel TURSAS and the Estonian vessel EVA-200 allegedly started the 
    search for the visor and according to the book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook" 
    </i>by Andi Meister the video films showed the various parts on the sea bottom 
    which had fallen off the ESTONIA as she was drifting towards her sinking position 
    and possibly also already before.<br>

    films are not available. Reference is made to the explanation in Chapter 24 
    and the relevant enclosures. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 09.10.94 and 10.10.94 
    the ROVs were sent down again to film particular parts of the wreck more in 
    detail, but also the sea bottom. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The result 
    - as far as it is known - was video film III - 4 hours 5 minutes long - and 
    the detailed examination by the video experts has revealed that also this 
    "raw" material has been cut in four places, viz.</font></p>

  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It 
    has to be assumed that the parts showing the visor were cut out. Nevertheless 
    video III is the most productive of all videos made by ROVs as will be shown 
    later.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is, however, 
    most interesting to note that in particular all footage of the area of the 
    starboard hull in way of 0-deck, approximately between frames 80-120, has 
    been deleted from all the available videos.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Otherwise the 
    films show pictures of high quality which are of great value for the investigation. 
    As not all the locations of relevance were accessible for ROVs it was decided 
    therefore - and for other reasons - to have the wreck examined by divers and 
    again filmed by ROVs between 1st and 4th December 1994 (see Chapter 27). </font></div>
