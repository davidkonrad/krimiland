      that the flaps in front of the car deck, which close the gap between bow 
      ramp and car deck when the ramp is open, were missing at port side when 
      the ramp was closed. The flaps were then lying loose at the side. After 
      the bow ramp was open I have seen crew members pulling the flaps across 
      the gap by means of hooks. I have sometimes noted that some of the upper 
      flaps of the bow ramp were missing, but were back in place later. <br>

      was always a garbage container standing in front of the centre casing which

      I have been on the car deck at sea several times. The car deck doors were 
      never locked, but I was chased away by crew members sometimes, i.e. I was 
      not permitted to enter the car deck where some activities were going on 
      which I could not identify.<br>
      Trucks and personal cars were never secured, only the trailers were lashed.«</font></i></p>

        sitting in my car in a position close behind the bow ramp waiting for 
        the ramp to open, I remember having frequently seen crew members pulling 
        steel plates across the gap between the open bow ramp and the car deck. 
        I know that this gap is normally closed by steel flaps, but these had 
        been dismounted with certainty at the port side. There were now holes 
        in the flaps on both ends into which crew members were putting hooks by 
        means of which they were pulling the flaps across the gap when the ramp 
        was open and to the side before the ramp was closed.<br>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The car deck 
      doors were not locked at sea (although it was said by the crew that they 
      were), thus I was able to go down on to the car deck at sea, also at night 
      (although this was strictly forbidden). I did this frequently to take something 
      to my car, or to take something out, or just to check the car in bad weather 
      to make sure that nothing was touching it. The car was sometimes secured 
      by wooden wedges being put in front and behind the wheels, the trucks were 
      sometimes secured by belts, the trailers very often not at all.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In 
      front of the centre casing there were always standing one or two garbage 
      containers into which the crew put empty bottles, cartons and the like. 
      In addition, I noticed that these containers were also sometimes standing 
      at port side and at starboard side in the aft part of the car deck. I have 
      drawn the position into a sketch of the car deck (attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.5.163.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      12.4.5.163</a>). As far as I remember these containers were never secured 
      and very often caused concern to me when my car was standing close to them. 
      The port one is visible on picture 1, whereby arrow 2 is pointing to it.</font></i></p>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>When I was 
      down on the car deck at night, I have several times seen the flashing light 
      of welding being performed in the forward part of the car deck near or at 
      the bow ramp. When I was standing with my car close behind the bow ramp 
      I could look into the open control panel located at the port side inner 
      bulkhead behind the bow ramp. I remember that at least during the last months 
      before the catastrophe there were only 1 (one) green and 1 (one) red light 
      visible on the panel. The operator was always an ordinary crew member with 
      boiler suit and walkie-talkie.«</i></font></p>

    not make sense to him unless they needed wood in Tallinn, e.g. to support

        for the long trucks to make the turn in Stockholm, thus the crew opened 
        the visor and lowered down the bow ramp on to which the long trucks then 
        drove backwards in order to be able to make the turn.<br>
