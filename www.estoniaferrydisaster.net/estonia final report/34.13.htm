  on the JAIC Report <br>
  by Prof. Dr.-Ing. H. Petershagen, Hamburg </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The JAIC Report has been analysed 
  from the naval architects point of view and the resulting comments are completely 
  incorporated into PART C. The conclusions of Professor Petershagen read as follows: 
  "The sections of the final report of the Joint Accident Investigation Commission 
  commented in this contribution are based on a number of individual investigations. 
  Most of these are carried out according to the present state of knowledge and 
  analysis methods. However, the results involve large uncertainties, especially 
  with regard to the loads on the bow visor at the time of the accident. Moreover, 
  the report contains misinterpretations and neglects possible influence factors 
  on the visor failure such as maintenance conditions of the structures in question 
  and pre-existing damage. Summarizing it has to be stated that the parts of the 
  final report commented do not offer a reliable basis for a realistic assessment 
  of the bow visor failure of MV "ESTONIA".</font></p>
