  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In this chapter 
    the reader is introduced to the condition of the wreck as concluded from the 
    reports of the divers (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.409.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    27.409</a> and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm">27.410</a>) and 
    from the different videos available to this 'Group of Experts'. </font></font></p>

  The General Condition</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">This can best 
    be explained by the Smit Tak Survey Report of December 1994 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.410</a> - where it is stated:</font></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The wreck 
      of the ESTONIA lies on her starboard side in a direction 095°/097° true, 
      which consequently means her decks are facing south. In longitudinal direction 
      there is little to no heel. Both rudders are clear and do have an angle 
      of 35 degrees to starboard. Both propellers and propeller shafts are clear. 
      Starboard bilge is clear from the seabed and the deck side is partly buried 
      in the mud. Liferafts have not been noticed in the racks and since none 
      are floating on lines between the ship and the surface it is assumed that 
      all have been released. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
      port side some lifeboats are still hanging in or attached to the davits, 
      a condition which could not be established on the starboard side because 
      of the aforementioned list. The port side anchor was reported to be in the 
      hawse pipe, starboard side has not been seen but is assumed to be in the 
      hawse pipe as well.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The visor was missing 
    with the remains of the hinges on the forecastle deck broken, both front bulkheads 
    and the bow ramp were noted to be severely damaged, damaged/broken railings 
    and broken davits were found in way of deck 7 and some broken windows/port 
    holes on other decks. <br>
    Window panels were found to have been pushed out and doors in the aft bulkheads 
    of decks 5 and 7 were missing while<b> the door in the front bulkhead of deck 
    5 leading down to the forecastle deck was noted to be open.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    door could only be opened by crew members. The aft parts of the superstructures 
    in way of decks 7 and 8 on the port side were found to be partly distorted 
    and buckled. Large flakes of paint were scored off the aft parts of decks 
    5 and 6 - see the two images below - which was most probably caused when the 
    vessel was in upside down condition with the stern already aground and the 
    bow still above the water. - See the drawing below.</font></p>
