  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">THE YEAR 1997 </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC finally managed 
    to complete their Report and publish the English version together with 2 Supplements 
    on 3 December while the Swedish version took another year. Before the publication, 
    however, many things happened which shall be explained in the following Subchapters. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.1 <br>
    The Development until May 1997 </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">January: Due to the illness 
    of Börje Stenström the position of the technical head of the JAIC was apparently 
    taken over by Tuomo Karppinen assisted by Mikael Huss and Klaus Rahka. Karppinen 
    phoned on 17 January and reported the following: <br>
    - They are still making small changes to the report. They had the lugs of 
    the Atlantic lock at VTT and have analysed the paint layers. They found some 
    7-8, grey, white, red, blue paint and are certain now that the lugs were on 
    board for quite some time.<br>
    - They have also spoken to the Turku yard, who stated, never to have painted 
    the forepeak deck area, thus it must have been the crew.<br>
    - Have told him about the change of shape and he said the lugs from board 
    have the same shape as the von Tell drawing and as the mock-up during the 
    break tests, which is correct except that the aft part is vertically cut off. 
    <br>
    - He is unable to give an estimate when their report might be completed, a 
    lot depends on the meeting next week. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC met in Helsinki 
    on 24/25 January and continued to discuss the final version of the Report. 
    The protocol of the previous meeting on 16/17 December in Pårnu was distributed. 
    It reveals that Kari Lethola had spoken to Edelmann/F.B.N. who had told him 
    that there were two persons in the administration, who knew that there was 
    a "problem" with accepting the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead, but that it was common practice to do so. <br>
    This protocol further reveals that Tuomo Karppinen had contact to a Mr. Mäkälainen, 
    who had stated that locking devices had been changed and that Uno Laur had 
    demanded a written statement from this man. The person is unknown to this 
    'Group of Experts' and nothing about him is mentioned in the JAIC Report. 
    This and other protocols finally reveal, that the Sjöfartsverket "observer" 
    Sten Andersson actively participated in the drafting of the Final Report. 
    He was obviously treated as a commission member and apparently did behave 
    like that. Enn Neidre participated also. <br>
    From one of the relative organisations the information was received that the 
    handling of the ESTONIA case by the Swedish Government had been moved away 
    from the Ministry for Communication and Transport (Minister Inez Uzman) to 
    the Ministry of Defence - "Department for Psychological Defence".</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> February: The JAIC met again 
    in Helsinki on 19/20 February. The discussion of the chapters of the final 
    Report was continued and Enn Neidre attended again. On 21 February Tuomo Karppinen 
    phoned again and reported about the results of the meeting:<br>
    - In principle they do agree on the contents of all the chapters - they however 
    have to be proof-read. <br>
    - But they did not agree on the conclusions and recommendations. Therefore 
    they will meet again on 12 March and remain together until everything is agreed. 
    <br>
    - The conclusion will be that one wave impact broke the visor at 01.00 hours. 
    <br>
    - All attachments including the hinges broke a few minutes after 01.00 hours. 
    <br>
    - The first water on the car deck was at 01.10.12. <br>
    - Then it took about 10 minutes for the visor to cut through the deck beams 
    and then the ramp was pulled open.<br>
    - 01.20/22 the main engines stopped, vessel started to drift, starboard side 
    to the wind. <br>
    - Only two passengers have reported water in the 1st deck. <br>
    Note: Actually 9 survivors reported water on the 1st deck, of which two already 
    before the big heel.<br>
    - At 01.30 hours ESTONIA was on the side. <br>
    On 25 February Klaus Rahka reported the following: <br>
    - He wanted the report from the Institute for all the break tests performed 
    (was sent to him). <br>
    - He promised to send a copy of the final findings (which he never did). <br>
    - They ignored the passenger video - see <a href="chapter39.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    39.3</a> - because the pictures are jumping too much. It was explained to 
    him that the pictures did not jump on the copy which was jointly viewed in 
    Helsinki, but he was not interested. His attention was drawn to the fact that 
    the starboard hinge bolt was standing without bushing on the rail, which confirmed 
    that the bushing cannot have been complete as otherwise it couldn't have fallen 
    off the bolt and would have remained attached to the bolt as evidently the 
    point bushing did. He was not interested, the decision had already been made 
    jointly. <br>
    - They had come to the conclusion that the load on the visor was about 60 
    ts which was sufficient to break all the locks. <br>
    - He believes that the welding seams of the 1st mock-up had been 5 mm instead 
    of 3 mm. <br>
    - Börje Stenström had now officially resigned from the case. Note: Börje Stenström 
    passed away on 25 February.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> March: On 5 March Tuomo 
    Karppinen faxed page 13 of the Draft Report and requested details about the 
    communication between the yard/ BV/ von Tell, etc. which was complied with 
    by sending the respective chapter of the Report of this 'Group of Experts'. 
    From 12-16 March the JAIC met again to finalize the Report which failed, although 
    - as stated above - it had been the intention to stay together until the last 
    disputes were solved. On 17 March "DAGENS NYHETER" as well as "SVENSKA DAGBLADET" 
    published articles about the internal disputes in the JAIC between Estonia 
    on the one side and Sweden/Finland on the other concerning the behaviour of 
    the crew, respectively how much blame was to be put on the crew. Furthermore, 
    the attention of the public was drawn to the letter Stenström wrote at the 
    beginning of December 1996 to Dr. Holtappels indicating that the JAIC would 
    not point to Meyer Werft having installed the faulty locks by not excluding 
    that the installations could have been changed after the vessel had left the 
    yard. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">April: At the beginning of 
    this month the stowage plan showing the reconstruction of the condition on 
    the car deck according to the cargo manifest was sent from Hamburg to Helsinki. 
    In exchange, a copy of the KTH-Report about the examination of the hinge material 
    was received.<br>
    During the second half of this month a contact to the Turku Repair Yard was 
    established which resulted after some time in the receipt of very valuable 
    documentation, i.e. the repair-specifications, -quotations and invoices concern-ing 
    the time before, during and after the take-over of the ferry by N&T - see 
    <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.4.</a><br>
    Tuomo Karppinen phoned on 23 April and requested help with regard to <br>
    - the memo on magnetic limit switches (made up by the Estonian JAIC - see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.5.172</a>); <br>
    - type of these switches, names/telephone numbers of the electricians having 
    installed them; <br>
    all of which was sent to him. <br>
    In exchange he sent the Leif Bogren and the Hangö statements, which were received 
    the following day. <br>
    He reported further that proof-reading and lay-out of the Report would not 
    be completed before the end of May, i.e. the Report might be printed before 
    midsummer, thus could be published just before the vacation season begins, 
    which the JAIC would prefer. <br>
    At a meeting on 18 April with the Stockholm public relations company H&H the 
    idea was developed to present the findings of this 'Group of Experts' to the 
    Swedish public at an exhibition in Stockholm at the same time when the Report 
    of the JAIC was presented and the media and the public could come to the exhibition 
    and check, compare and discuss the results. This was decided during the following 
    days and the time was set for the week before midsummer, which left two months 
    for preparations.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> May: Tuomo Karppinen phoned 
    on 6 May and stated that <br>
    - they were still proof-reading;<br>
    - they had planned some sort of seminar under the chairmanship of Prof. Rutgersson 
    from KTH in Stockholm where they wanted to present their technical findings 
    to raise the profile of the JAIC, however this can, of course, only be done 
    after the publication of their final report, which will probably be during 
    the week before midsummer. <br>
    On 16 May Karppinen phoned again and told that they were making good progress, 
    about half of the Report was already in the printing house in Helsinki. The 
    day before they had gone through part of the Report with their English language 
    expert. It is most unlikely that they will attend the seminar. It is still 
    under consideration between Kari Lethola, Uno Laur and Olof Forssberg whether 
    this 'Group of Experts' will get the part of their Report dealing with Meyer 
    Werft matters.<br>
    On 20 May journalist Anders Hellberg from DAGENS NYHETER reported that the 
    seminar had been postponed. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>40.1.1 
    <br>
    The Dismissal of Olof Forssberg</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On 26 May the interview 
    quote below by radio journalist Erik Ridderstolpe with Olof Forssberg was 
    broadcasted in Swedish Radio:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Journalist (J), Olof Forssberg 
    (OF)<br>
    "Speaker: The Swedish chairman of the JAIC has lied about a letter concerning 
    important facts about why Estonia and other vessels were built in an incorrect 
    way. Despite the fact that Olof Forssberg has been assigned by the government 
    to lead the commission's work in trying to establish the truth behind the 
    sinking of Estonia, he has repeatedly lied.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> J: So you have never seen 
    this letter?<br>
    OF: No. <br>
    J: Never at all?<br>
    OF: No. It must have been delivered faulty. I will receive a new copy on Monday 
    ... It wasn't today's mail.<br>
    J: Isn't that strange since the letter was sent to you a long time ago. <br>
    OF: These things happen. The post is not always reliable. <br>
    J: So you haven't seen what this letter contains at all? <br>
    OF: No. <br>
    Speaker </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Olof Forssberg 
    is chairman of the JAIC. He is the one responsible for establishing the truth 
    behind the catastrophe. He has already been heavily criticised for his way 
    of handling the investigation. This time the issue is sensitive information 
    about the Sjöfartsverket. It is information that shows that Sjöfartsverket 
    for many years didn't control the placement of the very important collision 
    bulkhead that shall prevent water from entering the car deck in an emergency 
    situation. If Estonia's collision bulkhead had been placed in the right position, 
    the vessel would never have sunk. Olof Forssberg has received and read the 
    letter, but had not registered it. He has deliberately or non-deliberately 
    misplaced the letter. At least one other occasion he has denied that he has 
    received the letter, and he has asked the sender to sent the letter again 
    just so that it would seem as if he had never received it. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">J: But I just can't understand 
    why you are lying?<br>
    OF: I can't understand it either and I must say that I am ashamed over having 
    lied. I have no explanation. I regret that I have been handling the truth 
    carelessly. The reason I have asked you to come here today is partly that 
    I want to explain that I have been lying and also apologise to you.<br>
    J: Is this common behaviour for the chairman of the JAIC?<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> OF: Absolutely not. 
    It goes without saying that the answer to that question is no. <br>
    J: Is this the way you normally handle documents? <br>
    OF: Absolutely not. I always register documents very carefully. Actually I 
    think that the reason for this omission, or rather consequence of, was the 
    fact that the person who handles the Estonia file was on vacation.<br>
    J: How do you think this affects the credibility of the JAIC?<br>
    OF: This is what concerns me most. There have been a few occasions where I 
    not even today can understand why I have acted with such a lack of judgement 
    in certain situations. <br>
    J: The motive behind this is still not quite clear. Why did you lie about 
    the letter? <br>
    OF: ..I...the..hm..I don't think that the motive is unclear. Quite simply 
    this document was received or I read it through and I put it somewhere and 
    then I didn't think anymore about it. <br>
    J: But it is one thing to do that, and quite another to deny the existence 
    of the document. And also you don't have the document here in your office. 
    <br>
    OF: ...n..ne...I...I don't know where it is right now, the letter has now 
    been miscarried but that is not a problem since I have asked the sender to 
    send the same letter once more.<br>
    J. That you did in order to look good and so that you could say that you had 
    now received the letter. <br>
    OF: I have now explained the whole situation to you and I think that, well, 
    that things are as they are." </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The subject of the discussion 
    which subsequently turned out to be the reason for the dismissal of Olof Forssberg 
    by Minister Inez Uzman is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.2.3.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.2.3</a>. It is a letter concerning a directors' meeting at Sjöfartsverket 
    dated 07.04.59. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 28 May Tuomo Karppinen 
    phoned and reported the following: <br>
    - Ridderstolpe from Swedish Radio had phoned Forssberg and asked whether he 
    had received a paper from 1959, of which he, Karppinen, also has a copy. Forssberg's 
    answer was no, although he knew that he had the copy but could not find it. 
    He asked Sjöfartsverket to send the letter again which was, however, delayed. 
    So he told Ridderstolpe that he did not have it and never saw it and was subsequently 
    proven to have lied. The first letter was not registered because it was considered 
    unimportant. Ridderstolpe got a tip from somebody inside Sjöfartsverket.<br>
    - General Director of "Statens Havarie Kommission" (SHK) is a full time job. 
    In case the Government should decide to put an outsider in this position, 
    it will take several months and will cause further delay to the publication 
    of the Report. Therefore it has to be assumed that it will be somebody from 
    the Government administration.<br>
    - He has sent two more Chapters to the printing house. <br>
    - They are still of the opinion that it all started with the failure of the 
    visor locking devices on course 287° and full speed, but some within the JAIC 
    believe that it started with the hinges.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Olof Forssberg was dismissed 
    from his position as Chairman of the JAIC on 27 May and replaced by Ann-Louise 
    Eksborg on 16 June. The lady had been working in the legal department of the 
    Ministry of Defence before. Also on the same day Captain Olle Noord, nautical 
    expert up to that time, was appointed member in replacement of Börje Stenström, 
    i.e. now two master mariners were members (Rosengren and Noord). Naval architects 
    were no more present in the JAIC, which, however, did not mean that more emphasis 
    was put on the up to then widely neglected nautical aspects of the case. Olof 
    Forssberg attended for the last time at a working meeting of the Swedish part 
    of the JAIC on 4 June. <br>
    Note: Olof Forssberg was very soon appointed an appeal court judge. One wonders. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b><a name="2"></a>40.2<br>
    The First Exhibition in Stockholm </b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">40.2.1<br>
    Preparations </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The investigation events 
    were summarized in a brochure in English and Swedish languages - the English 
    version is attached as Enclosure 40.2 - which were distributed to the visitors. 
    In further preparation, two exhibition guides were acquainted with the investigation 
    results, these were <br>
    - from Sweden, Captain Erland von Hofsten, 68 years old, retired Stena Line 
    captain and Chairman of the Swedish Sailors Foundation, and <br>
    - from Finland, Captain Peter Jansson, 53 years old, maritime consultant and 
    owner of Oy Mariners Assistance, Porvoo. <br>
    Both spent one week in Hamburg, read through the material, viewed the videos 
    and discussed open questions with this 'Group of Experts'. <br>
    For the exhibition the history of the vessel from newbuilding to sinking was 
    illustrated on big paper sheets. In addition, the topics of the investigation, 
    e.g. the passenger video, the condition of the visor hinges, etc. were illustrated 
    on separate sheets. Furthermore, one of the mock-ups of the Atlantic locks, 
    broken at the break test, a model of the "VIKING SALLY", models of intact 
    and damaged visor hinges, the hinge mock-up with the burning test, numerous 
    drawings and other documentations of interest were shown at the exhibition 
    which took place in the "Gamla Spårvägshallarna" on Birger Jarlsgatan in the 
    centre of Stockholm. <br>
    While the preparations were in progress the chairman of the Swedish JAIC, 
    Olof Forssberg, was dismissed, which triggered off a wave of speculations 
    and, last but not least, caused a new delay of the publication of the JAIC 
    Report. After careful consideration of all circumstances it was decided to 
    continue with the preparations and to open the exhibition - as planned - on 
    Thursday, 12 June, because it was possible by this exhibition to fill the 
    gap which had doubtlessly been created by the new postponement of the publication 
    of the JAIC Report. </font></p>

    <br>
    The Exhibition</b> </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Exhibition was opened 
    on 12 June at 10.00 hours with a presentation for invited guests. Invitations 
    had been sent to the JAIC chairman, members of the Government and of Parliament. 
    About 30 persons of the invited persons appeared, among others: <br>
    - Lennart Berglund/Odd Lundqvist - SEA Relative Organisation <br>
    - Gunnar Benndreus/Henning Witte/Alve Wendt - DIS Relative Organisation<br>
    - Prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand <br>
    - Sjöfartsverket Director Johann Fransson<br>
    - Jörgen Almelöv - Lawyer of N&T <br>
    - Carl Romare - Skuld / Stockholm <br>
    - Lawyers from Skuld / Estline / ESCO <br>
    - one representative of Trygg Hansa - the leading Hull Underwriters of "ESTONIA" 
    <br>
    - Pierre Frey of Bureau Veritas/Paris <br>
    - Bureau Veritas Stockholm - Lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnsson.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> No one from the JAIC, the 
    Government or the Parliament appeared. <br>
    About 50 journalists attended the following press conference. They came mainly 
    from Sweden, but also from Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Germany. 
    Various TV and radio programs were present with own teams and a considerable 
    number of interviews were made. On the next morning, however, there were only 
    small articles in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and TT NEWS, while TV 1 and TV 4 mentioned 
    the exhibition briefly in their evening news. The question arose why the Swedish 
    media were suddenly so disinterested. Nevertheless the Swedish public, informed 
    about the exhibition by various advertisements, had a different opinion and 
    visited the exhibition in daily growing members while the media remained silent. 
    Only in DAGENS NYHETER on the "Debate" page did one letter from the N&T lawyer, 
    Jörgen Almelöv, appear, which was written in response to the letter of Dr. 
    Holtappels having been published on the same page the day before the exhibition 
    was opened. Among the daily increasing number of visitors were retired captains, 
    pilots, professors from the Royal Technical High Schools in Stockholm and 
    Gothenburg, but also relatives, survivors and previous passengers. Even the 
    master, the chief mate and the chief engineer from "REGINA BALTICA", the ferry 
    having replaced the ESTONIA, visited the exhibition twice and took information 
    material with them. <br>
    The Finnish JAIC chairman Kari Lethola came with two assistants and stayed 
    for 11/2 hours, the investigating public prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand came 
    twice with criminal inspector Bo Wide. Both stayed for several hours. Also 
    several employees of Sjöfartsverket appeared and very interesting discussions 
    took place. Most important were the many statements taken from previous passengers, 
    in particular truck drivers, which provided new and more detailed evidence 
    about the disastrous condition of visor and bow ramp including hinges and 
    locking devices, all of which were incorporated into the report of this 'Group 
    of Experts'. See Subchapters <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3 /</a> 
    <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br>
    On the last day the relatives organisation DIS held their press conference 
    inside the exhibition to demonstrate their appreciation for the work of this 
    'Group of Experts' and its preparedness to show the results in Stockholm. 
    <br>
    At the exit of the exhibition a black book had been waiting for entries by 
    visitors about their impressions and feelings after having seen the exhibition 
    and the result was overwhelming as demonstrated by the Swedish original and 
    the English translation attached as Enclosures <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480</a> 
    / <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/40.2.480.1a.htm" target="_blank">40.2.480.1.</a> 
    <br>
    On Thursday, 19 June, the day before the Midsummer celebrations would commence, 
    the exhibition was closed after having been open for 7 full days, during which 
    approximately 1200 visitors saw the exhibition.<br>
    In summary it has to be concluded that the exhibition had been a great success, 
    in spite of the silence of the media. The visitors appreciated the opportunity 
    to study the history of the vessel from design/construction to the sinking, 
    the many photos, drawings, the models and mock-up, all of which was explained 
    to them, if they wished so. Many regretted what they thought was a too early 
    closing, however, accepted the reasons, viz. that it would make little sense 
    to kept he exhibition open through Midsummer. Many visitors urged the exhibition 
    guides to request Mr. Bernard Meyer urgently to make sure that the exhibition 
    would be made available again to the Swedish public once the JAIC would finally 
    publish their report. Many visitors demanded a new diving investigation to 
    establish the real truth of the catastrophe. <br>
    It became obvious that the Swedish public and in particular the relatives 
    did realize that this 'Group of Experts' - contrary to all publications and 
    assumptions - really had done their utmost to uncover the real facts and circumstances 
    having led to the catastrophe, and still continues to do so as demonstrated 
    at the exhibition. The message from many relatives and survivors, that it 
    is of utmost importance to them to know, what really happened, was understood 
    and, also, that they felt to be left absolutely alone by their authorities. 
    <br>
    Furthermore, it was realised and accepted that there was serious and convincing 
    evidence available indicating a much better and more logical casualty scenario 
    than that published so far by the JAIC. <br>
    The visitors also understood that a substantial part of the responsibility 
    for the catastrophe was resting with their own Sjöfartsverket and many did 
    express their deep concern about it. The recent resignation of the Swedish 
    JAIC chairman Olof Forssberg in this connection did increase the ill feelings 
    of many visitors.<br>
    Basically it became clear to most visitors that the main blame was resting 
    with the technical managers and part owners N&T, the crew managers and part 
    owners ESCO and the classification society Bureau Veritas. Many visitors were 
    shocked that the ferry in such condition could depart every 2nd day from a 
    Swedish port with 1000 or more Swedes onboard, without any Swedish authority 
    doing anything to prevent it. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The Swedish Government, when 
    faced with the facts shown at the exhibition, reacted as follows: <br>
    - The responsible Minister of Communication, Inez Uzman, remained silent and 
    did not attend. <br>
    - The same refers to the members of the Swedish JAIC (only the expert Mikael 
    Huss visited the exhibition in his own time). <br>
