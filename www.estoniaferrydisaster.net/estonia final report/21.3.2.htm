  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Ca. 23.45 hours 
    (Swedish time) = 00.45 hours ship's time a dull bang and ca. 1/2 minute later 
    a similar bang were heard, these were really sharp and short sounds which 
    were clearly heard despite the music, the vessel was shaking somewhat, the 
    noises were not created by waves striking against the bow; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) after a while 
    there was an enormous crash and the whole vessel was shaking / vibrating; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) 23.45/50 hours 
    (Swedish time) 3 metal to metal bangs with 15-20 seconds in-between were heard

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) got lost and 
    ended up on the 2nd car deck, where a CRASH was heard (probably the same as 
    under (2); </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) time before the 
    vessel fell on the side it was felt that the vessel's whole construction was 
    suddenly shaking (probably the same as under (2); </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) unusual shaking/vibrating 
    of the vessel's hull were felt, these shocks were really shaking the vessel 
    and the truck drivers felt uneasy wondering whether the trucks were really 
    secured.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    above item a.) it has to be concluded that the survivors from the 4th deck 
    heard and felt at about 00.45 hours a dull bang and 30 seconds later another 
    similar dull bang. These were sharp and short sounds. A moment later there 
    was an enormous crash and the vessel's structure was shaking/ vibrating. Again 
    a little later there were 3 metallic bangs after which the vessel was shaking/vibrating 
    differently than before. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) It was noted 
    after a while that the engine noises became different and that the vessel's 
    speed might have been reduced;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) a little later 
    a deep/slow pitch movement and vibrations in the aftship like from astern-pitch 
    and/or stern turned into the wind were realised - glasses were clinking;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) shortly before 
    the list started the vessel began to roll equally in the waves from side to 
    side and it felt as if the vessel did not have the sea from ahead. At that 
    time the engines were not felt;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (4) there was uncertainty 
    whether the vessel was proceeding ahead or was lying still (did not move). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary of the 
    above item b.) it has to be concluded that at some short time after the noise 
    scenario summarised under item a.) the engines/pitch were reduced and/or put 
    to 0 and/or to astern. It has further to be concluded that the course was 
    changed to port or to starboard to the effect that wind/waves came either 
    from port or starboard and caused the vessel to roll.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) at 01.00 hours

    has to be concluded that doubtless there were movements of cars and in all 
    probability also of trucks. The inside of the bow ramp shows damage from inside 
    to outside which could have been caused by a truck. On the other hand what 
    many explained as "movements" on the car deck could also have been the scraping

    a very low noise was heard and the pitch movements stopped, thereafter pitching 
    and rolling and then only rolling - 2 full swings, i.e. less to port/more 
    to starboard; at the 3rd swing the vessel heeled deep to starboard, righted 
    almost and then fell abruptly to ca. 15°, this was just before 01.00 hours;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) other survivors 
    identified the bangs to be more like 3 scraping noises which followed one 
    straight after the other with some seconds in between and after these scraping 
    noises the vessel took the severe heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) the heel caused 
    the alarm clock to fall from the table, the batteries became dislodged and

    has to be considered the exact time of the big heel; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) in a starboard 
    forward cabin a rushing noise was heard from below after the bangs but before 
    the big heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (5) another survivor 
    reported that 3 "bangs" were heard one after the other; between the first

    came from port side. Shortly afterwards the ferry heeled to starboard side
