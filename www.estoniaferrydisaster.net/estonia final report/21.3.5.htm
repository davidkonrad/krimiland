    accommodation deck for the crew with four cabins in front of the superstructure, 
    cabins on each side up to the stern, and officers' and crew's messrooms with 
    pantries in the aft part. The four forward cabins were used as follows (from 
    starboard to port):</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1st cabin : economy 
      superintendent Jan Bergendahl (()<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The windows of these 
    cabins overlooked the foreship and it can reasonably be assumed that the chief 
    officer and the 1st engineer did look out of their windows when hearing the 
    crashing and/or banging noises from the bow area, which alarmed so many persons.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Whilst Jan 
    Bergendahl is not mentioned in any of the statements available to this 'Group 
    of Experts', the voice of chief officer Juhan Herma has been identified with 
    a high degree of probability in the Distress Communication through his shouting 
    of the position to Andres Tammes - see Subchapter 22.1 - thus during the final 
    stage he was on the bridge. According to the statements of 2nd engineer Peeter 
    Tüür and reefer engineer Andres Verro they had met 1st engineer Arvo Tulvik 
    shortly after the big starboard heel in the alleyway in front of their cabin 
    doors. <br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>In summary of

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The time and noise 
    scenarios are basically in agreement with the observations from the other 
    decks, although it has to be borne in mind that only the crew members were 
    accommodated on deck 7 and their statements have to be considered with particular 
    care.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This refers also 
    to the statement of 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür who has testified in his second 
    statement taken on 29.09.94 by the criminal police Tallinn - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/7.3.2.128.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    7.3.2.128</a> - that he met the 1st engineer Arvo Tulvik (() in front of his 
    cabin door, who then said: "Apparently the visor broke up, would be good if 
    the vessel would be taken ashore." In his first statement taken by the Finnish 
    police on 28 September 1994, while he was still on board the ISABELLA (the 
    ferry that rescued him), he specifically said that he had not discussed anything 
    with Arvo Tulvik. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The observations 
    of Elmar Siegel that the man overboard boat (lifeboat No. 1) proceeded away 
    from the vessel without caring for the people in the water and which is confirmed 
    by the surviving passenger Thure Palmgren is of considerable importance, although 
    the consequences cannot be overlooked.</font></li>
