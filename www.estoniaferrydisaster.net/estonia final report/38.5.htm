  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>38.5 Further<br>
    Investigations and Meetings </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">At the beginning of September 
    6 Finnish statements of the key witnesses of the crew and the statement taken 
    in Hangö from the nautical student Rain Oolmets were received from the Finnish 
    JAIC. Almost one year after the casualty had passed before the first statements 
    could be studied and evaluated by this 'Group of Experts'! <br>
    In the meantime Stenström continued to give interviews in support of the JAIC 
    scenario and cause consideration and, in particular, drew the attention of 
    the media to the poor condition of part of the visor hinges and the locking 
    devices for which, in his view, the building yard was to be blamed with the 
    naïve argument that the JAIC was unable to find anybody who would admit to 
    have done repairs as sloppy as described during the lifetime of the vessel, 
    or that they could not find any recording on them.<br>
    Nevertheless the communication between Stenström and this 'Group of Experts' 
    was continued. <br>
    At a further meeting in Stockholm on 2 October Stenström reported that the 
    next JAIC meeting would be on 17/18 October in Tallinn. At the subsequent 
    meeting in Stockholm on 5 December, the technical part written by him - see 
    the Part-Report - would be finally agreed upon. The JAIC's scenario and cause 
    considerations would not be changed. Nevertheless, he agreed to have a look 
    at the facts considered by this 'Group of Experts' not to be in dispute and, 
    further, to another meeting to be held in Stockholm during the first week 
    in November. Stenström also reported that the tank tests with a model of the 
    ESTONIA had shown that at a speed of 10 kn the same loads on the visor occurred 
    as at a speed of 14.5 kn, however not as often. <br>
    Stenström furthermore admitted that up to 30 ts. water could have been in 
    the visor. <br>
    Note: This was not surprising because this is the quantity indicated by the 
    highest water mark visible inside the visor. <br>
    This means that the lower part of the bow ramp including the hinges had been 
    under water. Stenström further stated that the heavy damage to the port outer 
    ramp hinge - as visible on the videos - had existed already since some time 
    before the casualty. As a result - in his opinion - the bow ramp could not 
    be closed properly at the port lower edge, thus was open to the visor up to 
    about 20 mm. This - so he said - was also the reason why the port lower securing 
    bolt of the ramp was unable to engage its mating pocket at the ramp side. 
    He then stated that the Estonian crew had put this severe damage repeatedly 
    on the repair list since some time already, however without N&T doing anything. 
    He said that he had copies of these repair lists. Stenström argued further 
    that because the bow ramp had been partly open for some time already, there 
    must have always been water on the car deck if the theory of the German 'Group 
    of Experts' would be correct. However, as there had obviously not always been 
    water on the car deck the visor could not have been filled to the outside 
    water level. Unfortunately the observations of previous passengers and, in 
    particular, the statement of Pilot Bo Söderman - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a> and <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.4.4</a> 
    - were at that time not yet known to this 'Group of Experts'. They prove beyond 
    reasonable doubt that there had indeed been water on the car deck already 
    in 1993 and the worse the weather got the more water had been on the car deck.<br>
    In any event, Stenström had stated that the bow ramp could no more be properly 
    closed for some time before the casualty, that the crew had demanded repairs 
    which were rejected by N&T. It follows already from this fact that the ferry 
    had been initially unseaworthy with the knowledge of the technical managers 
    and owners since some time before the casualty already. No mention of this 
    serious deficiency is made in the Final Report with the exception of the following 
    remark on page 42 - <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 3.3.6</a> 
    - "It was known that the play in the ramp hinges was approaching the point 
    where corrective action would be needed". <br>
    By letter of 27 October the "the undisputed facts" were submitted by this 
    'Group of Experts' to the JAIC and a copy of the letter is attached as Enclosure 
    38.5. <br>
    Note: The letter was registered on 2 November 1995 under B125 in the logbook 
    of the Swedish JAIC and was declared classified until 9 March 1998. <br>
    This 'Group of Experts' expressed once again its regret that it was not possible 
    for the JAIC to travel to Hamburg and/or Papenburg:<br>
    <i>"Once again we have to express our regret that is has not been possible 
    for you to visit us here in Hamburg and/or in Papenburg. Many things would 
    have been much easier to transfer to you respectively prove to you, if you 
    would have spoken to the individuals personally and asked your own questions, 
    be that now the von Tell representative Todsen, the BV surveyor Lohmann or 
    the welders, locksmiths, foreman, etc. of Meyer Werft having been engaged 
    respectively responsible, e.g. for the welding of bushings into the lugs of 
    the Atlantic lugs or the lugs to A-deck or the steel bushings into the bores 
    of the visor arms etc., all of whom have been identified. Anyway this can 
    still be arranged if you should wish so."" </i><br>
    As there was no response, it was decided to take one of the welders to Stockholm 
    to the next meeting. This was welder Koenen who had welded, among other things, 
    the locking devices in the foreship area of ESTONIA during its construction. 
    <br>
    The next meeting with the JAIC took place in Stockholm on 9/10 November and 
    before the meeting this 'Group of Experts', together with the Meyer Werft 
    welder Koenen, had about two hours time to look - undisturbed and in detail 
    - at the recovered objects stored in the basement of the KTH. The comments 
    of welder Koenen after this close inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs can 
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> "(a) Starboard lug with 
      bracket (Nr. 3)<br>
      - the welding seams at the outer side were made from the upper side to the 
      lower side, when the lug was in erected condition, i.e. welded to A-Deck, 
      be means of a very thin electrode; <br>
      - although if the lug was erected the welding seam should have commenced 
      at the lower side and then gone upwards, which it did not;<br>
      - when the initial welding seam between the lug and the bushing was laid 
      in the workshop the lug was lying flat which creates a totally different 
      welding structure from the one visible at the lug remains; - the bracket 
      is not original for many reasons,</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> i.e. it is longer than 
      the bushing was because both welding seams end already ca. 15 mm before 
      the end of the bracket: </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">the end is cut very roughly 
      - as would never have been done by the yard</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> the welding seams were 
      not made by the yard for the above-mentioned reasons. They are laid very 
      unprofes-sionally and the ends of both welds are not connected at the top 
      of the bracket, i.e. seawater could and obviously had penetrated the welds 
      and seeped underneath the bushing with corrosion following therefrom." </font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This means that the Atlantic 
    lock found was not the original and this was presented in detail to the JAIC 
    at the meeting commencing at 11.00 hours with welder Koenen also in attendance. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The JAIC was represented 
    by the following persons: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström : for Sweden 
      <br>
      Mikael Huss : <br>
      Tuomo Karppinen : for Finland <br>
      Klaus Rahka :<br>
      Prof. Jaan Metsaveer : for Estonia </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">To begin with the findings 
    and conclusion of the inspection of the Atlantic lock lugs were submitted 
    in detail and in summary. It was concluded that the lugs of the Atlantic lock 
    welded to the forepeak deck were no more original. Due to the red paint below 
    the blue it had to be assumed, however, that the lugs had been exchanged already 
    when the vessel was still "VIKING SALLY" which was noted by the JAIC in silence 
    and without further comments.<br>
    Subsequently the participants of the JAIC were invited to ask questions to 
    welder Koenen about the yard practice, welding standards or whatever else, 
    but in particular about their view expressed as in the Part-Report conclusions, 
    namely:<br>
    "<i>- The visor locking devices were constructed with less strength than required 
    according to calculations. It is believed that this discrepancy developed 
    due to lack of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions 
    for certain parts of the devices."</i> Not a single question was, however, 
    put to welder Koenen who left with the impression that none of the experts 
    of the JAIC was the least interested in his testimony. His impression was 
    correct, because the JAIC reiterated in their Final Report what they had assumed 
    to be the facts already in November 1994. <br>
    <i>"The attachments were constructed with less strength than the simplistic 
    calculations required. It is believed that this discrepancy was due to lack 
    of sufficiently detailed manufacturing and installation instructions for certain 
    parts of the devices." </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The meeting went on and as 
    this was the last meeting in Sweden and also the last one with Börje Stenström 
    attending, the subjects of discussions shall be outlined in some detail:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> JAIC: The vessel was assigned 
    the highest B.V. class symbol, it could consequently operate in worldwide 
    trade.<br>
    German 'Group of Experts': This is true, however, the trading area of a passenger 
    vessel is defined in the PSSC, which is issued only after the class certificate 
    has been submitted to F.B.N. The PSSC restricted the trade of the vessel to 
    "kustfaart mellan Finland och Sverige", i.e. coastal trade between Finland 
    and Sweden. <br>
    JAIC: This restriction referred to the radio operator only. In case AB Sally 
    would have put a radio operator onboard the ferry could have traded "Short 
    international voyages", i.e. 600 nm between 2 ports and no more than 200 nm 
    from the next port, i.e. the ferry could have sailed between Helsinki and 
    Gothenburg. <br>
    German 'Group of Experts': It had been agreed in the building contract that 
    the vessel had to be built for an "intended trade", i.e. for the Viking Line 
    service Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm. <br>
    JAIC: This referred only to the "partial collision door" while the contract 
    is otherwise open. <br>
    German 'Group of Experts': The well known fact that the "partial collision 
    door" was not installed is indeed proof that the vessel was built for a particular 
    trade, for which according to the opinion of the responsible maritime administration 
    - F.B.N. - such a "partial collision door" at the location required by SOLAS 
    was not necessary.<br>
    JAIC: It was also in 1979/80 a well known fact that the Finnish and Swedish 
    owners sold their ferries after 8-10 years in service to owners operating 
    in entirely different areas of the world. Thus it would only be logical to 
    build the ferries for worldwide trade.<br>
    German 'Group of Experts': This is the shipowners' concern. The yard builds 
    the vessel according to the contractual agreements, class rules and requirements 
    of the maritime administration.<br>
    Subsequently the development of the ferries built for AB Slite and AB Sally 
    from 1969 to 1980 beginning with "APOLLO" and "DIANA" and ending with "VIKING 
    SALLY" was explained, the discussion between Sjöfartsverket/Wahnes on basis 
    of his logbook concerning "bow ramp = collision bulkhead" for "DIANA II" the 
    attitude of the F.B.N. as to "VIKING SALLY", etc. were outlined. Further the 
    "Copenhagen Convention" was handed over as well as this 'Group of Experts' 
    report about "The description of the process of conversion from design to 
    production of the locking devices" which can be found as part of Subchapter 
    2.4.6. This 'Group of Experts' explained also the background of the "partial 
    collision door" clause in the "VIKING SALLY" specification ("EARL OF GRANVILLE" 
    conversion) and the initial offer of the yard to install this partial collision 
    door for DM 45.000,-- which was rejected by the owners. It would, however, 
    have been possible at any time to have these doors installed for less than 
    DM 100.000,-- in case the trading area would be changed to outside of "sheltered 
    waters" as it occurred when the ferry's route was changed to Tallinn-Stockholm. 
    <br>
    JAIC: Probably a yard has to argue differently than a Government commission, 
    who will definitely and sharply draw attention to the faulty practice followed 
    by the maritime administrations of the Nordic countries for decades by accepting 
    the bow ramp as upper extension of the collision bulkhead on car/passenger 
    ferries. The JAIC is of the considered opinion that according to SOLAS the 
    maritime administra-tions may not grant exemptions in this respect, even not 
    if the ferry trades regularly within 20 nm from the nearest land. Stenström 
    said that it is a fact that in the Baltic about 70 ferries have been trading 
    on which the bow ramp was the collision bulkhead. Of these 70 ferries 35 had 
    the interlock between ramp and visor. The first vessel with such a construction 
    was built in Finland. Meyer Werft is not responsible for it, Stenström said. 
    It is considered a fact that the way "VIKING SALLY's" visor/bow ramp were 
    built corresponded in those years absolutely to the state of the art and technique.

  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">On 30 November Klaus Rahka 
    from the Finnish JAIC phoned a member of this 'Group of Experts' and reported 
    the following:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had carried out 
      a break test with the mock-up of a side lock. It broke at 134 ts. load.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They further carried 
      out a bending test with the mock-up of the visor lug being part of the Atlantic 
      lock. The load required to cause a deformation as found was found to be 
      200 ts., i.e. the Atlantik lock had held at least 200 ts according to Klaus 
      Rahka.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Börje Stenström was present 
      during the tests and his comment at the end was: "We are not changing the 
      report. Why should we be that friendly to the yard?" </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This attitude was also reflected 
    in the next telephone conversation on 12 December when Börje Stenström stated 
    the following:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> The publication of the 
    Final Report had been postponed.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> They had a full commission 
    meeting last Monday/Tuesday (04./ 05.12) with Andi Meister, Enn Neidre, Uno 
    Laur and two professors attending from Estonia. </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Purpose of the meeting was 
    to establish what else had to be done.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> As far as the technical 
    side was concerned (his job) they believed that the factual side was well 
    covered by the Part-Report already, which would not be changed very much, 
    although some analysis will still be carried out.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> On the operational side 
    they would have a long distance to go because the Estonians practically had 
    not delivered anything, although Andi Meister - being no more a Minister - 
    was said to be writing every day. Enn Neidre and Uno Laur have neither commented 
    in writing nor verbally, they are absolutely passive. T</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">he Swedish and Finnish side 
    developed the opinion they have to investigate the operational/educational 
    side themselves, but do not know how, because the information is more or less 
    exclusively in Estonia. They had hoped that something would come from their 
    Minister, but so far in vain.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Next meeting will only 
    be mid February 1996. </font> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This means that the date 
      for the publication of the Final JAIC Report, announced with so much enthusiasm 
      only a couple of months before had been postponed to some unknown time in 
      the future. <br>
      In this connection a fax has to be mentioned which was sent by Kari Lethola 
      already on 12 November to Olof Forssberg only, which reads - office translation 
      - as follows:<br>
      <i>"Representatives of the F.B.N., Chief Director Muttilainen (No. 2 in 
      the organisation), Valkonen, the legal man Makkonen and the engineer Fabricius 
      - met at the beginning of last week in Hamburg Holtappels, Hummel and possibly 
      some other representatives of Jos. L. Meyer Werft. The yard had invited 
      them to come to Hamburg. Simo Aarnio interviewed Makkonen subsequently. 
      Makkonen repor-ted that the yard's representatives had first asked whether 
      the F.B.N. had anything "against the yard". The answer was no. Possibly 
      the yard wanted to check whether there could be a conflict of interests 
      between F.B.N. and the yard in case of possible legal proceedings in the 
      future. Thereafter they presented the results of their investigation. I 
      hope that we shall have the same information after the Friday meeting in 
      Stockholm. In any event, they do further maintain their theory that the 
      hinges broke first and not the Atlantic Sicherung. Fabricius took the same 
      view during subsequent discussions. He had inspected the visor in Hangö 
      before the trip to Hamburg. Tuomo and Klaus shall come and interview Fabricius 
      pretty soon. <br>
      The Papenburgers have also pointed out that "Estonia" had traded with a 
      water-filled visor for quite a long time already (almost all the time). 
      There are clear indications for that inside the visor.<br>
      Holtappels did further indicate that in case of possible legal proceedings 
      against the yard they would right from the beginning disregard the JAIC 
      investigation results to the effect that no one could use it as evidence 
      against the yard. This would be done on the grounds of bias (partiality) 
      of all three Estonian members. Holtappels did not give any reason for this, 
      but possibly he means that </i></font></p>
  </li>
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Andi (Meister) had at 
    the time of the casualty the political responsi-bility for the appropriate 
    safety rules and also because the govern-ment had been the owner of the company, 
    which partly owned the vessel and/or had been the operator.</font></i></li>
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> Enn (Neidre) is working 
    as safety chief for Estline, which partly owned the vessel. </font></i></li>
  <li><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Uno (Laur) was Enn's 
    predecessor in this job.</font> </i> 
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> We shall possibly continue 
      to discuss this matter. <br>
      Regards, Kari" </font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The contents of this fax 
      allows the following rather astonishing conclusions:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> (a) Even after almost 
      14 months of "joint" investigations the Estonians - although being in the 
      chair - were not informed and thus did not take part in crucial decisions 
      concerning the reliability and credibility of JAIC. <br>
      (b) The chairmen of the Finnish and Swedish JAICs were pretty much aware 
      of the background of all three Estonian members and as Olof Forssberg reported 
      to Inez Uzman, the Swedish Minister for Communication and Transport, and 
      Kari Lethola reported to the Minister for Justice in Helsinki, it has to 
      be assumed with certainty that the problems were well known at least inside 
      these administrations as parts of the respective Governments. Nevertheless 
      nothing was done from their side until Dr. Holtappels raised the point. 
      It finally led to the resignation of Enn Neidre in April 1996 as member 
      of the JAIC. He remained, however, an expert of the Estonian JAIC and as 
      such participated undisturbed in the work, had access to the complete documentation, 
      attended the meetings as before and even participated in the drafting of 
      the Final Report. Whether this nominal change in the position of Enn Neidre 
      did improve the reliability and credibility of the JAIC is a question for 
      the reader to decide. <br>
      (c) Remarkable is finally how experts with differing opinions - like Mr. 
      Fabricius - were being treated: Tuomo and Klaus had "to talk" to him. <br>
      Note: As a matter of fact engineer Fabricius never showed up again in this 
      case. <br>
      (d) The meeting between the F.B.N. and this 'Group of Experts' was already 
      the second one and confidentiality had been agreed. The validity of agreements 
      with the management of F.B.N. seems to be rather short. In this case it 
      was broken by F.B.N. immediately after their return to Helsinki. <br>
      At a subsequent meeting in Helsinki on 23 November between Kari Lethola/ 
      Klaus Rahka and a member of this 'Group of Experts' the following information 
      was received:<br>
      - Andi Meister, the head of the International Commission (IHK), was no more 
      the Estonian Minister of Transport but was sitting at his home writing the 
      Estonian version of the report; they had so far however received nothing. 
      <br>
      - Uno Laur as the personal representative of the President of Estonia in 
      the "Estonia" matter came together with the President, Andi Meister, Enn 
      Neidre and the then Prime Minister by military plane to Turku on 28 or 29.09.94 
      - probably 28.09.94. The Prime Minister was at first also a member of the 
      Estonian intermediate commission but was subsequently fired, when it turned 
      out that he was a weapons smuggler. Tuomo Karppinen was also in Turku on 
      that day, the first one in the early morning hours had been Kari Lethola.<br>
      Note: According to the notes made by prosecutor Birgitta Cronier, then in 
      charge of the ESTONIA case, on the morning of 28 September 1994 "Kari Lethola 
      is already on site in Utö". See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.463.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      38.5.463.</a></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The co-operation between 
      the part commissions could be better. Each national part of the JAIC was 
      working internally on its subject, the exchange of information/documentation 
      was basically restricted to the meetings. This refers in particular to the 
      Estonians who have produced very little, so far, but also to the Swedes. 
      Börje Stenström is an acknowledged expert in naval architecture, but it 
      seems almost impossible to persuade him of other alternatives once he has 
      made up is mind. He is not a good casualty investigator. They are expecting 
      a lot of problems before the Final Report is agreed upon.<br>
      - They know nothing about the working lists where the twisted port hinge 
      of the bow ramp was mentioned repeatedly for repairs.<br>
      - This 'Group of Experts' explained to them the connection water in visor 
      / gap in ramp / water on car deck / clothing around the port hinge of the 
      ramp. They were themselves puzzled about the many clothings hanging around 
      that area which could only be explained as the crew plugging the gap in 
      the ramp from time to time when the ramp and visor were closed.<br>
      - They will continue to investigate the above circumstances. The probability 
      that the scuppers on the car deck were open was also discussed, that one 
      or several non-return valves were blocked, that pipes leading from scuppers 
      on car deck towards outboard through the 1st deck (deck below car deck) 
      were corroded/leaking and in connection with open non-return valves water 
      penetrated the starboard side of the 1st deck (vessel had a permanent starboard 
      list of 4-5° around which she was rolling probably up to 10° to starboard).<br>
      - In the further discussion it became very obvious that they would like 
      to do a much more technical investigation with the fantastic possibilities 
      they have in VTT, however, however this was rejected by the Swedes respectively 
      allowed to a rather limited scope only. <br>
      - They were also informed about the repeated invitations of this 'Group 
      of Experts' to the JAIC to come to Hamburg and Papenburg, to talk to the 
      von Tell representative and relevant yard workers, which they did not know 
      at all. Obviously the channel of information between the JAIC and this 'Group 
      of Experts' ended on the private desk of Börje Stenström. The invitation 
      was repeated to them and they promised to consider. <br>
      - Kari Lethola promised to try to find the passenger of "SILJA FESTIVAL" 
      who has told the newspaper HELSINGIN SANOMAT (published 29.09.94) that ESTONIA 
      left Tallinn with open visor.<br>
      Note: At that time the statement of this passenger had been in the file 
      of Lethola for sometime already. He denied during the following 2 years 
      frequently to know the name, however, when some of his files were finally 
      inspected by members of this 'Group of Experts' in December 1998 the statement 
      was found and copied. See <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/19.236.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      19.236.</a><br>
      - It was agreed to send them everything in copy which was sent to the Swedish 
      Commission and further on to send them blind covers. <br>
      This was the first time for this 'Group of Experts' to get the chance to 
      look at the other side of the coin and make the amazing experience that 
      the relationship between the Finnish and the Swedish parts of the JAIC was 
      not as good as demonstrated to the outside and, in particular, that this 
      was basically due to the behaviour of Börje Stenström. Moreover, that Stenström 
      basically dictated the scope of the technical investigations exclusively 
      in accordance with the hypothetical casualty scenario and the cause considerations 
      developed by him. <br>
      Already in December everything which had been submitted in writing to Stenström 
      was sent in copy to the Finnish part of the JAIC and further on they received 
      blind copies of all correspondence. <br>
      It was also considered to be remarkable that Stenström had not informed 
      the Finns about the damaged port outer hinge of the bow ramp and the consequentially 
      open part of the bow ramp to the water-filled visor, which, in fact, rendered 
      the ferry initially unseaworthy with the privity of her owners/ tech-nical 
      managers. The Estonian part of the JAIC knowing these circumstances, of 
      course, from their questioning of the relief crew remained silent. It is 
      unknown what the Finns did after having been informed by this 'Group of 
      Experts' about such grave deficiency as the partly open bow ramp being plugged 
      with mattresses, blankets and similar material to avoid the worst - water 
      in large quantities on the car deck - from the always at sea water-filled 
      visor. No official reaction was noted until Karpinnen made himself the laughing 
      stock of the shipping community when he invented the "floating mattresses" 
      during the press conference in which the Final Report was presented. <br>
      The total disregard of Börje Stenström for orderly investigation is further 
      demonstrated by the way in which he chose to file documentation he received 
      in his capacity as JAIC member. Instead of having the documents registered 
      in the logbook as provided for by law he kept them unregistered at home. 
      Only after his death in February 1997 were these documents found in his 
      house, and subsequently registered with the small notation "Inh. fr. BS 
      971006 or 970326" meaning "Arrived from Börje Stenström on 06.10.97 or 26.03.97". 
      This should of course also have been done with the repair lists of ESTONIA 
      on which the repair request for the damaged port outer hinge of the bow 
      ramp was made, however these lists were never registered.<br>
      Note: The alleged "List of maintenance and repair works on M.V. 'Estonia': 
      April 1993 - August 1994" - attached as Supplement 230 - just contains the 
      engine and electrical part - deck is not mentioned. Moreover this "List" 
      was received by the Swedish JAIC from N&T only on 31.10.97 - five weeks 
      before the publication of the Final Report. - See Enclosure<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.465.htm" target="_blank"> 
      38.5.465.</a> <br>
      The year 1995 ended with a letter from Börje Stenström dated 22 December 
      by which he asked in total 11 questions with regard to the contents of the 
      memo this 'Group of Experts' had handed over at the November meeting - the 
      letter is attached as Enclosure <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.5.464.htm" target="_blank">38.5.464 
      </a>and shall be commented on in connection with the reply dated 22 January 
      1996. </font></p>
