  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b> CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>1.</b> The vessel was 
    designed in accordance with the state of the Art and the Rules and Regulations 
    applicable at the time of design and building by one of the shipyards most 
    experienced in the building of such type of ships, which had just completed 
    a Near-Sister-Vessel. (See Chapters <a href="underfinnishflag.htm" target="_blank">2.1</a>, 
    <a href="2.2.htm" target="_blank">2.2</a>, <a href="2.3.htm" target="_blank">2.3,</a> 
    <a href="2.4.1.htm" target="_blank">2.4.1</a> and <a href="2.4.2.htm">2.4.2.</a>and 
    <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a> JAIC) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>2.</b> The vessel was 
    constructed in accordance with the state of the Art, the approved design and 
    under the supervision of a very experienced and competent Class-surveyor. 
    (See Chapters <a href="2.4.2.htm" target="_blank">2.4.2,</a> <a href="2.4.3.htm" target="_blank">2.4.3,</a> 
    <a href="2.4.5.htm" target="_blank">2.4.5</a>, <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">2.4.6 
    </a>and <a href="2.6.1-2.htm" target="_blank">2.6</a>. JAIC maintains, that 
    the building yard did not adhere to it's own design criteria (Chapter 15 JAIC).This 
    conclusion however is based on the wrong assumption, that the welding seams 
    found on the wreck were laid during the construction of the vessel. (See Chapters 
    <a href="3.2.4-3.3.htm" target="_blank">3.3</a>, <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, 
    <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a> and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>.) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>3.</b> The procedure chosen 
    by the Finnish Board of Navigation (FBN) in the issuance of Passengership 
    Safety Certificates whilst the vessel was under it's jurisdiction did not 
    completely comply with the SOLAS Regulations in force at that time, but this 
    failure of FBN did not contribute to the accident. (See Chapters <a href="2.4.4.htm" target="_blank">2.4.4</a> 
    and <a href="6.5.2.htm" target="_blank">6.5.2</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>4. </b>Whilst being owned 
    and managed by her previous Finnish owners (Sally and Silja) the vessel was 
    reasonably well maintained. Design or construction defects were not noted, 
    although the vessel cruised for twelve years in the Baltic Sea. At the time 
    of delivery of the vessel to her new Owners, she had deficiencies, which were 
    however quite normal for a ship of her age and in her trade. These deficiencies 
    were reported by the staff on board to Silja, the then managers of the vessel. 
    This report became known to the new managers, being Nordström & Thulin, who 
    however chose not to take note. These deficiencies then developed fast to 
    the worse and into a substantial contributing cause of the accident. (See 
    Chapters <a href="3.4.htm" target="_blank">3.4</a> and <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5.1</a>) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>5. </b>Acting as mandatory 
    of the Estonian National Maritime Board (ENMB), Bureau Veritas on 7.2.1993 
    issued an Interim Passengership Safety Certificate for MV ESTONIA. This was 
    done in obvious violation of the relevant Regulations of SOLAS. Had the responsible 
    inspector of Bureau Veritas complied with his duties and refused the issuance 
    of a Passengership Safety Certificate, the new Owners would have been forced 
    to install the extension of the collision bulkhead above main deck and had 
    this been done, the vessel would - with all probability - have survived, despite 
    of all her other deficiencies. (See Chapters<a href="6.4.htm" target="_blank"> 
    6.4</a>, <a href="6.5.htm" target="_blank">6.5 </a>and 9.1)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>6.</b> At Sea the vessel 
    was operated recklessly in ice and during bad weather, which caused a further 
    worsening of the deficiencies taken over with the vessel and added new ones, 
    the most outstanding of which was, that the visor was pushed out of its geometry, 
    vibrated and was constantly filled with water to the outside water level at 
    sea. No attempt was made to rectify these deficiencies. It has to be assumed, 
    that the responsible staff at Nordström & Thulin was aware of these further 
    deficiencies as well. (See Chapters <a href="chapter12.htm" target="_blank">12.1</a> 
    to <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.6,</a> <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a> 
    and <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>7.</b> The most crucial 
    deficiency developed in 1994: The port outer hinge of the bow ramp became 
    twisted, could consequently not be secured properly anymore and lost it's 
    watertightness. Ever since water from the filled visor flowed into the car 
    deck at sea, despite the efforts of the crew to prevent the ingress of water 
    by plugging the gaps with linen and mattresses. As the watertightness of the 
    bow ramp - when deemed to be the extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    main deck - is a mandatory condition of SOLAS, the Rules of Bureau Veritas 
    and the Load Line Convention, MV ESTONIA had lost it's class notation and 
    it's seaworthiness, when being traded with an untight bow ramp. (See Chapters 
    <a href="12.4.3.htm" target="_blank">12.4.3</a>, <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4</a>, 
    <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a> 
    and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>8.</b> It is common knowledge 
    with the Owners or Operators of Ro-Ro Passengerships, that water on the car 
    deck must under any and all circumstances be avoided as it unavoidably lessens 
    the stability of the vessel, being the vital safety criterion of each passengership. 
    It has to be assumed, that the responsible staff at Nordström & Thulin was 
    aware of the loss of watertightness of the bow ramp and the consequential 
    ingress of water onto the car deck from the water-filled visor. No attempt 
    was made however to rectify this unacceptable condition. (See Chapter <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>) 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>9.</b> It should have 
    been detected at least by those whose duty it was, to control safe operation 
    of Passengerships trading between Estonia and Sweden for the benefit of their 
    passengers. This refers especially to the inspections conducted by the inspector 
    of Bureau Veritas - also acting as mandatory of ENMB - shortly before the 
    casualty and - especially - the inspection of MV ESTONIA on the day before 
    the casualty by leading personnel of Sjöfartsinspectionen (SHIPINSPEC) and 
    ENMB. During this inspection the most serious deficiencies at the bow area 
    were found and noted, but - although the vessel could have been stopped by 
    order of the Estonian members of ENMB in Tallinn or by refusal to permit entry 
    into Swedish waters or ports through the leading personnel of Sjöfartsverket 
    - nothing was done. (See Chapters<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> 9.1</a>,<a href="chapter9.htm" target="_blank"> 
    9.3, </a><a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">15 
    </a>and <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>) </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>10. </b>There were further 
    grave deficiencies in the vessel, when she left for her last voyage:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> I. Due to fatigue cracks 
      caused by the vibrations of the visor and unqualified repair work the hinges 
      of the visor had lost nearly all of their design strength. (See Chapters 
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter16.htm" target="_blank">16.2</a>, 
      <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>, <a href="34.8.htm" target="_blank">34.8 
      </a>and <a href="34.9.htm" target="_blank">34.9</a>) <br>
      II. The stempost of the visor had been cracked four times due to fatigue 
      caused by the vibration of the visor. Consequently it could not support 
      the weight of the visor anymore. The visor did instead rest on the forepeak 
      deck which fact caused misalignment of the visor and all its locking- and 
      holding devices far exceeding the permissible tolerances. (See Chapters 
      <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) 
      <br>
      III. The vessel left port with a starboard list, which was caused by uncontrolled 
      water ingress into the vessel through a hole in the shell plating. (See 
      Chapter <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.1</a>) The cargo in the 
      vessel was not lashed according to regulations despite knowledge of vessel's 
      command of the coming heavy weather. (See Chapters <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">17.2</a>, 
      <a href="chapter18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>11.</b> The grave deficiencies 
    described in 5, 7 and 10 above rendered the vessel unseaworthy. When she left 
    the port of Tallinn, she was not permitted to carry passengers, cargo or crew 
    under all relevant international or Estonian national regulations. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"><b>12.</b> The vessel was 
    run on full engine power in very rough seas up and until the casualty. This 
    fact constitutes a gross violation of the principles of good seamanship and 
    shows disrespect for the comfort of the passengers. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) 
    Had the vessel been in a seaworthy condition however, such facts would not 
    have mattered, as they did not over the past 14,5 years of her trade in the 
    Baltic Sea. Under conditions as given on the night of the 28th of September 
    1994 this excessive speed started the known deficiencies to interlink and 
    thereby the chain of causes to unravel which led irreversibly to the foundering 
    of MV ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>13. </b>This 'Group of 
    Experts' has used all efforts and possibilities available to it to investigate 
    the actual casualty scenario. All available crew members and survivors were 
    interrogated by members of this 'Group of Experts' or by experts instructed 
    by it. (See Chapters <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a> and <a href="chapter21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>) 
    Substantial evidence unknown so far was collected. (See Chapters <a href="chapter22.htm" target="_blank">22</a> 
    to <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>) The Group purposely refrained 
    from taking refuge to hypothetical assumptions in it's attempt to establish 
    the casualty scenario but rather made it their point to seek the truth based 
    on facts only. Only evidence confirmed by other facts was considered permissible 
    evidence in the establishment of the casualty scenario by this 'Group of Experts'. 
    The result of these efforts is the casualty scenario described in Chapter 
    31. It demonstrates that the vessel was already in a crucial situation, which 
    should have prompted immediate return at 20.45 hours at which time it was 
    still under coastal shelter. (See Chapter <a href="chapter20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>) 
    That occasion having been missed the vessel was doomed to death as the water 
    ingress into the car deck constantly increased until it finally became overwhelming.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> <b>14. </b>When scrutinizing 
    the underwater videos made available to this 'Group of Experts' by JAIC astonishing 
    facts were discovered. Although these facts do not contribute to the task 
    of the Group, the most important of them shall be reported here briefly: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">I. The underside of the 
      port bridge wing had apparently been torn open, when the vessel was already 
      resting on the seabed. (See Chapters <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> 
      and<a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank"> 34.6</a>) <br>
      II. Divers of the "official" teams took time to search for, find and salvage 
      a certain suitcase belonging to a gentleman with the reputation of being 
      engaged in the smuggling of weapons. (Chapter<a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank"> 
      27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br>
      III. There is evidence, that there has been movement of the bow ramp, when 
      the vessel was already resting on the seabed. (See Chapter <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)<br>
      IV. There is evidence, that other than the "official" diving teams were 
      in the vessel, especially in the car deck. (See Chapters <a href="chapter25.htm" target="_blank">25.1</a>, 
      <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27</a> and <a href="34.6.htm" target="_blank">34.6</a>)It 
      has to be assumed that the other divers had entered the wreck with the knowledge 
      and permission of Swedish Government Authorities. No records of their activities 
      are available. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">After thorough investigation 
    of some of the underwater videos a world renowned expert came to the conclusion, 
    that explosions had occurred on MV ESTONIA's bow. (See Chapters <a href="chapter32.htm" target="_blank">32.1</a>, 
    <a href="chapter7.htm" target="_blank">7</a> and<a href="34.7.htm" target="_blank"> 
    34.7.1</a>) These conclusions have not been taken into consideration when 
    establishing the casualty scenario. The sole reason was, that these conclusions 
    have to be seen in conjunction with the repeated reports about a "big hole 
    on the starboard side" (See Chapter <a href="chapter36.htm" target="_blank">36.3</a>). 
    Whether there were explosions can only be established with certainty by metallurgical 
    examination of the metal affected from the wreck and whether there actually 
    is a big hole on the starboard side can only - but easily - be established 
    with certainty, if and when the Swedish authorities release the underwater 
    video tapes taken of the wreck by different diving teams in their original 
    version i.e. without any tapering therewith. Only after such further investigations 
    have been held, is it possible for anybody to establish the true causes for 
    the foundering of MV ESTONIA. </font></p>
