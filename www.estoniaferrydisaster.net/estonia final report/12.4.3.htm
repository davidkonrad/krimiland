  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b> Manfred 
    Salzberg</b> - travelled together with his wife on 01.02.94 to Tallinn on 
    board ESTONIA by car. Upon arrival in Tallinn the crew was unable to open 
    the bow ramp. It took one hour before they were able to open it by means of 
    heavy hammers. (Why didn't they warm it up?) It was frozen fast. He has a 
    number of pictures showing the forepart.</font></font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Henning Frederiksson</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">: 
    Out of 6 trips, the last one on 12/13 June 1994, he and his wife saw 5 incidents 
    when crew members were banging on the locking bolts of the bow ramp with sledge 
    hammers. He recalls the upper starboard and lower port bolt. It took the crew 
    10 minutes and more to open or close one bolt. They always drove on board 
    among the first cars at Stockholm, thus were close to the bow ramp and could 
    observe the activities of the crew rather closely. </font></li>

    - travelled on the ESTONIA in September 1994: The car deck was wet. Upon departure 
    from Stockholm the crew was unable to close the visor. Quite a number of crew 
    members were jumping around on the forecastle deck. Upon departure from Tallinn, 
    one week later, the departure was delayed by 2 hours because the visor could 
    not be closed. </font></li>

  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Anton B. Paulomo</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">: 
    In July 1994 two of his friends were travelling by bus from a place in Lithuania 
    together with a couple of others via Tallinn on the ESTONIA to Stockholm for 
    shopping. On the way back they had to wait for 3 hours in Tallinn before the 
    crew was able to open the visor, which was only possible after some burning/cutting 
    had taken place. They left the bus and went up to the 8th deck overlooking 
    the forecastle deck from where they observed what the crew and subsequently 
    also workers from ashore were doing. The statements of Anton Paulomo and his 
    two friends will be available.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Gerhard Stenhammer</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    - a Stockholm pilot and now retired, had observed shortly before the casualty 
    that after departure from Frihamn Terminal the crew tried to close the visor 
    for 15 minutes by opening/closing with loud bangs until it became silent. 
    The master explained that the crew again had problems with closing the visor. 
    The pilot asked the master whether the locking devices would still fit and 
    the answer was 'no problem'. In the opinion of pilot Stenhammer the visor 
    was 'out of geometry'.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Lars Lindström</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    - was on board as a passenger with car the last week in July 1994. Their car 
    was the last one to roll on board in Tallinn, the bow ramp was closed behind 
    them and they were leaving the car when he realised that 2 crew members were 
    trying to lock the starboard lower bolt of the bow ramp, which did not work. 
    A third one came with an iron bar in his hand, was hammering a couple of times 
    on the pocket, without the bolt moving at all, whereafter they turned round 
    and walked away by saying: <i>"It can remain as it is"</i>, although the bolt 
    was not locked. (He speaks and understands Estonian.) He has subsequently 
    written a letter to Estline AB and complained about the above, whereafter 
    he received a letter stating that the securing bolts and locking devices were 
    the responsibility of a Finnish engineer company, the name of whom he also 
    received. He wrote to them as well as to Det norske Veritas, but never received 
    a reply. (The respective memo is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.154.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.3.154</a>.)</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kari Holmsten</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    (trained as a shipyard welder) made more than 50 trips on the ESTONIA, lost 
    his wife and children during the casualty.<br>
    It was on 3 March 1994 when they arrived in Tallinn and when for the first 
    time he noted that something was wrong with the ferry. His car was the second 
    one from forward and he watched how the crew tried in vain to open the visor, 
    he was nervous because he had to reach the Belorussian Embassy before they 
    closed to obtain a visa. He speaks and understands the Estonian language, 
    thus picked up from crew members talk that they were unable to unlock the 
    side locks of the visor, he left his car and told the crew members to lift 
    / lower / lift / lower, etc. the visor in short intervals and, when lowering, 
    try to open the side locks simultaneously, they followed the advice and after 
    about 30 minutes they finally managed to open the visor and subsequently also 
    the bow ramp, which did not create problems. There was no ice in the port 
    of Tallinn at the time, however, he seems to remember that there had been 
    ice at sea.<br>
    Later, probably on 27 March 1994 he was again on his way to Tallinn when the 
    same happened, but this time it took the crew only 15-20 minutes to open the 
    visor.<br>
    He had the definite impression that the visor was totally misaligned and did 
    not fit anymore into the locking devices. The interview is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.3.155.htm" target="_blank">

    Haukka</b> (retired, 68 years) </font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I have made 
        at least 20-25 trips between Tallinn-Stockholm on the ESTONIA.<br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
        knew Captain Arvo Andresson personally, have been on the bridge at least 
        3 times. He made a sympathetic, open and experienced impression on me, 
        however, I don't know anything about his behaviour in unusual situations.<br>
        Concerning the bow ramp I would like to state that in January 1994 in 
        Tallinn I, together with many others, had to wait for ca. 45 minutes because 
        they were unable to unlock the ramp. It could not be opened. My car was 
        the first one to leave the car deck which I had arranged respectively 
        with the chief officer. The car was the first in line at port side, directly 
        next to the hydraulic pump controls which were at port side. <br>
        They had a problem with the system and alleged that the ramp was frozen 
        fast.<br>
        The Estonian crew members tried to open the bow ramp in vain for about 
        20 minutes by operating the hydraulic different ways, then started to 
        hammer against the what he believed were the securing bolts, also in vain, 
        then they asked the Swedish adviser to come down and he believes it was 
        Karl Karell. He stepped out of the car, shook hands with him and said: 
        'Why do the Estonians switch off the hydraulic system at sea?' He shrugged 
        and said something like "one year with Estonians is more than enough", 
        but he did something whereafter it was possible for the crew to open the 
        bow ramp and they left the ferry.«</font></i></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»I have very 
        often waited on the car deck for 1-2 hours, once in May 1994 even 4 hours 
        before the crew was able to open the visor and/or bow ramp. In May 1994 
        the crew was unable to open the visor in spite of all sorts of attempts. 
        Finally crew members brought 2 gas bottles plus burning gear to the door 
        in the starboard side house. The 2 gas bottles were on wheels and were 
        left in front of the door whilst the crew members pulled the hoses into 
        the side house together with the burning gear. I was curious what they 
        would now do and tried to enter the door, however, I was blocked off by 
        crew members. I saw sparks falling down further forward and after some 
        time visor and bow ramp opened. The bow ramp could only be opened or closed 
        after 3-4 ups and downs, i.e. the crew was unable to open or close the 
        ramp in one go.<br>

        friend Jonny, who is also a truck driver in the same trade, once told 
        me that he had observed from the car deck side that the crew was unable 
        to close the ramp, because only the starboard side came up whilst the 
        port side remained down. Only after several ups and downs of the ramp 
        and something else he could not identify, the crew managed to close the 
        ramp. I do clearly remember that the ramp was visibly bent.« </font></i></p>

    - a truck driver and businessman.</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»I have actually 
        seen crew members working at the bow ramp many times by hammering, welding 
        or cutting (burning). I have seen the gas bottles and considered it to 
        be very dangerous. As I am quite familiar with the way the crews from 
        ex Eastern Block countries work, I was, however, not too surprised. It 
        was clearly visible that the bow ramp was severely misaligned respectively 
        bent. In open condition the port side was much lower compared to the starboard 
        side. The bow ramp could not be opened in one go, but had to be raised/lowered 
        several times before it was finally down.<br>
        Before the ramp was lowered down completely to the quay two crew members 
        jumped on the quay and rolled one or two rope coils underneath the starboard 
        side of the ramp, which was still 30-40 cm above the quay when the port 
        side was already resting on it. I remember also to have seen that wooden 
        pallets were placed underneath the starboard side of the bow ramp instead 
        of the rope coils.<br>
        I am also of the opinion that, at least during the last months before 
        the catastrophe, the bow ramp could not be closed completely anymore, 
        because several times I observed from my position at the fore part of 
        the car deck that light was falling on to the car deck as soon as the 
        visor began to open, i.e. before the bow ramp itself was even moved. This, 
        in my opinion, is only possible if the bow ramp was already open to a 
        certain extent when the visor opened. The light came in at the upper port 
        side. The whole ramp was badly misaligned, in particular the port side 
        looked very bad, whilst the starboard side looked quite in order. Once 
        I saw a crew member standing on a wooden pallet which was lifted up by 
        a forklift standing behind the closed bow ramp at port side. The man was 
        lifted up to a position just underneath what I believe was the upper bolt. 
        After some hammering to the area where the bolt was located the man was 
        lowered down to the car deck again. <br>
        I also remember more or less always having seen a large number of wooden 
        pallets on the car deck, which were stowed behind the side houses at both 
        sides. <br>
        On my last trip to Tallinn before the casualty (I missed one sailing) 
        my car was on the hanging deck at starboard side. Thus I could not see 
        what was going on at the ramp and the visor when being opened. I saw, 
        however, crew members working at the bow ramp before it was lowered down. 
        When I drove down the ramp I saw the equipment for either welding or burning 
        (gas bottles) laying at port side near ramp. We had to wait longer than 
        normal, maybe half an hour or more before the bow ramp opened. I remember 
        this clearly, because I had people waiting for me at the quay who had 
        left before I was from board because it took so long. It could be the 
        time <b>when I saw the visor moving up and down several times before the 
        bow ramp opened combined with banging noises and also hammering.</b>«</i></font></p>

    - manager of a non-marine company and passenger together with his wife for 
    one trip Stockholm-Tallinn-Stockholm at the end of May 1994. </font>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»We boarded 
        the ferry in Stockholm and were the last people to come onboard, because 
        we had first gone to the wrong terminal. As we were late the ship left 
        straight away. After we had settled down in the cabin, I believe on the 
        6th deck, which was overlooking the foreship, I went to the window and 
        looked down onto the foreship while the vessel was proceeding through 
        the archipelago. I immediately had the impression that it was a very old 
        vessel in a bad condition. I saw a couple of empty foundations where the 
        parts belonging on top, e.g. mooring winches and the like, had been taken 
        away. I had a rather negative impression from the beginning, also that 
        apparently a lot of paint layers were used without taking care for what 
        was underneath. I also noted that the mooring ropes were substantially 
        worn and in a bad condition. They looked simply worn and over-stretched. 
        <br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
        also saw two crew members on the port side of the forecastle deck. The 
        bigger man was standing on the visor facing me and was hammering with 
        a big sledge hammer on the port edge of the visor which was extending 
        the forepeak deck by some 10 cm. The gap was in any event big enough so 
        that I showed it to my wife. We could see the water through the gap. The 
        other man was standing on the forecastle deck opposite to the one with 
        the sledge hammer and I could only see his back side. The visor was obviously 
        not properly closed because its port side was standing upwards above the 
        level of the forecastle deck, worse at the port outer corner on which 
        the crew member was hammering, apparently without success, as far as I 
        remember.<br>
        The window could only be opened by force. I also checked the nearest way 
        to the rescue station. I think we stayed in the cabin for about 1 hour, 
        after some time the hammering stopped but the visor edge was still standing 
        up.«</font></i></p>
