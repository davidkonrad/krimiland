    for production and control. The reference numbers can be found in the box 
    at the upper right side of each drawing. Some of these detail drawings can 
    also be found in the "Drawing file" behind the respective master drawing. 
    In the "Drawing file", which is part of this documentation, all the above

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In detail: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) - The Bow Visor 
    was built in the fabrication hall according to drawings of Messrs. von Tell 
    AB, Gothenburg in the same way as already one year before the visor for DIANA 
    II had been built. It was moved out of the hall into the open on 15.01.80 
    and remained there until it was fitted to the vessel between 01.03. and 15.3.80. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the 
    time the visor was in the open air storage the hinge plates to be fitted to 
    the visor arms and at the forecastle deck were fabricated and the following 
    line of production developed:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- 1:10 shop: 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the 
    original drawings, 1:10 scaled "burning sketches" were made and fed into the 
    photo electric scanner steering the cutting machine, which subsequently cut 
    out lugs for Atlantic lock, hinge plates and side locks, which thereafter 
    were transported to the locksmith shop. Atlantic lock lugs were 15 mm respectively 
    60 mm in diameter, side locks and hinge plates were 60 mm thick. All parts 
    subsequently to be welded to vessel's structure were oversized in length. 
    The colour of the basic primer was yellow as can be seen from the photos attached 
    as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 2.4.6.63.</a><br>

    diameters according to drawings supplied were drilled into lugs and hinge 
    plates whereafter the parts were transported to the visor. - Welding of hinge 
    plates: The hinge plates were welded to the visor. During the welding procedure 
    its proper alignment was assured by the use of a pipe prepared specifically 
    for this purpose having the exact diameter of the hinge plate bores. One photo 
    shows the visor in open air with hinge plates already fitted (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.63.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Hinge system 
    made fit for functioning by cutting the hinge plates for vessel's side to 
    the required length, welding hinge plates to forecastle deck after proper 
    alignment had been ascertained by the use of the above-mentioned pipe tool. 
    Welding of steel bushings into the bores of the visor's hinge plates always 
    assuring proper alignment by means of the pipe tool, finally shrinking the 
    bronze bushings into the steel bushings, fitting in the Nirosta bolts and 
    fixing the securing plates. The visor hinge system is explained by the drawing 
    attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.6.66.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.6.66.</a> <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The von Tell 
    representative G.Todsen had supervised and controlled the Yard's work with 
    parts delivered by von Tell and with parts fabricated by the Yard according 
    to von Tell drawings. He also assisted whenever required. This refers in particular 
    to the installation of safety relevant parts, such as the hinges, the locking 
    devices, the lifting cylinders, and rubber packings. In detail the activities 
    of G.Todsen have been explained in his statement attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The installation 
    of the visor hinges have been carried out - according to Todsen - as follows: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">»Installation of 
      Hinges The bore holes for the bushings were made by means of a boring mill 
      in the fabrication hall. I personally took a close look at the bore holes 
      and touched them with my fingers before the bushings were installed and 
      can confirm that by no means were they burned holes. I would never have 
      accepted such dubbed work as can be seen on the photographs shown to me 
      of the remnants of ESTONIA's hinge plate. In case the yard would not have 
      taken notice of my objections, I would have left the ship and would have 
      informed my principals accordingly.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Under my 
      supervision on board the steel bushings were welded into the visor's arms 
      and subsequently bored out to the extent that the bronze bushings did fit. 
      These bores were carried out with extreme precision in order that port side 
      and starboard side were in alignment in order to avoid breaking tension 
      when opening resp. closing of the visor. Subsequently the bolts were guided 
      in whilst simultaneously the distance rings (2 mm thickness) were fitted. 
      I recall this work especially because it was rather fumbly work. The bolts 
      were made of Nirosta steel and had a grease groove with grease nipple. By 
      means of theses grease nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once 
      a week by grease gun.«</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) The Lifting 
    Cylinders (actuators) were also supplied by von Tell and installed under the 
    supervision and upon instructions of G.Todsen. Thereby the same care was applied 
    as had been done with the installation of the hinges. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) The Atlantic 
    Lock was also of von Tell design and mainly also supply. The Yard fabricated 
    only the 3 steel lugs at vessel's side plus the visor lug and carried out 
    the installation under the supervision of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. 
    The von Tell supply can be taken in detail from drawing 49111-373 - Atlantic 
    Lock - to be found in the "Drawing file". The yard performed as follows</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">:<br>
    The lugs of the Atlantic lock were cut out according to the respective burning 
    sketches in the 1:10 shop. The thickness of the 3 lugs to be welded to the 
    forepeak deck were 15 mm each and the visor lug was 60 mm. The parts subsequently 
    to be welded to vessel's structure were oversized. Thereafter the lugs were 
    transported to the locksmith shop, where the holes were drilled into the lugs 
    according to the relevant drawings and were subsequently transported to the 
    welders shop. Here one support bushing was welded into the starboard lug, 
    whilst the centre and port lugs were connected by another bushing, called 
    "bolt housing" by the JAIC, which was welded into the holes of both lugs.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Both bushings 
    were welded into the lugs by means of 7-8 mm seams from both sides in accordance 
    with yard standard and according to the von Tell drawings whilst the lugs 
    were lying flat. Performance was closely supervised by the von Tell representative 
    G.Todsen, who specifically stated that he never would have accepted the 3 
    mm welds visible on the pictures showing the remains of the Atlantic lugs. 
    In this connection G.Todsen explains (see his Statement -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.2.21</a>):</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The three 
      lugs, welded to the A-deck, as well as the lug at the aft part of the visor's 
      bottom are yard-supply. The 3 first mentioned lugs had been constructed 
      with overmeasure. It can be seen from the respective drawing that both bushings, 
      the bolt, the cylinder including piston rod, and the limit switches (sensors) 
      had been delivered by von Tell. The lug of the visor was welded and used 
      as fixing point for the alignment of the other three lugs of the Atlantic 
      lock. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 
      the workshop both bushings had been welded into the lugs in such a way that 
      the large bushing fitted between the middle and the port lug and the small 
      bushing into the starboard lug with the support bracket. As already mentioned 
      above, I have had detail drawings for all components from which among others 
      also the thickness of the welding seams were revealed.<br>
      The installation of the Atlantic lock was carried out as follows when the 
      visor was closed:<br>
      - The fixing point was the lug of the visor, <br>
      - accordingly hydraulic cylinder and the 3 lugs with already previously 
      welded bushings were aligned, burned to fit and welded.<br>
      Thereby I paid special attention to the even welding of the 3 lugs to the 
      A-deck, i.e. inner and outer side the same. Furthermore, I took care that 
      below each lug, in the void space under A-deck, a reinforcement was fitted.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) The Side Locks 
    were of similar design and construction as the Atlantic Lock, with all components 
    supplied by von Tell and the Yard only fabricating the steel parts and performing 
    the installation under the supervision of von Tell. This was carried out as 
    follows:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor was 
    closed and the required length of the lugs measured, the lugs cut respectively. 
    Location of lugs was marked at both bulkheads, the visor partly opened, and 
    the lugs welded on to the bulkheads. Thereafter the cleats of the manual locks 
    were also welded to the bulkheads. Flat bars welded at the inner side of the 
    bulkheads according to class surveyor's requirements and under supervision 
    and control of the von Tell representative G.Todsen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) The Rubber Packings 
    were installed on the forepeak deck to assure weathertightness of the visor 
    and a firm and tight connection between visor and vessel once the locking 
    devices were closed. By this tight connection high frequency vibration of 
    the visor with respective effects on its fixing points were avoided. In this 
    connection G.Todsen explains:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Prior to installing 
      the 50 mm thick rubber gaskets every 300 - 400 mm the distance between the 
      opposite parts visor/ship were measured by means of an inside calliper and 
      the deviations ascertained were compensated by flat iron. This way guaranteed 
      that the rubber gaskets installed afterwards had absolutely the same contact 
      pressure, as the visor was pressed into the rubber gaskets up to 8-10 mm, 
      which made the inside of the visor watertight (weathertight).<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During 
      the trial trip to Helgoland, among other things also the visor was checked 
      in respect of its tightness. The visor was totally locked, i.e. also the 
      manual locking devices were closed.<br>
      During full speed - i.e. about 2,5 m high bow wave and slightly pitching 
      vessel - myself, Mr. Lohmann, surveyor of Bureau Veritas, and a representative 
      of the owners, whose name I do not remember, were inside the visor and noted 
      that the visor was not totally watertight, but at some places water was 
      slightly leaking through. After returning to Emden the rubber packings were 
      marked with chalk, the visor was closed and opened again. Due to the remaining 
      imprints the leakings were found out and the rubber packings were raised 
      in these particular areas. During a subsequent tightness test the visor 
      was found to be tight and finally accepted by the owners, the Classification 
      Society and the Finnish Board of Navigation.<br>
      The official delivery took place already on 20 June 1980 - after successful 
      function test on 19 June 1980. Afterwards the attached Delivery Certificate 
      was filled in and signed by representatives of the owners, the B.V., the 
      shipyard and my colleague Brandt.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> B.V. surveyor Lohmann 
    also remembers that during trials some minor leakage was noted. He also remembers 
    that after return to Emden the respective rubber packings were adjusted and 
    a subsequent test revealed the visor to be watertight i.e. weathertight in 
    SOLAS terminology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (f) The Bow Ramp 
    was also installed under the control and supervision and with the assistance 
    of G.Todsen. His comments are:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The bow ramp 
      as well had been installed and arranged under my supervision. The securing 
      bolts were made to fit. During locking of the ramp at first each one hook 
      on each side of the corresponding parts of the ramp lowered and pulled the 
      ramp inwards, up until a special point had been reached and passed. Now 
      the ramp was tight in position. Then two bolts on each side moved out of 
      the ship into the corresponding pockets of the ramp.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      bolts snapped audibly into their end positions. As from the control console 
      on the car deck neither visor nor ramp locking devices could be seen, the 
      operator had to rely on the control lamps and his sense of hearing. It was 
      clearly audible by the snapping noises when the bolts engaged the pockets. 
      Only after the bolts had fully engaged did the sensors become activated, 
      which - if all bolts and also the hooks were in contact with the sensors 
      - led to the "green light" at the control console as well as on the bridge, 
      i.e. the ramp was closed and locked.« </font></i></p>
