  Surveys, Maintenance, Damage and Repairs</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The vessel 
    was maintained by the owners to class satisfaction in line with common practice 
    and requirements. The surveys for maintenance of class were carried out by 
    Bureau Veritas on a continuous five-year timetable for hull and machinery 
    in combination with a schedule of annual surveys. On average, the surveying 
    program involved five to six onboard-survey visits per year which were mainly 
    carried out by the principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, Lars-Olof 
    Ålander, who also carried out the Load Line Surveys on behalf of the F.B.N. 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.44.2</a>. At this time the visor was kept weathertight and the rubber 
    packings were renewed when required, at least once a year, either by MacGregor, 
    Turku or by the crew - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.99.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.99. </a><br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    annual drydockings were mostly done at the Turku Repair Yard. Two were at 
    the Valmet Helsinki Yard, one after grounding damage in 1984 and one in 1985 
    for repair of ice damage and for modification of the stern area of the hull 
    by incorporation of the "duck tail" extension. Two drydockings were made in 
    Stockholm, one in 1985 for repair of a leaking propeller shaft seal and one 
    in 1988 for repair of grounding damage. The damage was surveyed and repaired 
    in drydock following normal practice.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Besides the 
    ice damage in 1985, two other occasions of ice damage were recorded, during 
    the winters of 1982 and 1987. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The drydocking 
    in conjunction with transfer to the Effjohn Group was done in 1990 at the 
    Naantali branch of the Turku Repair Yard. Thereafter the vessel made some 
    trips as SILJA STAR in her initial trade and was then laid-up at the Perno 
    Shipyard outside Turku for some months until the beginning of 1991 when she 
    was put in service on the Vaasa trade. The interior was upgraded and the sound-proofing 
    in the cabin area was improved by building in ca. 85 tons of steel during 
    this time. Thereafter an inclining experiment was performed by Veli-Matti 
    Junilla of Ship Consulting Oy, Turku and a revised "Stability Booklet" issued, 
    which was approved by the F.B.N. (Edelmann) on 20.01.91 and is attached as

      to the opinion of the previous principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, 
      Lars-Olof Ålander, it was clear to everyone in the field and in the offices 
      that the bow ramp on all older ferries would not fulfil the SOLAS Regulation 
      10 requirement as upper extension of the collision bulkhead. However, it 
      was not and is not the field surveyor's business to criticise this design 
      characteristic - evidently approved by the head office - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    Enclosure 3.4.87</a> is a summary of B.V. inspections while the ferry was 
    flying the Finnish flag.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - B.V. surveyors 
    experienced the following in the course of time that the vessel sailed under 
    Finnish flag:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> on repeated occasions 
      the visor was closed with locking devices already in closed position. This 
      led to damages to lugs and bolts (also on DIANA II where the Atlantic lock 
      bolt was changed to a high tensile steel bolt).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Handling of the 
      visor and ramp always belonged to the chief officer's duties on Swedish/Finnish 
      ferries (on ESTONIA it was the boatwain's duty).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the vessel 
      went to Finboda/Stockholm BV-Stockholm took care, if she went to Wärtsilä/Turku 
      or Naantali it was the job of BV-Helsinki. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- According to Lars-Olof 
    Ålander the locking devices and sensors of the bow visor and the bow ramp 
    were always considered to be class items and not the responsibility of F.B.N.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is in direct contradiction to the explanations of BV-lawyer Bengt-Åke Johnson 
    on page 61 where he stated that locking devices were not the responsibility 
    of B.V.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - All electrical 
    systems were subjected to annual megger testing, therefore also the sensors 
    of the bow visor locking devices should have been megger tested once a year.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The correct 
    functioning of sensors/indicator lights are a pre-condition for the seaworthiness 
    of the vessel. (This was confirmed by the B.V. head office Paris.)<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The manual 
    locking devices of the bow visor were "heavy weather securings" which had 
    to be applied when heavy weather was forecasted. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) Inspections 
    by the Maritime Administration - F.B.N.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The organisation 
    of F.B.N. has already been explained in Subchapter 2.4.4. Reportedly it did 
    not change very much during the following years. The role of the F.B.N. (and 
    also Sjöfartsverket) Ship Safety Inspectors, whilst it was trading under Finnisg 
    flag, was basically to</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Examine all certificates</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Inspect social 
      rooms/cabins/passengers accommodations</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Inspect lifesaving 
      and fire-fighting equipment </font></li>

      instruments </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Issue (PSSC) 
      Passenger Ship Safety Certificate annually), and thereby confirming that 
      the vessel meets SOLAS requirements.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As long as the vessel 
    remained under Finnish flag and thus under the responsibility and supervision 
    of the F.B.N. periodical inspections were apparently carried out every 3 months 
    by F.B.N. inspectors, as can be seen from the attached extract of the control 
    file together with inspection certificate and inspection report issued by 
    F.B.N. (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.88.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 3.4.88</a> 
    together with translation). Every year a new PSSC was issued, sometimes just 
    by changing the dates on the previous one.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    the vessel never did create problems from the point of view of the F.B.N. 
    They were not informed by the owners when she was sold. According to the F.B.N. 
    there was no exchange of information/documentation with B.V. before, during 
    or after take-over by the Estonians, because they became aware of the flag 
    and name change only when WASA KING was deleted from the Finnish Register 
    (information H. Valkonen). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) Maintenance</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In principle, 
    the vessel was drydocked every second year, but during the intervals the bottom, 
    the rudders and the propellers were inspected and, if necessary, cleaned by 
    divers.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The hull 
    was at first painted red (VIKING SALLY), subsequently white (SILJA STAR and 
    WASA KING), the underwater ship including the bootop area was coated with 
    INERTA ice-resistant paint - blue. For details reference is made to <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.89.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The moving 
    parts of bow visor and bow ramp including the locking devices and hydraulic 
    cylinders (actuators) were checked weekly and greased monthly. General maintenance 
    and necessary repairs were carried out by MacGregor, Turku.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Occasionally 
    hydraulic pressure hoses and packings were renewed, cracks in the mountings 
    of the lifting cylinders of the bow visor were re-welded by the crew (information: 
    Yngve Röblom, Lars Karlsson), the pockets for the securing bolts of the bow 
    ramp were strengthened by the crew (information: Lars Karlsson).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- According 
    to the boatswain Juhani Luttunen already in 1982 it was noted that the visor 
    was slightly misaligned, i.e. the starboard side stood up by about 1 cm. This 
    resulted in a misalignment of the Atlantic lock arrangement and hence the 
    bolt did not fit anymore. To rectify this, motorman Koivisto changed the position 
    of the lugs on the forepeak deck and also modified the visor lug, but in such 
    a miserable manner that the lugs on the forepeak deck had to be completely 
    renewed. This was done by von Tell AB, Gothenburg. For details see Subchapter 
    3.3 and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.3.83.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 3.3.83</a> 
    - Interview Juhani Luttunen.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As stated 
    above the vessel was, in principle, drydocked every second year, but due to 
    repeated problems with the Cedarvall stern tube seals she had to be drydocked 
    during the intervals to repair these seals. From 1987 onwards the owners' 
    specifications for all dockings, the quotations of the yard and the final 
    repair invoices of the yard, which since that time was always Turku Shipyard, 
    Turku, are available to this 'Group of Experts'. According to the records 
    of International Paint, the suppliers of Inerta Ice Resistant Paint, the vessel 
    was also drydocked in May 1985 at Valmet Shipyard/Helsinki, where the duck 
    tail was fitted. These records are attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- After a strong 
    ice-winter, probably in 1985/86, at sea water was noted in the visor up to 
    the outside water level. As it turned out that this condition did not improve 
    notably after renewal of the rubber packings and that the water caused a short-circuit 
    in the mechanical sensors of the Atlantic lock, which also affected other 
    installations on the car deck, the mechanical sensors were replaced by watertight 
    magnetic limit switches.<br>
    Lars Karlsson - chief engineer of the vessel for 12 years - stated in respect 
    of <b>rubber packings</b> and the exchange of the <b>mechanical sensors</b> 
    to <b>magnetic limit switches</b> the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The rubber 
      packings of the visor were changed once a year. The packings were mainly 
      damaged on A-deck and ca. 1 m upwards the front bulkheads because the final 
      movement before closure is backwards - not downwards - which destroys the 
      packings due to the rubbing effect. Therefore we did put grease (same as 
      used for the hinges) on the packings and it became better.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At 
      some time, probably after the strong ice winter 1986/87, we increasingly 
      had problems with electrical failures, short circuits, etc. with the sensors 
      for the indicator lights of the Atlantic lock. So I checked with other vessels, 
      e.g. VIKING SONG and VIKING SAGA and also the market, and finally bought 
      rather expensive magnetic limit switches, which were installed by electrician 
      Sjögren and we never had problems again. I have been many times with B.V. 
      surveyor Lars-Olof Ålander inside the closed visor when water or light test 
      was made during Load Line survey. I believe that at the same time also the 
      indicator lights were checked.« </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The statement of 
    Lars Karlsson is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.5.60.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.5.60</a>. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    information obtained from Håkan Karlsson/Charles Richardson the rubber packings 
    in way of visor and bow ramp were last renewed by the crew during the lay-up 
    time end of 1990/beginning 1991 before SILJA STAR was renamed WASA KING and 
    nothing was done thereafter until the sale in mid January 1993. Consequently 
    at the time of the take-over the same rubber packings, respectively their 
    remains, were in place which had been renewed at the end of 1990. Therefore 
    the last Finnish crew, when preparing the next yard time scheduled for January 
    1993, had asked for renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of the visor 
    and 10 m in way of the bow ramp.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In winter it was 
    frequently very difficult to open the frozen visor despite the two ice-cylinders 
    assisting the opening procedure. Lars Karlsson reports in this respect: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»In winter we 
      had problems to open the visor.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It 
      is easy to increase the pressure by just turning a wheel at the hydraulic 
      pump (axial piston pump - make: Vickers). There was a lock nut to regulate 
      the pressure.<br>
      In case of difficulties to open the visor, e.g. due to it being frozen, 
      it is the easiest thing to increase the hydraulic pressure.»</font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
      (Statement Lars Karlsson - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.5.60.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      2.4.5.60</a>.)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The lower parts 
    of the visor were subject to considerable wear, i.e. from the outside due 
    to ice contact and from the inside due to the continuous change between seawater/air 
    as well as additionally to the "sloshing effect" caused by the water moving 
    forward/aft and side to side, comparable to a partly filled tank. The outside 
    was coated with ice-resistant paint (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.89.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    3.4.89</a>) which could be renewed only during the annual overhaul at the 
    yard. Therefore the ice damaged parts of the coating were painted over with 
    normal blue paint at the end of the ice season. As the lower part of the visor 
    was difficult to access the electrical blocking between visor and bow ramp 
    was manipulated by the electrician in such a way that the visor could be lowered 
    whilst the bow ramp was open. Thus the bottom and lower part of visor were 
    accessible for maintenance work. According to Håkan Karlsson during the time 
    as VIKING SALLY little or no maintenance work was carried out on the visor 
    inside. Lars Karlsson:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Although it 
      should be impossible due to the electrical system the visor can be closed 
      if the ramp is open when the valves are operated manually. In case the rails 
      of the ramp should be deformed this is due to the lowered down visor for 
      working purposes.«</i></font></p>

    routine inspection Lars Karlsson reports:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»After every 
      stormy cruise I inspected all the parts in the bow area. Four times a year 
      I inspected in detail all safety relevant parts. This included visual inspection 
      of the visor hinges, its weldings, etc. and also the inside of the visor 
      including locking devices and its welding seams.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During 
      one such inspection I found cracks in way of the foundations of the hydraulic 
      cylinders for the bow ramp bolts which were of fatigue nature and not due 
      to overload. We welded strengthening plates to the foundations to stop the 
      crack development.<br>
      Probably in 1990 we had to change the spherical bearing of the port lifting 
      cylinder and after that experienced twice that the Nirosta bolt of the port 
      visor hinges broke the outer securing plate screws and moved out by ca. 
      1 cm. This was noted by the deck officer being on forecastle deck for berthing 
      because he found the broken off screws. The bolt was hammered back into 
      position, the screw holes in the steel bushing drilled out and the securing 
      plate refitted. If it would have happened again we would have investigated 
      the cause, however, during my time, it did not occur again.<br>
      We never had greasing problems. Once per month grease was pressed into the 
      bolts.<br>

    speed of the oil flow could be regulated. This had to be absolutely identical 
    on both sides, otherwise one side would open or close faster than the other 
    side and the visor would get out of alignment. These regulating valves were 
    fitted at the outside of the lifting cylinders at their lower side, i.e. at 
    B-deck level (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.4.79.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

    was known on board that the vessel would be sold the mates and engineers drew 
    up the repair specification, i.e. what they considered necessary to be repaired 
    during the next scheduled yard time in January 1993. (The vessel had last 
    been in the Yard in January 1991.) The copy received from Turku Repair Yard 
    after the first Stockholm Exhibition in August 1997 was typed in Swedish with 
    handwritten remarks and quoted prices in Finnish. The date "25.09.92" is handwritten 
    on page 1 as well as the Finnish words "Telakuinti Turussa" which means "Docking 
    in Turku". The repair items start with 1. and ends with 65.26 whereafter 6 
    items are specified under the heading "Sundry", which read - office translated 
    - as follows:</font></p>

    by MacGregor, which is attached - with office translation - as Enclosure 3.4.98.

    questioned after the ESTONIA casualty by the criminal police, Turku in the 
    presence of Dr. Tuomo Karppinnen of the Finnish part of the JAIC and mentioned 
    nothing whatsoever about the above repair specification and his own quotation

    that the owners (Wasa Line) were then of the opinion that the port and starboard 
    outer hinge bearings including bolts were in September 1992 in such a bad 
    condition that replacement was necessary. Actually absolutely nothing was 
    done to these hinges up to the sinking of the ESTONIA nor was evidently anything 
    done to rectify the other items mentioned under "Sundry" in the initial repair 
    specification. According to the Turku Repair Yard and the two attached invoices 
    No. 31554 to Wasa Line -<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.4.102.htm" target="_blank">

      to strengthen one of the locking devices of the visor already sometime before. 
      This was therefore now the second time that the mates and the engineers 
      having sailed on this vessel for many years were asking for the locking 
      devices of visor and bow ramp to be strengthened. The complete statement

      closed (Enclosure 3.4.104 - photo showing bow area). Owners took the opportunity 
      to have the renewed plating of the 1st strake above the ice-strengthened 
      part increased to 20 mm. Survey reports, repair invoices, and damage photos 
      are available at Alandia Insurance Company, Mariehamn. According to B.V.
