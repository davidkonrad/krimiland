  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><font size="2">The vessel 
    was rolling softly in beam sea, but pitching hard in head sea and took over 
    lots of spray water, the speed had to be reduced in time before green water 
    was taken on the forecastle (visor).</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was 
    reacting sensitively to beam wind, took up quickly permanent heel, e.g. Beaufort 
    6 - 7 from port side would create a starboard list of 2°- 3°.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The anchors were 
    sitting tight in the pockets. No banging was heard when the vessel was pitching 
    in head seas.</font></li>

  Proceeding through ice</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On the route 
    from Turku to Stockholm ice is usually met more frequently and longer compared 
    to the route Tallinn-Stockholm, because the ice inside the archipelago grows 
    faster and disappears later. If, however, the Gulf of Finland respectively 
    the Baltic is covered by ice the route Tallinn-Stockholm is much more difficult 
    and problematic in comparison to proceeding through ice in the archipelago, 
    because the ice at sea is much heavier and thicker. The ice moves with wind 
    and/or current, ice channels open and close quickly, wind and current press 
    the ice floes together and on top of each other, thereby creating ice barriers 
    of several meters thickness.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The maximum speed 
    when proceeding at sea through ice should not exceed 7-8 knots, whereby the 
    ice pressure on the visor should always be the decisive factor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The risk of sustaining 
    severe damage to the bow area and to the under-water hull, however, is most 
    imminent if the Gulf of Finland and/or the Baltic Sea are jointly partly covered 
    by ice and the bridge is manned by inexperienced navigators. The vessel then 
    quickly picks up speed in free water and subsequently crashes with high speed 
    into ice fields, thereby colliding with thick and solid ice floes. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also SOLAS requires 
    the early and substantial reduction of speed near ice according to Chapter 
    V, Regulation 7, a copy of which is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/3.2.3.82.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 3.2.3.82.</a></font></li>

  history</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In the initial 
    trading area of VIKING SALLY between Turku-Mariehamn-Stockholm the ferry never 
    proceeded more than 14 nm from the nearest land, thus never left sheltered 
    waters. Nevertheless according to Håkan Karlsson, one of the two long-term 
    masters of the ferry, they experienced a couple of times hurricane force winds 
    on the way to the Söderarm entrance when they had to hove-to for the safety 
    of the ferry. Also in her subsequent trading areas in the Gulf of Bothnia 
    between Vaasa and Sundsvall she met rough weather frequently according to 
    her long-term chief engineer Lars Karlsson and the engine output was reduced 
    repeatedly. Upon request of this 'Group of Experts' the Swedish Meteorological 
    and the Hydrological Institute (SMHI) has studied the available weather and 
    wave data to find out how often ESTONIA had met at least the same wind and 
    wave conditions as she did during the casualty night. <br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    result is that in the Gulf of Bothnia she has met similar conditions only 
    once, viz. on 19 December 1992. (For details see Subchapter 12.2.) </font></p>

  Boatswain Juhani Luttunen</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Juhanni Luttunen 
    had been one of the two boatswains of the vessel from June 1980 to November 
    1992, while Christer Koivisto had been motorman and "ombudsman" at the same 
    time.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Luttunen, 
    who shot Koivisto on 12 June 1996, was interviewed in the prison of Vaasa 
    by a member of this 'Group of Experts' and has stated the following:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>His function 
    as boatswain in connection with operating the visor/bow ramp was to stand 
    at the control panel. </i></font></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He explained 
    the different handles and also the indicator lights. - He remembered clearly 
    the 2 hooks and 4 bolts of the bow ramp as well as</font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the hydraulic 
    side locks, the Atlantic lock, and also explained that they had never engaged 
    the manual side locks.</font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At some time 
    probably in 1982 it was realised that the visor was no more closing properly 
    because it was in a misaligned condition athwartships. He thinks that the 
    starboard corner was standing a bit up. It was for this reason that the Atlantic 
    lock bolt could no more move through the visor lug. The matter was discussed 
    with the engine crew and it was considered what could be done. </font></i></li>
  <li><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Engine repairman 
    Koivisto considered himself to be the visor expert and offered to rectify 
    the Atlantic lock to the effect that the bolt would fit again. Luttunen remembers 
    that Koivisto was even called back from vacation to do the modification.</font></i> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>In the presence 
    of Luttunen and motorman Göran Lindström Koivisto cut off the upper part of 
    the lugs of the Atlantic lock and took off the bushings. Thereafter he welded 
    extended parts on the lug remains and the holes in the lugs now looked like 
    an ellipse, the bushings did not fit any more and were left out as still the 
    bolt would not go smoothly through the visor lug, which was extending apparently 
    too much aft or too much forward. In any event Koivisto cut something off 
    the inside of the visor lug, whereby Luttunen is of the opinion that it was 
    from the forward part.<br>
    </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After 
    the repairs were completed they realised at once that it was impossible and 
    decided to contact the inspector ashore. The poor modification was inspected 
    and about one week later Swedish speaking people came from the company von 
    Tell AB, cut off completely all 3 lugs of the Atlantic lock and welded new 
    ones to the A-deck with bushings inserted.<br>
    He believes also that it was then realised that there was something wrong 
    with the hydraulic, which was adjusted. The visor lug remained - as far as 
    he remembers - unchanged, i.e. should still be the original.<br>
    When the repairs were completed the von Tell people expressly prohibited Koivisto 
    or anybody else on board to ever manipulate the Atlantic lock again.</font></i></li>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The statement of 
    Juhani Luttunen that the Atlantic lock was replaced sometime in 1982/83 by 
    Swedish speaking people, most probably from von Tell AB, was basically confirmed 
    by Captain Håkan Karlsson having been Master of VIKING SALLY, SILJA STAR and 
    WASA KING since commissioning of the vessel in 1980.</font></p>
