<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel participated 
    in the "Continuous Class Survey System" for Hull and Machinery (CSH/CSM) of 
    Bureau Veritas and was inspected in regular intervals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 3rd period of 
    class for hull and machinery was running from 3 July 1990. Therefore, the 
    next due date for completion of this Class Renewal III would have been 15 
    July 1995. The last drydocking was in Turku/Finland in January 1994, when 
    inter alia the periodical bottom survey was carried out and the stabilisers 
    were installed as per Hull Survey Report STK/94/3 A - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.205.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    16.1.205.</a> The last annual survey was carried out from 23rd to 25th August 
    1994 while the ferry was in service. No remarks about deficiencies affecting 
    the class were noted in any of the reports by the attending surveyor Anders 
    Wirstam - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.206.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    16.1.206</a> - Survey Statements STK/94/77A-F dated 25.08.94 - see also the 
    previous Chapter 15. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As part of this survey 
    the following items were checked and apparently found to be to the surveyor's 
    satisfaction:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hull and its 
    closing appliances, as far as can be seen; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The anchoring and 
    mooring equipment, as far as practicable;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> All watertight 
    doors in watertight bulkheads including testing locally and remote, as far 
    as practicable;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The watertight 
    bulkhead penetrations, as far as practicable.</font> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the ferry 
      had been taken over by her new owners, Estline AB - c/o Nordström & Thulin, 
      Stockholm - in January 1993, Bureau Veritas was also authorised by the Government 
      of Estonia to issue Safety Certificates pursuant to the following conventions

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    reasons for the L.L. Certificate having been issued "interim" only were</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the "temporary" 
      stability booklet which was not approved by B.V. (on behalf of the Estonian 
      Board of Navigation); <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the too 
      small cross-flooding valve between the heeling tanks.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The reason why the 
    PSSC was issued wrongly was the fact that the vessel did not comply with the 
    requirements of SOLAS 1974 for the "intended trade", i.e. proceeded more than 
    20 nm from the nearest land, as stated annually in the "Survey Report for 
    the Issue for PSSC - Clause 1 - General Information" and, thus, the bow ramp 
    plus front bulkheads, as upper extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead 
    deck = car deck, were ca. 5.8 m too much forward (see Subchapter 2.4.4 above). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last issued L.L. 
    Certificate had already expired on 11.09.94 and apparently a further interim 
    one had not been issued by B.V. for reasons unknown to this 'Group of Experts'. 
    In any event, according to the certificates issued after the surveys carried 
    out between the 23-25 August 1994 by Anders Wirstam, the Load Line Survey 
    was apparently carried out and Annex A - to Report No. STK/94/77E - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/16.1.206.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    16.1.206</a> - was filled out although, as it looks, no new Interim L.L. Certificate 
    had been issued by the time of the casualty. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">This was, at least, the 
    situation in October/November 1994, since it has to be assumed that N&T would 
    have submitted the L.L. Certificate valid at the time of sinking, had they 
    had it. However, when the Final Report of the Joint Accident Investigation 
    Commission was published, it was most surprising to note that they stated 
    on page 46, item 3.6.2 that there had been a valid L.L. Certificate issued 
    on 9 September 1994. In any event, also this certificate was issued falsely 
    because visor and bow ramp had been leaking for many months before the casualty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Based on the status of the 
    class and safety certificates only, it could be assumed that the vessel ESTONIA 
    was in an acceptable condition when she departed from Tallinn on 27 September 
    1994. This, however, was definitely not the case as will be demonstrated in 
    the following subchapters</font>.</p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3"><a name="2"></a>16.2<br>
    Condition of the Bow Area</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the information 
    contained in the previous chapters 3.5 and 12 regarding the vessel's performance 
    until 27 September 1994, in particular the various observations of passengers, 
    crew members and other persons on or from the car deck or other decks of the 
    ferry, it has to be concluded that </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(1) the visor, 
    its locking devices (hinges) and rubber packings;<br>
    </b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) 
    the bow ramp, its locking devices, hinges and rubber packings</font></b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    had been in a very bad condition respectively were non-existent when the ferry 
    commenced her last voyage on the evening of 27 September 1994.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This conclusion 
    is in direct contradiction to the statements made by Bureau Veritas in the 
    many certificates issued by them in respect of all the safety relevant parts 
    of the vessel and it is indeed the question on what basis these certificates 
    have been issued.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Before the observed 
    deficiencies shall be explained in detail the relevant parts of the foreship, 
    which played a crucial role in the casualty sequence-of-events, shall be shown

    (1) The visor, its hinges, locking devices and rubber packings: </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In detail:<br>
    The problems with the visor were initiated by two different circumstances, 
    viz. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- severe structural damage 
    caused by proceeding through heavy ice at excessive speed.<br>
    - the decision of the Technical Managers, N&T, not to renew the rubber packings, 
    assuring weather(water-)tightness of the visor and preventing the visor from 
    vibrating and thereby avoiding cracks emanating therefrom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Structural damage:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The shell plating 
    as well as the internals are very severely damaged in two places, viz. there 
    is a deep vertical indentation in the bow leading upwards from the stempost 
    for about 2 m, as can be seen on the picture below from the outside,</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg385.jpg" width="252" height="218"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The arrow points 
    to the deep indentation which is completely painted and the paint does not 
    show contact marks. The following photos showing the inside of the same area 
    do confirm the deep indentation in a very strong part of the visor to be of 
    old origin. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg386.jpg" width="367" height="551"></font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Furthermore, the 
    shell plating as well as the 3rd stringer at the port side are severely indented 
    and set up with the frames buckled which had been sustained already some time 
    before the casualty. - See the pictures above.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The condition of 
    the visor bottom with stempost is evident from the picture below taken on 
    30.08.94.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg387.jpg" width="405" height="372"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 1</b> - 
    Indentation in the foremost part of the visor bottom indicating that the visor's 
    initial position was changed to forward most probably due to misalignment 
    of the whole structure. This led to contact between the visor bottom and the 
    stempost on the forepeak deck. Since the visor bottom in this area is not 
    constructed to take up load, the bottom became indented and cracked. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 2</b> - 
    Indicates a cracked welding seam through which water penetrated and created 
    the rust stripes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Arrow 3 </b>- 
    Indicates transverse cracks in the visor bottom in way of the contact area 
    with the starboard steel pad welded to the forepeak deck and which should 
    take up about 10% of the visor's weight in closed condition. Since the corresponding 
    port side is not affected at all, it has to be assumed that the starboard 
    side absorbs all the weight which is another indication for the complete misalignment 
    of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Arrow 4 </b>- 
    Indicates a further probably cracked area.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    above it has to be concluded that the visor was completely misaligned in longitudinal, 
    transverse and vertical direction which led to considerable problems during 
    opening and closing. These problems increased all the more as time went by 
    as confirmed by the many observations, e.g. of previous passengers, in particular 
    the truck drivers having spent hours on the car deck waiting for the crew 
    to be able to open the visor (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The difficulties 
    with the visor are also confirmed by previous crew members and pilots having 
    observed the frequent opening and violent closing until the locating horn 
    on the forepeak deck (pyramid) finally fitted into the mating pocket in the 
    visor bottom (see Subchapter 12.4.3 above).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Consequences of 
    the misaligned visor</b><br>
    Due to the increasing misalignment it was at first difficult to close the 
    locking devices and subsequently to open them. <br>
    Reportedly it had not been possible to open and close the <b>Atlantic lock</b> 
    hydraulically for several months prior to the casualty and the crew members 
    had to go inside the visor before arrival and after departure from Tallinn 
    and hammer open respectively closed the bolt of the Atlantic lock which, among 
    other things affected the load-carrying capacity of the lugs. Also the <b>hydraulic 
    side locks </b>were difficult to close and subsequently to open. Reportedly 
    on many occasions after arrival in Tallinn the lugs had to be cut off the 
    visor by flame-cutting to be able to open the visor. Subsequently the lugs 
    were rewelded to the visor bulkheads which continuously reduced the load-carrying 
    capacity of these lugs (see Subchapter 12.4.3. and Chapter 30).<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Obviously also 
    the <b>visor hinges</b> had become affected because on 17 September 1994, 
    i.e. 10 days before the last departure, a passenger filmed the visor and, 
    in particular, the starboard visor hinges in Tallinn during the closing procedure.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The passenger 
    was standing in front of deck 7 and filmed the closing of the visor, finally 
    zooming in on the starboard hinges. The video-prints below are part of the 
    film. Picture 2 is an enlargement of Picture 1.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On Picture 2 there 
    are obviously several major deficiencies visible, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the gap between 
    the starboard vessel hinge plate and the outer bushing is much too large (arrow 
    1). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the outer bushing 
    is sticking much too far out of the outer visor hinge plate (arrow 2) [which 
    explains the large gap mentioned above]. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) the lower part 
    of outer bushing is missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the securing 
    plate is missing and the outer end of the bolt is not visible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(e) the outer bushing 
    appears to be twisted anti-clockwise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(f) the inner bushing 
    appears to be twisted clockwise.<br>
    See also Subchapters 12.4.3, 12.5 and Chapter 30. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates 
    that the steel- and bronze-bushings of the starboard visor hinge arrangement 
    had been replaced some time ago in a very unpro-fessional way with an extremely 
    poor standard of workmanship.<br>
    Also the member of a working team, the nautical student Rain Oolmets, who 
    stayed on board from 15 July to 11 September 1994, had discovered cracks in 
    the welding seams up to 10 cm long between the steel bushings and the visor 
    hinge plates of the port and starboard visor hinge arrangements which underlines 
    the generally poor condition of these safety relevant components. See Subchapter 
    12.5.<br>
    It is obvious from the above description of the visible deficiencies that 
    the <b>condition of the visor hinges rendered the vessel already initially 
    unseaworthy. </b></font></p>

    missing rubber packings<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The last 
    Finnish crew had requested the renewal of 15 m of rubber packing in way of 
    the visor for the then planned yard time in January 1993, because the rubber 
    packing had last been renewed in January 1991. This meant a renewal of the 
    entire packing on the forepeak deck plus about 2 m up each front bulkhead 
    as demonstrated by the following drawing. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the new technical 
    managers N&T were of the opinion that visors are full of water at sea anyway, 
    the rubber packings were not renewed in January 1993 and also not later. This 
    means that the visor became quickly filled up with water at sea up to the 
    height of the outside water level. In calm sea it was the height of the bow 
    wave which filled the visor up to the 3rd stringer, however, the worse the 
    weather was and the deeper the bow was diving into the waves, the higher the 
    water rose inside the visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following 
    picture shows the ESTONIA in Tallinn, with open visor but closed bow ramp 
    so that the otherwise invisible underside of the bow ramp is shown with the 
    lowest section being dark - see arrow. Doubtless this was caused by the water 
    inside the visor with hydraulic oil from the leaking cylinders swimming on 
    top of the water surface. When the vessel reduced speed and the bow wave became 
    smaller and finally disappeared completely when the vessel was alongside, 
    the water streamed out of the visor and the oil settled everywhere inside 
    the visor, also on the bow ramp which forms the aft inside of the visor. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The water streaming 
    out of the visor was observed by many passengers when the vessel was alongside 
    in Stockholm with closed visor and, among others, also by the skipper of the 
    Sandhamn pilot boat as well as by several pilots when the ferry was</font> 
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">slowing down during 
    the approach to the pilot boat. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bow wave became 
    smaller and the water streamed at once out of the visor. (See Subchapter 12.4.4.) 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is obvious 
    that at sea inside the visor the conditions in a partly filled ballast water 
    tank did exist with resultant sloshing effects causing additional loads on 
    hinges and locking devices and vibrations to the whole visor, the consequences 
    of which are described in Subchapter 34.3.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(2) The bow ramp, 
    its locking devices, hinges and rubber packings:<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The<b> 
    bow ramp</b> was part of the upper extension of the collision bulkhead above 
    bulkhead deck and as such had to be mandatorily watertight based on the stringent 
    requirements of SOLAS 1974. This, however, was obviously not the case because 
    back to December 1993 there is reliable evidence that frequently there had 
    been a lot of water on the car deck - see Subchapter 12.4.4. There is also 
    a lot of evidence that the bow ramp was severely misaligned and - in fact 
    - was no more connected to the port outer and probably also inner hinges for 
    some time - see Subchapter 12.4.3. It has thus to be assumed that the water 
    penetrated onto the car deck from the visor, which was filled up to the outside 
    water level, as soon as the vessel was on full speed and the bow wave had 
    risen to ca. 2.5 m height. Since even in calm sea the visor was filled above 
    the level of the 3rd stringer, which is above the car deck level, it is apparent 
    that even in good weather conditions water was streaming onto the car deck. 
    Most of it was most probably absorbed by the 12 scuppers at each side, some 
    of which, however, were reportedly always blocked by stones and other debris.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    <b>Consequently it has to be assumed that there was already a deadly connection 
    between the always water-filled and -refilled visor and the large, open car 
    deck via the open port lower </b>edge of the bow ramp since some time before 
    the last departure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The <b>locking devices 
    of the bow ramp</b> were difficult to lock and, once locked, even more difficult 
    to unlock. There is lots of evidence from truck drivers and other passengers 
    having waited for hours on the car deck watching the fruitless attempts to 
    open respectively close the securing bolts hydraulically and, finally, watching 
    them being opened by flame cutting of the upper parts of the mating boxes, 
    which should have been subsequently rewelded but frequently were not. When 
    the crew did not succeed in closing the bolts hydraulically, they tried it 
    by hammering, even by using sledge-hammers and very often gave up, i.e. the 
    ramp remained - at least partly - unsecured! (See Subchapters 12.4.3 / 12.4.5.)<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this led, 
    of course, in time to a considerable reduction of the load-carrying capacity 
    similar as with the hydraulic side locks of the visor. Also <b>the hinges 
    of the bow ramp </b>were severely affected, in particular the <b>port outer 
    hinge</b>. This very heavy hinge arrangement was already damaged before the 
    vessel was taken over by her new owners in January 1993, because the old Finnish 
    crew had already requested renewal at the planned yard time in January 1993 
    - see Subchapter 6.5.1. Nothing was done by N&T and since the mates of the 
    ESTONIA performed the loading and discharging of the cars and trucks reportedly 
    rather carelessly, the vessel very often had a list during loading or unloading 
    which finally broke the port hinge completely according to the report of a 
    truck driver being an eye witness. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The crew had 
    severe problems to lift up the ramp at all which was only possible after some 
    temporary measurements had been carried out. Ever since, the misalignment 
    of the ramp increased visibly and the problems were growing daily.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the <b>rubber 
    packings</b> around the car deck opening, which should be sealed tight by 
    a properly closed and locked bow ramp, apparently did no more seal watertight 
    since some considerable time already, because the last Finnish crew had ordered<b> 
    10 m of rubber packing to be renewed </b>at the next yard time which was planned 
    for January 1993 - see Subchapter 3.4. - as mentioned before. This was more 
    than half of the total length of the rubber packings, but also these packings 
    were never renewed. </font></p>
