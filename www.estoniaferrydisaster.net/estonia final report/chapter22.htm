  The Distress Communication</b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ESTONIA was equipped, 
    in compliance with the old system, with a radio-telegraphy station and a radio-telephone 
    system. The radio installation and the competence of those serving it satisfied 
    the SOLAS Requirements. In addition, there were some 30-35 portable VHF maritime 
    radio-telephones (walkie-talkies) available to particular crew members which 
    were not indicated in the vessel's radio licence. These VHF-sets could also 
    communicate on channel 16. It is obvious that the transmission power of such 
    VHF-sets is much less than the power of the permanent VHF-installations on 
    the bridge with antennas on top of the mast. As parts of the 'Mayday' transmissions 
    were received very weakly and partly interrupted, it has to be assumed that 
    the mates used their walkie-talkies. Also the many disturbances on channel 
    16 during this time might have played a role.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It cannot, therefore, 
    be excluded that those on the bridge had already tried to get out a 'Mayday 
    message' much earlier. The anonymous information from an A.B. sailor of a 
    large Swedish ferry in the vicinity of the casualty, who called during the 
    "Efterlys"*) TV program in summer 1996 might be a confirmation for this assumption.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> -------------------<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="1">*) "Efterlys" 
    is a Swedish TV program comparable to the German program "Akten-zeichen XY 
    ungelöst" which presents unsolved criminal cases to the public.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The sailor reported 
    that they had heard a very weak 'Mayday' from the ESTONIA already about 30 
    minutes before the 'Mayday' at 01.22 hours which finally triggered off the 
    rescue operation. They had not reacted because it had been very weak and was 
    not repeated, at least they did not hear anything more and other ferries were 
    much closer. When it subsequently turned out that ESTONIA was really in trouble, 
    he and the mate decided to remain silent about the first weak 'Mayday'. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore the 
    first official 'Mayday' was recorded by the Marine Rescue Coordinating Centre 
    (MRCC) Turku, also very weak and very strange, at</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>01.21.55</b></font><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>"Mayday, 
    Mayday Estonia, please." </i></font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This in itself already 
    implies the urgent request to (finally) being heard, under-stood and helped. 
    Also on the bridge of the Swedish ferry SILJA SYMPHONY this 'Mayday' was heard 
    and the watch A.B. sailor Jan Öhrn started the tape recorder, thus the subsequent 
    distress communication is fully recorded and the respective transcript, already 
    translated into English, is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/22.1.365.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    22.1.365. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The actual 
    distress traffic under participation of the ESTONIA was very short, only 8 
    minutes, and according to the recordings of MRCC Turku reads as follows:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The statement 
        of Andres Tammes was wrong in some respects, viz. (a) at 01.24 hours the 
        list was at least 50°-60° and therefore they had a blackout of most consumers, 
        because after the auxiliaries shut off at a list of 40°-45° the emergency 
        generator only supplies power to a restricted number of consumers to which 
        the GPS Navigator should have belonged (was installed subsequently and 
        is thus unknown to the yard);</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) even if the 
        GPS Navigator had not been connected to the emergency generator's power 
        supply, it still would have shown the last position for the following 
        15 minutes. Consequently, Andres Tammes cannot have been right in explaining 
        his inability to provide the position with 'blackout'. Rather, it has 
        to be assumed that he was unable to look at the GPS Navigator from the 
        position inside the bridge where he was desperately holding fast to something 
        at the high port side, probably near the aft door. In this connection 
        it has to be borne in mind that - straight after the end of the distress 
        communication at 01.25 hrs. Tammes and Ainsalu left the bridge through 
        the port aft door (statement Henrik Sillaste), and - at 01.25 hrs.</font></p>

      After this I got in contact with the ESTONIA. The conversa-tion was initially 
      in English and then the guy on the ESTONIA asked if I spoke Finnish. I answered 
      in the affirmative and after that we continued in Finnish. ESTONIA reported 
      a bad 20°-30° list and asked for help. These details have been recorded 
      in the SILJA EUROPA's radio log and in the ship's log. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      Mayday was received but after that the guy on the ESTONIA was unable to 
      give his position. I got the information that they had a complete black 
      out on the ESTONIA. I called ESTONIA again and managed to reach them. This 
      time the ESTONIA gave me their position which was 59° 22' N and 21° 48' 
      E. The SILJA EUROPA's position at that stage was 59° 32' N and 21° 28' E. 
      After this I called the Master to the bridge and myself started navigating 
      towards the area indicated by the ESTONIA. Simultaneously I started up more 
      engines in order to have full speed.«</font></i></p>

    Viking Line ferry MARIELLA the mate Ingmar Hans-Göran Eklund was on watch 
    and he reports in his statement, which is only available in Swedish, as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The wind was 
      quite strong and blowing from WSW with 16-17 m/sec. The sea was rough and 
      spray was over the whole vessel. Our speed was about 11-13 kn. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When 
      I took over the watch at 22.00 hours I saw the ESTONIA at port side about 
      30° forward of abeam. I saw SILJA EUROPA further ahead of us at starboard 
      side. ESTONIA was proceeding faster than we were, I saw once by the vector 
      that their speed was 14.3 kn which is the highest speed I would have dared 
      during this night. I estimate that the average speed on ESTONIA was 14 kn. 
      Her course at 22.00 hours was almost West and she was holding herself quite 
      well at our side. We steered a little more to the West to have the wind 
      from right ahead, which was westerly. <br>
      I saw ESTONIA all the time on the radar. I had a vector every 15 minutes. 
      <br>
      At 01.30 hours the master, Captain Thörnroos phoned the bridge and asked 
      how the weather was. I replied something like the vessel's pitching and 
      at the same time I heard on Channel 16 that ESTONIA said one time 'Mayday'. 
      I think that the following words were "blackout" and "heavy listing". I 
      asked the master to come up and that's what he did. I replied immediately 
      to ESTONIA but they did not answer. Also after the master had come up to 
      the bridge I continu-ously tried to get contact but ESTONIA did not answer. 
      Simul-taneously with my attempts to establish contact with ESTONIA I took 
      her radar position ..... .<br>
      As soon as the master was on the bridge we altered course towards ESTONIA. 
      The distance was ca. 9 nm when he called 'Mayday'. We could even see ESTONIA 
      visually. Earlier many times I had looked at her through binoculars and 
      knew her silhouette quite well.<br>
      After we had heard the 'Mayday' call we saw the lights of ESTONIA. While 
      I was taking care of the navigation, the master was trying to get in contact 
      with Helsinki Radio, first over VHF and then on MF 2182 kHz, both of which 
      failed. He finally managed to get in contact with the shore by mobile phone.«</font></i></p>

    22.1.376</a> - it has to be assumed that the statements of the operators on 
    duty at MRCC Turku, Ilkka Jouko Kalevi Kärppälä, and at the Coast Guard station 
    Nagu/Pärnäs, Rauli Tapio Winberg, must be wrong. Reportedly it had been admitted 
    in the media that the Mayday calls were recorded automatically, but that actually 
    nobody had been on watch at these stations and that this is the explanation 
    why nobody reacted at the beginning (see also the following Subchapter 22.3 
    - The Rescue Operation). The above might be the explanation for the initial 
    silence of the Finnish MRCCs, but what about Sweden and Estonia?<br>
    <b>Note</b>:According to Finnish media reports both stations were unattended

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also the following 
    two questions are difficult to answer. It shall, nevertheless, be attempted:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) Why was the 
      Mayday transmitted so late?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (2) Why did SILJA 
      EUROPA and MARIELLA insist on establishing ESTONIA's position, although 
      they knew exactly that the vessel between them and somewhat more to the 
      South was ESTONIA? (These 3 ferries had been arriving at and sailing from 
      Stockholm together since February 1993). This refers in particular to MARIELLA 
      because those on the bridge saw ESTONIA continuously since being overtaken 
      by her off Hangö an the watch officers established her position immediately 
      after they heard the 'Mayday'.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to 1.) :</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the investigation 
    results of this 'Group of Experts' question one might be explained as follows:<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has been 
    mentioned already at the beginning of this subchapter that the transmissions 
    had been very weak for two reasons, viz.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the mates most 
      probably had used their 'walkie-talkies', and <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Channel 
      16 was considerably disturbed. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Therefore it cannot 
    be excluded and has to be assumed that a 'Mayday' had been called earlier 
    already. This is confirmed, on one hand, by the anonymous telephone report 
    of a watch A.B. on a ferry in the vicinity and, secondly, by the circumstances 
    on board which had mandatorily required the 'Mayday' at the very latest after 
    the big heel at 01.02 hours. The indication of Silver Linde in his statement 
    no. 3 on 17.10.94 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.2.255.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.2.255</a>), that he was sent down from the bridge to inform them about 
    the alarm to the Information desk minutes before the big heel, could confirm 
    this as could the statement of Henrik Sillaste<b> that the lifeboat lashings 
    had been released in advance.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Furthermore, those 
    on the bridge of ESTONIA had been aware of the following problems: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) The starboard 
      stabiliser which did not move out and a respective alarm had appeared at 
      about 00.30 hours, which activated Margus Treu and was - according to the 
      book of Andi Meister - the real reason to call down Henrik Sillaste, and 
      subsequently Kadak and Sillaste tried to get the stabiliser fin out, probably 
      by beating with a sledge hammer while Treu returned to the ECR. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Margus Treu 
      reported to the bridge that <i>"the bow ramp had been struck and became 
      broke"</i> (that is what Treu told Kadak), most probably after he had seen 
      it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) Silver Linde 
      reported to the bridge that <i>"there is a lot of water on the car deck, 
      we have to leave the vessel"</i> (overheard by Ervin Roden).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It can be assumed 
    with certainty that the watch officer, 2nd officer Peeter Kannussaar, immediately 
    informed the master and chief officer, who certainly came to the bridge probably 
    together with the chief engineer within 2 or 3 minutes maximum. As a next 
    step, the speed was reduced to probably 6 kn (Margus Treu) and the course 
    was slowly changed to starboard with the aim of taking the pressure off the 
    visor and wind and sea on the stern at slow speed and then to send crew members 
    down to the car deck to close the partly open bow ramp. It has to be assumed 
    further that 4th officer Kikas was steering manually during this manoeuvre. 
    When the wind and sea came almost abeam from starboard the vessel began to 
    roll more and more, less to port / wider to starboard and those on the bridge 
    realised that there was the risk of capsizing to starboard and decided to 
    turn back to port. This was apparently done too fast in the attempt to stop 
    the dangerous rolls and the ferry swung rapidly to port and made a wide heel 
    to starboard - reportedly 45°-50° - and came back to almost upright condition. 
    The very abrupt and rapid heel caused numerous people to be catapulted out 
    of their bunks, to be thrown against walls, roulette tables and other heavy 
    objects to be torn loose and smashed against the wall and the like. Therefore 
    it has to be assumed that at the highest point of the superstructure - the 
    bridge - also some or all of those on duty there lost their hold and were 
    catapulted the very long distance across the breadth of the bridge into the 
    starboard wing (where indeed one body was found by the divers). It is not 
    unrealistic to assume that it took them - at least - several minutes to recover, 
    if at all, and then to realise the situation. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It has further 
    to be assumed that 2nd officer (B) Kannussaar, whose watch was over at 01.00 
    hours, was sent down to the car deck, probably together with the nautical 
    adviser Juri Aavik, the chief engineer Lembit Leiger, the boatswain Vello 
    Ruben and some A.B.s, among them Aulis Lee and Aarne Koppel. They were working 
    on the car deck when the two severe impacts occurred around 01.00 hours, shortly 
    afterwards followed by the big starboard heel at 01.02 hours, the vessel righted 
    almost up, but the heel increased again and those on the car deck realised 
    that they had no chance to hold the visor and to close the bow ramp and tried 
    to get up to the bridge, respectively to deck 7. Silver Linde, Aarne Koppel 
    and Aulis Lee made it, they were already on deck 7 opening liferafts when 
    crew members from the cabins on deck 7 came out (the purser Andres Vihmar 
    for example). The passenger Per-Erik Ehrnsten, coming from his cabin on deck 
    6, i.e. only one deck below and located near the forward central stairway, 
    even saw Silver Linde and two other crew members walking in the inner alleyway 
    from the aft crew accommodation forward towards the centre stairway only minutes 
    after the big heel. Aulis Lee even managed to get back to his cabin on the 
    starboard side of deck 4, to pick-up his wife Aina and both got back to deck 
    7 in time and survived. Simultaneously those on the bridge obviously considered 
    their options whilst the situation was deteriorating by the minute, the vessel 
    being now on a south-easterly heading with the deep starboard side exposed 
    to the wind and waves, the main engines shut off, but when the vessel stabilised 
    for some time at a heel of 40°-50° this might have raised hopes for a while 
    that the vessel might stay afloat until the arrival of assistance from shore. 
    This might have caused them to delay the urgently required transmission of 
    'Mayday' and alarm for the passengers even further. When finally at about 
    01.21/01.22 hours the heeling started again to increase 2nd officer Ainsalu 
    desperately called<i> "Mayday, Estonia, please"</i>, etc.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this does 
    not explain why Ainsalu and subsequently also Tammes did not use the bridge 
    installed VHF or even the MF installation being much stronger, which would 
    have connected them with the outside world immediately.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently 
    there must have been circumstances on the bridge which prevented them from 
    using the installations. One reason could be the authority of ESTONIA's master, 
    Arvo Andresson, who never permitted the mates on duty to take any action on 
    their own. Therefore also during this night the mates on the bridge presumably 
    did not dare to undertake on their own such a drastic step as advising the 
    outside world by transmitting a 'Mayday' that the pride of their nation, the 
    ESTONIA, was in serious trouble. Unthinkable according to the philosophy of 
    Arvo Andresson and his superiors ashore, and this could be a reason why the 
    'Mayday' was transmitted so late, i.e. in a situation when main engines and 
    auxiliaries had already shut off automatically and the vessel was heeling 
    at 45°-50° since 01.22 hours.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand, it also cannot be excluded that the mates transmitted a 'Mayday' much 
    earlier, i.e. before 01.00 hours already, but by means of the "walkie-talkies" 
    and at a time when transmissions over Channel 16 were severely affected by 
    heavy disturbances.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As, however, 
    no one from the bridge has survived and the evidence of watch A.B. Silver 
    Linde in respect of his observations on the bridge around 01.00 hours have 
    proven to be wrong, because he never was on the bridge after 00.30 hours, 
    and furthermore the four bodies found on the bridge by the divers were not 
    examined - at least not officially - it will probably never become known what 
    happened on the bridge after 00.30 hours, unless the unmanipulated videos 
    are released and/or new diving investigations are carried out.</font></p>

  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">as to 2.) : </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Why did SILJA EUROPA 
    and MARIELLA insist on establishing ESTONIA's position, although they knew 
    exactly that the vessel between them and somewhat more to the South was ESTONIA? 
    In particular MARIELLA had seen ESTONIA continuously since being overtaken 
    by her off Hangö.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On MARIELLA, 
    only 9 nm away from the casualty, the master Jan-Tore Thörnroos phoned the 
    bridge just at that minute from his bedroom to instruct 2nd officer Ingmar 
    Eklund to further reduce speed as the vessel was pitching in too hard. At 
    that time MARIELLA, being almost twice as large as ESTONIA, was already going 
    several knots slower than the Estonian vessel. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos heard 
    Eklund shouting: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Now Estonia 
      is sending a distress message.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Within less than 
    1 minute Thörnroos appeared barefoot on the bridge. In the meantime Eklund 
    had twice tried to get in contact with ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia - 
      Mariella.«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Estonia - 
      Mariella.« </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The name of the own 
    vessel always has to be mentioned after the name of the vessel being called.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">But there came 
    no answer. Not before 1 minute and 5 seconds later when a sound, as from a 
    whistle, was heard which most probably was a disturbance caused by somebody 
    activating the transmitter on channel 16 without using it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a further 15 
    seconds the desperate voice from ESTONIA came again: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Europa - Estonia 
      - Silja Europa - Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now chief officer 
    Teijo Seppelin from SILJA EUROPA replied directly in English, which is the 
    normal radio communication language in international waters:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this 
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Ainsalu called again 
    as if he had not heard SILJA EUROPA: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Silja Europa.« 
      </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin replied 
    again:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia, this 
      is Silja Europa replying on channel 16.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> He got no reply, 
    21 seconds elapsed before Ainsalu came back:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, 
      Viking - Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now Ainsalu suddenly 
    called both SILJA EUROPA and the undefined Viking apparently not knowing which 
    Viking vessel was the nearest. The master of MARIELLA had meanwhile arrived 
    on the bridge and tried to get in contact with ESTONIA himself:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Estonia, Estonia.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Immediately thereafter 
    came Ainsalu:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Mayday, Mayday.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Two minutes and 
    9 seconds had by now elapsed since the first Mayday. Teijo Seppelin on SILJA 
    EUROPA apparently had difficulties accepting that one of the large Baltic 
    ferries was calling Mayday. He asked again and not fully in line with the 
    international rules for distress traffic by VHF:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Estonia - 
      Silja Europa - asking you - eh. Are calling you Mayday? Estonia, what's 
      going on? Can you reply?« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A correct reply should 
    have been an immediate acknowledgement of the Mayday call and a question for 
    the position. Now a new and somewhat more energetic voice came from the ESTONIA, 
    the 3rd officer Andres Tammes who continued in English:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»This is Estonia.«<br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Then 
      he changed into Finnish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Who is there? 
      Silja Europa, Estonia.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied 
      in English.<br>
      <i> »Yes, Estonia. This is Silja Europa.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, who according 
    to his professional qualifications spoke English, continued in Finnish and 
    now obviously tried to calm down the emotions somewhat by being polite:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Good morning. 
      Do you speak Finnish?«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes,«</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied<br>
      <i>»I speak Finnish.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The further communication 
    between Tammes and Seppelin continued in Finnish. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Yes, we have 
      a problem here now,« <br>
      </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">said 
      Tammes<br>
      <i>»a bad list to the right side. I believe that it is 20°, 30°. Could you 
      come to our assistance and also ask Viking Line to come to our assistance?«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied: 
      <br>
      <i>»Yes, Viking Line is behind us and they surely got the information. Can 
      you give your position?«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes: <br>
      <i>»...(unclear)...we have blackout, we cannot get it now. I cannot say 
      it.« </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin:<br>
      <i>»Okay, understood, we'll take measures.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This was a confusing 
    question from Seppelin and one of the most peculiar ones of the whole rescue 
    operation. These large vessels proceeded on almost the same course every night. 
    SILJA and VIKING departed from Helsinki together at 18.00 hours, while ESTONIA 
    left Tallinn one hour later. All three vessels headed for Sandhamn, where 
    they normally arrived more or less at the same time. Only in strong southerly 
    and south-westerly winds would all three use the northern entrance to Stockholm 
    - Söderarm. They knew exactly where the other vessels were and one look at 
    the radar screen would have told Seppelin where MARIELLA and ESTONIA were. 
    This question to ESTONIA, however, also indicates that he knew where MARIELLA 
    was. Consequently, he should also have been aware that the radar echo on port 
    side aft of abeam was ESTONIA. However, instead of turning SILJA EUROPA soonest 
    towards the already sinking ESTONIA a long discussion via VHF channel 16 commenced 
    about ESTONIA's position. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes 
    from ESTONIA told Teijo Seppelin that they had a 'blackout' which normally 
    means that the power supply has totally failed and thus they were unable to 
    state their position. Both GPS Satellite Navigators installed on the bridge 
    - a "Shipmate" in the control panel and a "Magnavox" in the chartroom - were 
    connected to the emergency generator as well as to the emergency batteries 
    according to the Estonian members of the JAIC. Both GPS Navigators were automatically 
    switched off when the auxiliaries stopped and switched on again after the 
    start of the emergency generator. In order to overlap this break a battery 
    installed in the GPS Navigator supplies power in the meantime and the set 
    remains connected to the chain and shows the position continuously; consequently 
    the position remains on the display, at least of the "Shipmate" GPS. Therefore, 
    this could not have been the reason for Tammes's problem in stating their 
    position. The reason was most probably his difficulties to hold to something 
    at his position in the bridge, most likely at the aft door at port side, because 
    at 01.35 hours when the VHF-communication between Tammes and Seppelin commenced 
    ESTONIA must have heeled ca. 50°-60°, which was quickly increasing, and not 
    20°-30° as stated by Tammes. It was most probably impossible for Tammes from 
    his position to have a look at the "Shipmate" GPS installed in the front console. 
    It took some time for chief mate Juhan Herma to get to the Shipmate from where 
    he had been before inside the bridge and shout the position to Tammes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now the master of 
    MARIELLA came in:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Silja Europa, 
      Mariella.«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Yes, Mariella, 
      Europa here - Mariella on 16.« </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos asked:<br>
      <i>»Yes, listen, is their position clear to you? Is it they who are on our 
      port side?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> More peculiar questions, 
    this time from Captain Thörnroos of MARIELLA. The 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund, 
    who had been on the bridge all the time, was able to inform his master directly 
    which echo on the radar screen belonged to ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»There is Estonia!« 
      </i><br>
      said Eklund and pointed to the lights on the horizon.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In his statement 
    to the Finnish criminal police Captain Thörnroos subsequently also testified 
    that he <i>»saw the lights of Estonia without the help of binoculars.</i>« 
    Eklund had seen ESTONIA overtaking MARIELLA outside Hangö and had followed 
    the radar track ever since. Thus, there could be not doubt which echo was 
    ESTONIA and consequently what her position was.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin replied 
      to Thörnroos:<br>
      <i>»No, I didn't get any position from them, but they must be here in the 
      neighbourhood, they have 20°-30° starboard list and blackout.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied.<br>
      <i>»I think that they are here at our port side approximately 45°.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Now more than 4 
    minutes had passed since the 1st Mayday of ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin said,<br>
      <i>»Okay, yes, I am just waking up the skipper.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At about this time 
    MARIELLA altered course towards ESTONIA.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Suddenly Andres Tammes 
    came back, now clearly with desperation in his voice: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Are you coming 
      to assistance?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously the Estonians 
    had now given up all hope, because the list must then have been some 70°, 
    only 2 minutes later the bridge was under water.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin asked:<br>
      <i>»Yes, can you see us?« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Tammes, however, 
    in his desperate situation, having to face the loss of his life within the 
    next minutes, apparently did not understand this as he replied:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, I can 
      hear you.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As ESTONIA had been 
    on a south-easterly heading for some time already her deep starboard side 
    was exposed to the wind and sea; SILJA EUROPA was at port side aft of abeam 
    whilst MARIELLA was at port side about abeam, thus both vessels could most 
    likely be seen by those on the bridge of ESTONIA. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Seppelin then said: 
      <br>
      <i>»Okay, we will start to determine your position here now. Just a moment.« 
      </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After Thörnroos had 
    tried in vain to get in contact with Helsinki Radio via VHF or on 2182 kHz, 
    SILJA EUROPA asked:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Yes, have 
      you any visual contact at all with Estonia ?«</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »No.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Thörnroos replied 
    (which was wrong, because at that time the emergency illumination of ESTONIA 
    was still on.) Since he had seen the lights of ESTONIA clearly on the horizon 
    during the last minutes, this reply is not understandable. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thörnroos said 
      later: <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»This 
      was wrong and I shall, of course, be criticised for that.«</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Seppelin then 
      came back to Thörnroos, expressing himself rather softly by saying:<br>
      <i>»We must start and try to find her somewhere, it is a bit difficult to 
      say as they didn't give any position.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> But now, after all 
    hope for ESTONIA had apparently been given up, the chief mate of ESTONIA managed 
    to lower himself down to the front console where the Shipmate was installed 
    and read their position; his voice has been identified on the tape of the 
    distress communication shouting the position to Andres Tammes, who repeated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»59°22' (W), 
      21°40' (E)«.</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is unknown whether 
    this was really the correct Mayday position, because on the bridge of MARIELLA 
    the 2nd officer Ingmar Eklund noted the position having been 59°22' N, 21°39' 
    E, about 0.5 nm more to the West. Receipt of the position was confirmed by 
    SILJA EUROPA and then ESTONIA came back for the last time at 01.29.55 hours 
    - 7 minutes and 15 seconds after the first Mayday call and 5 minutes before 
    the battery-powered clock on the starboard side of the bridge stopped :</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Really bad, 
      it looks really bad here now.« </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andres Tammes said 
      and Seppelin replied:<br>
      <i>»Yes, it looks really bad«</i>, in a sort of routine way always repeating 
      what the other vessel said. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»We are on our 
      way and it is 21.40.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Tammes came back 
    once more at 01.30.06 hours, apparently in Estonian with a phrase which according 
    to the master of MARE BALTICUM, Erik Moik, meant:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»How far away

    that time the ferry must have been more or less on the side. According to 
    Henrik Sillaste - who was then already in the liferaft together with Silver 
    Linde and others - that was approximately the situation when Andres Tammes 
    and Tormi Ainsalu left the bridge through the port door and climbed down to 
    the 7th deck where they helped with the opening of liferafts and pushing them 
    into the water. Whereas the body of Andres Tammes was subsequently found, 
    Tormi Ainsalu is missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The behaviour of 
    those on the bridges of SILJA EUROPA and MARIELLA can simply be explained 
    by their reluctance to accept whatever the Estonians did or did not do. When 
    the first rather weak and hesitantly spoken Mayday was heard already at about 
    00.45 hours, the first thought of the officers on the bridges of the MARIELLA, 
    SILJA SYMPHONY and SILJA EUROPA was probably something to the effect of "Oh 
    no, not ESTONIA again, don't they even know what Mayday means?" and, indeed, 
    the first message was not repeated. When the 2nd officer Ainsalu called 'Mayday' 
    again rather weakly and hesitantly and even added "please" at 01.22 hours 
    the reaction on the bridges of the Finnish and Swedish ferries was not much 
    different (in the meantime the officers on SILJA EUROPA had changed watch 
    at 01.00 hours). They simply could not believe that the situation on the ESTONIA 
    was so bad as to justify a Mayday call, an impression which at the beginning 
    may even have been underlined by Andres Tammes's statement: <i>»We have a 
    bad list ..... I believe that it is 20°, 30°.... we have blackout.« </i>Only 
    later, when his voice had become really desperate and the lights of ESTONIA 
    had disappeared, did they realise that the situation was indeed very serious 
    and then they reacted appropriately.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A similar way 
    of thinking may probably have influenced the speed at which the rescue operation 
    was set into motion by those responsible, as will be explained in Chapter 
    22.3. </font></p>
