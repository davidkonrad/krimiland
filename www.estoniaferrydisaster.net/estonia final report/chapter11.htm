<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was equipped 
    with standard lashing belts for securing heavy vehicles and containers. Chocks 
    were available on board for additional securing of heavy vehicles and for 
    securing passenger cars on the hoistable car decks and on sloping deck surfaces. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The equipment 
    was stored in the service areas at the forward and aft ends of the car deck.

  Operating Practice and Instructions </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The chief officer 
    had the responsibility for cargo handling and planning loading operations. 
    Both second officers were engaged in the actual loading and unloading on the 
    car deck and all lashing of cargo was performed under their supervision.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Besides the 
    second officers, the boatswain was directly engaged in lashing operations 
    together with the deck hands.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">No standard cargo 
    loading plan was followed on board - but there was a general scheme - and 
    a sketch of the cargo allocation was made before loading started. According 
    to the JAIC the overall guidance for the lashing of the cargo, given in IMO 
    Resolution A 581 (14)<i> "Guidelines for Securing Arrange-ments for the Transport 
    of Road Vehicles on Ro-Ro Ships"</i> and in IMO Resolution A 714 (17), was 
    applied. The vessel also carried a cargo securing manual, issued by Estline, 
    which however, was not available during the inspection by the two Swedish 
    Sjöfartsverket inspectors and their trainees some hours before the last departure 
    - see Chapter 15. According to frequent travellers personal cars and vans 
    were never secured, trucks and trailers sometimes and trailers without trucks 
    mostly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the voyage 
    the cargo was checked by the seaman of the watch on his watch-round who had 
    to activate control clocks at particular check points. On the car deck there 
    were said to be one in the forward, one in the middle and one in the aft part. 
    The car deck could also be checked on monitors on the bridge and in the engine 
    control room by means of 4 cameras located forward, aft and at both sides 
    of the centre casing. </font></p>
