  <i>Investigation Report on Possible Explosion Damage on the Ferry "Estonia"</i><br>
  by Brian H.L. Braidwood, MBIM, MIExpE, Weymouth/UK</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">At the beginning 
    of this subchapter the Estonian managing director of Estline,</font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
    Johannes Juhanson, shall be quoted when he told the Estonian media on 29.09.94:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»"Estonia" 
      was sunk by an abnormal factor, an explosion or an underwater collision.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In February 1999 
    Brian Braidwood was requested by this 'Group of Experts' to look into certain 
    aspects of the casualty in his capacity as diving and underwater explosives 
    expert, in particular to investigate whether explosive devices were present 
    on board the ESTONIA and had caused damage when they exploded before the sinking 
    of the ferry.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After a very 
    careful investigation Brian Braidwood concentrated his attention on three 
    aspects, viz.:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a. The suspect 
      package found during underwater surveys by the port side of the bow ramp.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">b. Damage 
      near the visor starboard side locks. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">c. Damage 
      on the car deck at the port side forward.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After dealing with 
    each item in turn, he has drawn certain conclusions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These are:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> a.<b> The suspect 
    package</b><br>
    It has been considered whether this suspect package could have been an explosive 
    device even if the sides of the cube were no longer than 100 mm - the smallest 
    estimate. A block of this size would indeed have enough space to hold all 
    the essential components of a small explosive charge of one to two kilograms.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finding such 
    a device near the side locks suggests an attempt to damage the ship at a particularly 
    vulnerable position. However, in later video surveys of the same area, the 
    package has disappeared. When or how the device got there must remain a matter 
    of conjecture. It can only be emphasised that the act of placing and arming 
    such a charge takes only a few seconds as the firing time will have been set 
    beforehand. A determined saboteur might well decide to increase his possibility 
    of success by placing more charges, at similar vulnerable points elsewhere 
    on the ship. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood 
    concludes that on a balance of probabilities the suspect package could have 
    been an explosive device containing between one and three kilograms of plastic 
    explosive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>b. Damage near 
    the visor starboard side locks</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Photos of the 
    visor tank on land, show that on the starboard side, the two metal plates 
    forming the hook for the manual side lock were severely distorted and folded 
    onto an overlapping position. The lug for the hydraulic side lock has been 
    ripped off the visor tearing away a flap of metal. The photos also show distinct 
    darkening of the white paint surface above the badly distorted hook for the 
    manual side lock. This marking looks like burn or scorch marks.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the port 
    side, however, the ends of the two metal plates forming the hook for the manual 
    side lock had only been pressed together. Also, the lug of the hydraulic side 
    lock had been ripped off where its welding has given way, but there was no 
    sign of burn marks anywhere on the port side. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are several 
    black and white photos and one composite picture made up of overlapping video 
    stills. This composite picture gives a dramatically clear impression of the 
    damage to the ship's bulkhead in the area of the side locks. This view of 
    the damaged area was taken from the forward side of the bulkhead looking aft. 
    The bottom half of the picture shows the opening for the manual side-lock 
    hooks. Above that is the hydraulic side-lock lug which was torn off the visor. 
    Above that again is a fresh hole in the metal. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Dealing with 
    the details from the bottom, the picture shows that the extreme lower end 
    of the manual side-lock opening is still in the shape of a smooth curve and 
    so is undamaged. However, within a very short distance, the metal has been 
    splayed out towards the camera. This is easier to see in the actual video.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At the top 
    of the opening for the manual side lock, photos show damage to the bulkhead 
    in the immediate vicinity of the visor damage just described. In a colour 
    photo, the opening designed to receive the hook of the manual side lock, has 
    been enlarged by damage at its upper end and some pieces of metal may have 
    been completely displaced from the area. The manual side-lock securing mechanism 
    can been still inside the hole as it was never secured for the final voyage. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hydraulic 
    side-lock lug, which was ripped away from the visor, was lodged in its recess 
    on the starboard front bulkhead where it would normally be located when locked. 
    At the edges of the hole the metal seems to have split in all directions away 
    from the centre. this is all characteristic of the sea of an explosion.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Just above 
    this area there is a fresh hole which is made by a flap having been pushed 
    back in an S-shaped fold. It is a fairly round hole about 250 mm across. Some 
    of the metal has been pushed in, (away from the camera position). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A comparison with 
    the port side bulkhead showed no damage at all that might have been compatible 
    with an explosion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The circumstances 
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, 
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor 
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well 
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through 
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the 
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the 
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from 
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this 
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The marking 
    and damage suggests that if an explosive device was used it would have been 
    placed on the after side of the bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock 
    slot. This means that a device like the one described earlier would have remained 
    in place despite water flowing through the slot just below it. When it exploded, 
    it was probably completely surrounded by water, with the other side of the 
    bulkhead also flooded. This would have resulted in a strong shock wave through 
    the water reaching the nearby visor. However, the presence of water on both 
    sides of the bulkhead would have reduced the area of damage. The chock might 
    well have fractured the welds of the hydraulic side-lock lug, which was retained 
    in the bulkhead by its pin. The welds apparently tore out the triangular strip 
    of metal seen on the photo of the visor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To sum it up, the 
    following damage has been described and illustrated in the area of the starboard 
    side lock: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and torn 
      metal damaged around the top part of the manual side-lock opening front 
      bulkhead. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of 
      this damaged metal has been pushed forward towards the visor.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Darkening 
      of the visor paintwork at exactly the same level as the damaged metal described.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The hydraulic 
      side-lock hooks just below the burn marks were pushed down and severely 
      distorted in a manner unlikely to have resulted from any mechanical impact.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On a balance of 
    probabilities Brian Braidwood has concluded that: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The damage near 
      the starboard visor side locks was caused by an explosion.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge 
      weight was between one and two kilograms of TNT equivalent.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explosive 
      device was placed on the forward bulkhead, just above the manual side-lock 
      recess.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the 
      crewman responsible for operating the manual side lock.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>c. Damage to 
    the car deck port side forward<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Brian Braidwood 
    investigates damage in the port forward corner of the car deck, to establish 
    if it might have been caused by an explosion. The damage can been seen in 
    a short part of Video B40c which was taken by a diver. From the video it seems 
    that the diver may not even have been aware of this particular damage, or 
    else was told to look away and concentrate on other areas. The damage is only 
    visible when the camera and light, which the diver is wearing on his head, 
    are turned briefly to one side. There is no reference to the hole by either 
    the diver or his supervisor. Nevertheless, the relevant section of the video 
    has been studied in great detail to establish the possible cause of damage. 
    The image is seen most clearly when the video is played in very slow motion, 
    or even frame by frame, using specialist viewing equipment.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The videos 
    and still photos from around the port forward corner of the car deck show 
    a widespread presence of some sort of red or pink material. Some of it is 
    very shiny and reflects the diver's light. The material may be bedding. In 
    an case it seems to have been used to reduce the flow of water from the flooded 
    visor space past the edge of the raised bow ramp and into the car deck. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on estimates 
    from studying the video and still photos, the lower edge of the damage is 
    about 300 mm above the deck level and there is no apparent damage to the deck 
    itself. This suggest that the device may have been lying on something, perhaps 
    bedding, when it exploded. It could, therefore, have been placed in a higher 
    position and become dislodged by some physical impact in the immediate vicinity. 
    The forward edge of the damage is about 300 mm away from the forward edge 
    of the bulkhead.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Inside and 
    around the hole can be seen the red and pink colouring of the bedding. It 
    looks as if some of it was inside the adjacent compartment and can be seen 
    through the damage hole. The damage hole itself is fairly round and about 
    300 mm across.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The hole is 
    bordered by petals of split metal which have split in all directions away 
    from the centre of the hole. The photos are taken looking at the bulkhead 
    from inside the car deck space and it can be seen how the petals cast strong 
    shadows onto the bulkhead. This clearly shows that the metal has been pushed 
    away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The circumstances 
    surrounding a possible explosion can be explained as follows: By midnight, 
    the weather had deteriorated and because of an ineffective seal the visor 
    space was filling up with sea water. By 0045 the level would have been well 
    above the hydraulic side locks. This water would have been pouring through 
    the openings for the side locks to flood the compartments adjacent to the 
    car deck. It would also have been coming directly into the car deck past the 
    ineffective bow ramp seal. At about this time a major crash was heard from 
    the forward part of the car deck. There was certainly a lot of noise by this 
    time and this may have masked the sound of a small explosion. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the device 
    exploded in the manual side-lock access compartment the space would have been 
    flooded. This means the device would have been surrounded by water with air 
    on the car deck side of the damaged bulkhead. However, from the comparatively 
    small extent of damage, it is unlikely that any device exploded in contact 
    with the bulkhead, and there is no way of knowing how far from the bulkhead 
    it might have been.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary the following 
    circumstances were established:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - A fairly round 
      damage hole in the port bulkhead of the car deck adjacent to the bow ramp.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Split and 
      torn metal petals around the edge of the hole.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- All of 
      the damaged metal pushed away from the bulkhead into the car deck space.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- That any 
      explosive device used could have been dislodged from a higher position and 
      fallen on some bedding in the compartment next to the car deck.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Any device 
      used would have been surrounded by water when it exploded. These points, 
      taken together, suggest that a small explosion occurred on the far side 
      of the bulkhead with the seat of the explosion being in the centre of the 
      damage hole.<br>
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On a balance of probabilities, 
    Brian Braidwood has concluded that:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The damage in 
      the car deck port side forward was caused by an explosion.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The charge 
      weight was between one and two kilograms of TNT equivalent. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The explosive 
      device was placed inside the space used to give access to the visor side 
      locks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      could easily have been placed by someone following the route taken by the 
      crewman responsible for securing the manual side locks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The seat 
      of the explosion was just above deck level as if the device had been resting 
      on something, perhaps a pile of blankets, before it went off.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The device 
      may be have been placed on the forward bulkhead like the one on the starboard 
      side, and been knocked off to fall onto some bedding before it exploded.</font></p>

    on the balance of probabilities:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1. The condition

      bulkhead on tearing away from its base plate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2. The lack of 
      damage to the starboard actuator means that the adjacent hole in the forward

      its base plate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3. The hole in
