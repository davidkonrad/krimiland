    Further Evidence </font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This and the following pages 
    were left empty for possible new evidence and are thus used for additional 
    testimony received from survivors during the November 1999 hearings and which 
    shall be quoted as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Carl-Erik Reintamm - cabin 
    1094 - 1st deck: </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- He couldn't sleep well 
    and suddenly he heard a sound like the vessel was proceeding through ice, 
    it was "a scraping noise", after he had realised that it couldn't be ice during 
    that time of the year, he finally thought that the vessel ran over something, 
    ca. half a minute later the vessel heeled to starboard.<br>
    - he ran out into the alleyway, but he didn't look at his watch, in the alleyway 
    he saw water in the angle between the wall and the floor streaming along the 
    wall with considerable speed, <br>
    - it was a considerable quantity of water, about 40 centimetres high, which 
    was not running down the stairs from the above car deck, but was rushing very 
    quickly through the centre alleyway in the angle between wall and floor, which 
    made him run even faster into the stairway and up; <br>
    - he did not note any water coming through the car deck doors but heard an 
    alarm signal which sounded like an old fashioned alarm clock which was ringing 
    all the time without interruption, <br>
    - when he came up to Deck 7 he saw two officers from the crew wearing white 
    shirts with epaulettes, but he doesn't recall the number of stripes, at least 
    one of them had a walkie-talkie in his hand, <br>
    - he informed them that the vessel was taking water into deck 1, where upon 
    one officer instructed the other one to go down and check the situation when 
    quite suddenly the ship heeled over again; and the two officers fell to the 
    deck, where after both got back on their feet and went down, probably to investigate; 
    <br>
    - he went out on deck through the left door on Deck 7 (that was the door on 
    the part which was down) and saw two ferries far away from the "Estonia"; 
    <br>
    - the lamps went off and on and the vessel heeled more and more,<br>
    - probably when he tried o release a life boat, he saw a huge thing floating 
    along the vessel, but he cannot exactly say when he saw it, the thing looked 
    square and at first he thought that is was a part of the vessel the waves 
    were washing over it and it was then on one level with the sea surface, he 
    says it was so "quite some time" and others should have also seen it,<br>
    - in the official protocol he was wrongly quoted since it was stated there 
    that he had seen "many items", but he underlines that it was only one item, 
    several metres long each side, like a steel plate it was white and/or light 
    and it was big and still very close and that moment he thought that this item 
    was "the reason for everything", <br>
    - it floated away with small waves coming over it and then it disappeared.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Pierre Thiger - Admiral's 
    Pub - 5th deck, starboard aft :</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - when he was on the port 
    side of the hull and looked forward, he saw something looking like a stabiliser 
    fin, it was a least 5 metres long and standing completely in the air, but 
    it could not have been a stabiliser fin which was much further aft, the object 
    moved transverse and it was 50 % higher than wide <br>
    - he was sitting above the stabiliser fin, but the thing he saw was far forward 
    of the vessel<br>
    - he was subsequently washed into the water by a wave, and when he finally 
    had time to look from in the water, he saw that the visor was no more there. 
    <br>
    Note: The "thing" Pierre Thiger saw far forward must have been the port aft 
    part of the visor bulwark sticking up and extending the port hull side of 
    the ferry. See page 1091.</font></p>
