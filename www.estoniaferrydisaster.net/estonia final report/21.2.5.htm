  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In detail:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (1) <b>on 29.09.94</b> 
    by the Estonian security police in Turku:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - commenced his 
      first watch ever in the engine room of ESTONIA at 00.00 hours, made an inspection 
      round of the engine room and returned to the ECR, whereafter Margus Treu 
      made his round;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - sometime later 
      the bridge ordered to activate the stabilisers;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- at 00.46 
      hours he saw a jet of water penetrating the right side of the bow ramp,</b> 
      and thought it was rain water, did not report it to anybody; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- when Margus Treu 
      returned to the ECR Kadak went to the workshop next to the ECR and on same 
      deck, and did some work;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - suddenly the 
      vessel sank down and fell to starboard, he ran back to the ECR, where Treu 
      was watching the monitor and said:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>"The situation 
        is serious" or "bad" "because the ramp has been struck and became broken.";</b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw on the monitor 
      that there were high waves on the car deck and the water level had already 
      reached the height of the personal cars;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - thereafter the 
      light began to blink which meant "boat alarm";</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - then <b>Henrik 
      Sillaste came in </b>and the <b>watertight doors closed again;</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    means that the watertight doors were already closed when Henrik Sillaste arrived 
    1-2 minutes after the sharp heel to starboard. Since a sharp heel to starboard 
    is no reason to close the watertight door in the engine room, there must have 
    been something else and earlier which caused Margus Treu to close the watertight 
    doors, apparently without instructions from the bridge, because he has testified 
    that he had only had two communications with the bridge subsequently in relation 
    to pumping water to the high port side. </font></p>

    the JAIC members in Turku:<br>
    This statement is not available.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (3) <b>on 31.03.95</b> 
    by the JAIC members in Gothenburg: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Main subject of the 
    questioning of Hannes Kadak was his statement - obviously uninfluenced - made 
    on 29.09.94 (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.5.284.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    20.2.5.284</a>) in Turku <b>that at 00.46 hours he had seen water penetrating 
    on the right side of the bow ramp. <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On pages 
    162 ff. of the book "<i>Katastrofen Kurs</i>" by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, 
    who had early access to the confidential protocol of the meeting, the Questions/Answers 
    quoted below developed: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»JAIC: Are these 
      statements correct?</i></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have 
      thought a lot about it in hindsight, but I cannot say if it was exactly 
      that way.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: You say 
      here that you saw water before midnight (Swedish time)?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: I have 
      thought it over and it can be totally wrong.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> JAIC: We may 
      consequently consider it to be uncertain?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Kadak: Uncertain. 
      </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: Uncertain. 
      This can mean that it might have been so or it might not have been so. In 
      the statement it is written down that ".. at 23.46 hours I saw on the monitor 
      that water penetrated at the right side of the ramp". Is it correct that 
      you said so to the officer in charge of the interrogation? </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: It is 
      so that, after coming home, I have thought it over and it is so that I am 
      not so sure about it, and I have considered whether it could be wrong and 
      why could I say so. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">JAIC: But you 
      did say so to the interpreter during the questioning on the 29th?</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Kadak: After 
      I came ashore I have testified so many times.«</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At this stage 
      Enn Neidre, member of the Estonian part of JAIC and in a captain's full 
      dress uniform, interrupted the discussion:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Neidre: I 
      made notes at the hearing on 29 September and in these notes nowhere can 
      the time 23.46 hours be found.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It 
    is clear that Neidre never wrote down 23.46 hours as Kadak never said 23.46, 
    because he was talking in Estonian time and in his respective statement 00.46 
    hours is stated as the time when he saw the water penetrating.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The psychological 
    expert to the JAIC, Bengt Schager, commented on the Kadak testimony as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»... that Kadak 
      probably saw a water stream, but that he is afraid that this information 
      can be relevant. We have no evidence that he has more information than he 
      has told us and today he might be unwilling to give more information, because 
      he might correctly assume that in such a case he would be partly blamed 
      for the catastrophe ...., the water stream could hardly have been there, 
      rather small or thin, because then it would hardly be visible on a small 
      monitor.« </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The further statement 
    of Hannes Kadak, viz. that Margus Treu had told him:<b><i> "The situation 
    is dangerous or bad, because the ramp was struck and became broken."</i></b> 
    is much more important, but was apparently not questioned by the JAIC.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary 
    it has to be concluded that the JAIC changed the initial statement of Kadak, 
    that he saw - expressed carefully and already under intimidation - <b>a jet 
    of water penetrating the bow ramp,</b> into a "trickle" of water. Of course, 
    a "trickle" would certainly have been difficult to observe on the small monitor, 
    so what Kadak must have seen was much more, viz. almost the same picture that 
    all three of them saw subsequently and of which Sillaste made two drawings. 
    The reason why Kadak did not react differently was most likely because he 
    was on his first watch ever on ESTONIA and simply did not know any better.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the statements 
    made by Treu and Sillaste in 1996 and subsequently - as is now known - that 
    all three - Treu, Kadak and Sillaste - had left the engine control room much 
    earlier, i.e. Kadak and Sillaste when the heel was 30°-35° and Treu when the 
    heel was 40°-45°. It also explains how 2nd engineer Peeter Tüür saw Kadak 
    on the open deck 7 as he left his cabin on the forward port side of deck 7 
    through the window. Since Sillaste and Kadak were together with Silver Linde 
    in the same liferaft, which they all boarded in the forward part below the 
    bridge and Linde has testified that he was in the liferaft already a<b>t 01.23 
    hours</b>, it has to be assumed that they were out on the open deck 7 at a 
    rather early stage, earlier than many crew members from cabins on decks 7 
    and 8, not to speak of the passengers from the lower decks! </font></p>
