  control</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The propulsion system consisted 
  of four medium-speed diesel engines, connected in pairs to two propeller shafts 
  via gear boxes. The engines were four-stroke turbo-charged engines with eight 
  cylinders and a maximum continuous output of 4 400 kW each. They were designed 
  to operate on heavy fuel oil. Maximum continuous operating revolutions of the 
  engines were 600 rpm which corresponded to 188 rpm of the propellers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Each propeller shaft carried 
  one controllable-pitch propeller with a diameter of 4.0 m. The port-side propeller 
  rotated clockwise and the starboard side one counter-clockwise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The pitch control of the propellers 
  was hydraulic, separate for each propeller. The control was effected electrically 
  be power selector levers on the main control console on the bridge, on the bridge 
  wings and in the engine control room. The control signal from the power selector 
  affected the engine revolutions as well as the propeller pitch via an electro-hydraulic 
  "combinator". Revolutions and pitch both increased at increasing power settings 
  up to about 70% output, when the maximum continuous engine revolutions, i.e. 
  800 rpm were reached. After that, the output could be further increased to 90% 
  by increasing the propeller pitch only while the revolutions of the engines 
  remained at 600 rpm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">All the normal indicators, alarms 
  and control devices were on the bridge and in the engine control room. The installation 
  qualified for unmanned machinery space at sea in accordance with the classification 
  requirements, but actual operation was at all times conducted with the engine 
  control room manned by one engineer and one motorman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The total fuel oil tank capacity 
  was 940 m³ of heavy fuel oil and 291 m³ of marine diesel oil. Bunkering for 
  a complete round trip was always done in Stockholm. </font></p>
