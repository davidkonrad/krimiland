  Working Routines and Organisation </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As this 'Group of 
    Experts' to a large extent agrees with the findings of the JAIC regarding 
    the Working Routines and Organisation their findings are repeated here:</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><font size="3"><b>7.2.1<br>
    Deck department</b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The master 
    was responsible for all activities on board the vessel. He reported to ESCO 
    on all matters regarding navigation, day-to-day operation, personnel and related 
    issues. In technical matters, he reported to Nordström & Thulin.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The master in command 
    on the accident night was the Number 1 master of the ESTONIA, Arvo Andresson, 
    "and it was he who, together with his superiors at the office, laid down rules 
    and routines for work on board". </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b>This 
      is the view of the JAIC, whilst actually they just copied everything from 
      the predecessor vessel NORD ESTONIA which is proven, inter alia, by the 
      fact that the radio officer did not exist on the safety plan of the ESTONIA, 
      because on the NORD ESTONIA there was no radio officer. Also the advisers 
      were not shown on the safety plan because on NORD ESTONIA there were no 
      advisers. (See also Subchapters 5.3 and 7.1.3.) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to standing 
    orders laid down by him, the various responsibilities and duties, in addition 
    to normal watch duties, were divided between the deck officers as described 
    below.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The chief officer 
    had the responsibility for cargo operations and the planning of these. He 
    was also responsible for the daily work of the deck crew. The second officer 
    A was responsible for the navigation equipment, and also assisted the chief 
    officer with cargo operations. He led the port lifeboat group and was responsible 
    for associated lifesaving equipment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The second officer 
    B was responsible for stability calculations prior to departure, and assisted 
    the chief officer with the cargo operations. He also led the starboard lifeboat 
    group and was responsible for associated lifesaving equipment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The third officer 
    was in charge of nautical charts and literature, and was also responsible 
    for the calibration of all clocks on board. The fourth officer was responsible 
    for keeping the log of the working hours of the deck crew, and for keeping 
    lists of certificates of competence and passports for the deck crew. He was 
    also responsible for cargo declarations to the harbour authorities, and for 
    the documentation of cargo operations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The radio officer 
    was responsible for the radio, including the emergency beacons (EPIRBs) and 
    communication equipment, and in co-operation with the second officer A for 
    the maintenance of the electronic navigation equipment. He was also responsible 
    for making and updating crew lists. The ESTONIA was certified for pre-GMDSS 
    operation and consequently the radio officer had to keep watch on 500 kHz 
    and 2182 kHz. The watch hours at sea were from 19.00 to 01.00 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the vessel was 
    at sea, there were always two officers and one AB seaman on duty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On westbound voyages, 
    the second officer B was on duty between 20.00 and 01.00 hours assisted by 
    the third officer, and the second officer A was on duty between 01.00 and 
    06.00 hours, assisted by the fourth officer. For the periods between departure 
    and 20.00 and between 06.00 hours and arrival, the bridge watch was taken 
    by the master and the chief officer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> During the sea voyage, 
    the AB seamen changed watches at 22.00, 02.00 and 06.00 hours. Their duties 
    at sea were to be additional lookouts and to make watch rounds on a defined 
    route throughout the vessel (Supplement). These rounds were made once every 
    hour, starting at 20.30 hours and lasted for about 25 minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Watch rounds were 
    also made by the security guards. They had no other duties than to ascertain 
    the safety and security of the vessel and the passengers, and they patrolled 
    continuously.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b><font size="3">7.2.2<br>
    Engine department</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The chief engineer 
    was responsible for the organisation and all work in the engine department, 
    for the purchase and storage of spare parts and consumables, and for the technical 
    maintenance of the entire vessel. He reported to the technical superintendent 
    of Nordström & Thulin, Ulf Hobro and certain parts of these reports were copied 
    to ESCO. His day-to-day contact within the N&T organisation was Tomas Rasmusson, 
    the assistant to Ulf Hobro. The second engineer was in charge of the separators, 
    the steering gear and all other hydraulic and pneumatic systems, including 
    the systems for manoeuvring and locking the visor, the ramps and the hull 
    doors as well as the stabilisers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The systems engineer 
    was in charge of the fresh water distribution systems, the sewage system and 
    the galley equipment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The work schedule 
    in the engine department was a traditional three-watch system. On each watch 
    there were one engineer and one motorman. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The watches 12.00-16.00 
    hrs and 24.00-04.00 hrs were held by the third engineer, the watches 04.00-08.00 
    hrs and 16.00-20.00 hrs by the second engineer and the watches 08.00-12.00 
    hrs and 20.00-24.00 hrs by the fourth engineer.</font></p>

    Catering department</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The total number 
    of persons employed in the catering department was 121. The catering department 
    was managed by the chief purser, who was responsible for the organisation 
    and conduct of the work. He was also responsible for the commercial results 
    of the department. Regarding personnel, maintenance and other operational 
    matters he reported to ESCO via the master. His economic reporting was to 
    Estline in Stockholm. There was a Swedish or Finnish adviser for the Estonian 
    chief purser, who from the time of the take-over until July 1994 was Marlene 
    Andersson, the wife of the nautical adviser until July 1993, Captain Anders 
    Andersson. On the last voyage it was the Finn Jan Bergendahl from Mariehamn 
    who did not survive. </font></p>
