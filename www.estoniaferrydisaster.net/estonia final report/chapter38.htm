  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The JAIC continued their 
    endeavours to confirm their hypothetical casualty scenario and to improve 
    the argumentation and evidence in favour of it. It was planned to publish 
    a detailed technical Part-Report as soon as possible. Regular press statements 
    in line with the above strengthened the public opinion in the Nordic countries 
    that the main blame for the catastrophe rested with the builders, Meyer Werft 
    in Papenburg. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused the Managing Director of the yard, 
    Bernard Meyer, to instruct his lawyer, Dr. Peter Holtappels, to form an own 
    team of experts to investigate the real causes for the sinking of the ESTONIA.

  <p align="center"><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">38.1<br>
    The German 'Group of Experts'</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Dr. Peter Holtappels, senior 
    lawyer with the law firm Ahlers & Vogel, Hamburg, became the chairman of the 
    new team and engaged Prof. Dr. Eike Lehmann from the Technical University, 
    Hamburg, to perform the investigation from the Naval Architect's point of 
    view and Captain Werner Hummel, Marine Consultant and Managing Director of 
    Marine Claims Partner (Germany) GmbH, Hamburg was engaged to investigate the 
    visor condition, the ESTONIA berths in Tallinn and Stockholm and collect all 
    information relevant to the casualty. In addition, Captain Håkan Karlsson 
    from Mariehamn/Åland Islands was engaged in his capacity as one of two masters 
    having been in charge of the ESTONIA for about 12 years. Simultaneously Meyer 
    Werft nominated a member of its Design and Construction Department, Naval 
    Architect Dipl. Ing. Tomas Wilkendorf as co-ordinator of the internal yard 
    investigation and link to the 'Group of Experts'. Already the first of three 
    inspections of the visor in Hangö revealed: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that the visor, although well painted from the outside, 
    was in an extremely bad maintenance condition; - that the starboard visor 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinge had been in a very poor condition already before the 
    casualty with deep burning marks and fatigue crack propagations in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way 
    of the broken parts of the visor arm and elsewhere; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that numerous water marks inside the visor indicated that 
    the visor had been water-filled at sea up to different levels obviously &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depending 
    on the outside water height, i.e. that the visor had not been weather tight;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that the (lowest) 3rd stringer was covered with oil on 
    which fresh footprints were visible indicating substantial activity inside 
    the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visor after the water had left the visor the last time 
    before it was lifted ashore in Hangö, i.e. before the last arrival at respectively 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the last departure from Tallinn. <br>
    The areas in the aft bulkheads of the visor, where the lugs of the hydraulic 
    side locks had been located, were already burnt out and taken to Stockholm. 
    The starboard hooks of the manual side locks were crushed while the port ones 
    were intact and just bent slightly together. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big lug fitted to the after part of the 
    heavily damaged visor bottom was in place but almost cracked off the visor. 
    This lug was part of the Atlantic lock. For further details see <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    30</a>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In brief, it was very obvious that this was not a 
    normal and properly maintained visor, but a misaligned, leaking structure 
    with poorly treated and thus considerably weakened hinges and manual locks, 
    which apparently had not been engaged. The numerous footprints on the 3rd 
    and to some extent on the 2nd stringer indicated quite some activities inside 
    the closed visor which is unusual because the only installation inside the 
    visor, the Atlantic lock, was normally operated remote controlled from the 
    car deck. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later at a fortuitous meeting with 
    Uno Laur in his Tallinn office, he explained the following: <br>
    - the visor was leaking and at sea full to the outside water level; <br>
    - the hydraulic installation of the Atlantic lock was leaking as "did all 
    hydraulic installations on older vessels", thus hydraulic oil was swimming 
    on top of the water surface inside the visor when the vessel was at sea;<br>
    - the hydraulic oil caused the water marks inside the visor and, when the 
    speed was lowered, the water left the visor through the gaps in the bottom 
    and the oil settled down on the stringers, frames and on the bottom - see 
    also Subchapters <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">12.4.4.</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.;</a><br>
    - as the Atlantic lock had suffered badly during the last ice winter (January 
    to March 1994) when the crew had to hack to pieces the ice inside the frozen 
    visor, it could no more be opened and closed by the hydraulic cylinder, but 
    this had to be done manually by hammering; <br>
    - therefore each time before arrival at Tallinn two crew members went down 
    and hammered the bolt open and after Tallinn they hammered the bolt closed 
    - see <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a>. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: At that time it was unknown to this 'Group of Experts' that the 
    sensors had been dismounted because they were also damaged by the ice hacking 
    and as long as crew members were going down to hammer open or closed the bolt 
    of the Atlantic lock it was not required to renew the sensors, which were 
    anyway hindering the hammering. This was at least the opinion of N&T as technical 
    managers of the ferry. Had it been known, Uno Laur would certainly have been 
    asked as well and he would probably have told the real background. Now it 
    took some months longer before a Finnish engineer with a friend among the 
    2nd crew of the ESTONIA relayed the information that the sensors had been 
    dismantled because they were damaged and were causing short circuits in the 
    electrical system of the car deck and as each time when the Atlantic lock 
    had to be opened or closed the crew members went down to do the job, the sensors 
    were not needed. Before this background it is of course understandable that 
    Stenström threw the already recovered bolt of the Atlantic lock back into 
    the sea, because it clearly showed the hammering marks and also two different 
    contact marks indicating that the bolt had sometimes been fully closed and 
    sometimes only partly closed which has nevertheless been clearly established 
    from the available video footage. It is also understandable that Stenström 
    ordered the divers to burn off the sensor plate and to clip off the cut ends 
    of the sensor cables and subsequently throw both to the bottom of the sea 
    consisting of soft clay where they disappeared forever (see Subchapters <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5</a>, 
    <a href="chapter27.htm" target="_blank">27.1</a> and <a href="29.2.htm" target="_blank">29.2</a>).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> In any event, it was now 
    quite clear that the publications and statements by the JAIC were, if at all, 
    only part of the truth and that the crew and possibly also owners/technical 
    managers of the ferry had had difficulties with exactly these locking devices 
    which - according to the JAIC - had triggered off the casualty sequence-of-events 
    by their failure. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new information was evaluated and discussed 
    and by fax of 20 January Dr. Holtappels suggested a meeting with the JAIC 
    to which Börje Stenström replied on 20 January among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Appreciate the opportunity 
      to get views from a group of experts from your side, the commission is certainly 
      open for any constructive comments on the development of the accident. For 
      your information the full commission will have a meeting in Helsinki on 
      26-27 January. We do not expect to have any press conference but questions 
      from media are unavoidable. The official view of SHK was published in a 
      news release via the Swedish press news agency a week ago, stating that 
      the report of the commission was delayed because more time had been allowed 
      to the yard to complete their investigations, metallurgical investigations 
      were still going on in Stockholm and the commission had initiated a second 
      look at the weather conditions and in particular any specific wave conditions 
      at the site of the accident." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On 26 and 27 January 1994 
    the JAIC met in Helsinki and from the protocol the following items are quoted: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"4 Bow Visor <br>
      Börje Stenström presented a status report on the technical findings and 
      technical evaluation of the probable sequence of events and cause of the 
      accident. Several supporting investigations are still going on. Comments 
      from the shipyard have not yet been received. The members and experts are 
      working on the report concerning the bow visor. When the draft report is 
      ready it will be sent to the commission members and experts. Tuomo Karppinen 
      presented SSBA model experiments. Simulations will be continued. <br>
      5 The Estonian delegation presented material on the adequacy and qualifications 
      of the crew of M/V "Estonia". <br>
      6 All the lifeboats and liferafts of M/V "Estonia" which have been found 
      after the accident in Finland and Estonia have been photographed and examined 
      by the technical group for the Finnish Central Criminal Police with the 
      assistance of an expert from the Finnish Maritime Administration. A copy 
      of the report (including a selection of pictures) of one liferaft examination 
      was presented." </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> At a subsequent press conference 
    the present status was presented to the international media. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 30 January the first meeting of the German 
    'Group of Experts' was held during which the forthcoming meeting with the 
    JAIC scheduled for 16/17 February in Stockholm was prepared. A model of the 
    foreship with moveable visor and bow ramp of VIKING SALLY built by the yard 
    was presented. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">February 1994</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> On 2 February Börje Stenström 
    sent his revised "Assumed Sequence of Events" with illustrating drawings - 
    see Enclosure 38.1.462 - which repeated his earlier expressed thoughts.<br>
    By fax of 7 February Stenström requested the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"1. The bottom lock. 
      You indicated that the assembly consisting of the locking plunger housing 
      and the lugs should have been a shop assembly, properly welded. As far as 
      I recall one of the engineers attending our last meeting at Papenburg (presumably 
      a shop engineer) confirmed the weld was a normal installation weld. We have 
      no detailed drawing of the bottom lock assembly except as shown in drawing 
      number 49111-373. In case there is a shipyard drawing showing such an pre-fabricated 
      assembly, including welding details, we would much appreciate a copy. <br>
      2. The side locks. We have no dimensional drawing of the side lock lugs 
      except that shown in drawings 49111-372. If there is a more detailed drawing 
      we would like a copy. We would also like, if available, a copy of the design 
      calculations for the attachment to the visor and the associated weld joint.<br>
      3. Damage to rubber seals. As far as we understand, the heavy stem post 
      on front of the visor rests against the fixed continuation on the stem/bulbous 
      vow. This determines the vertical position of the visor in closed position 
      and any change of the steel work at the rubber seals would not change the 
      vertical position of the visor. In checking with inspectors who had been 
      onboard shortly before the accident there had been no signs of changes to 
      the rubber seal installation." </i></font></p>

      'Group of Experts' submitted what should be discussed at the meeting:</font></p>

      According to information from Tallinn the bolt of the lock could not be 
      opened/closed hydraulically since some time before the casualty. This was 
      given to us as explanation for the oil spill inside the visor and the many 
      footsteps on the 2nd and 3rd stringers. We were also told that ever since 
      then the bolt was closed and opened manually.<br>
      We have spoken with a number of ex crew members about this, but everybody 
      feels it difficult to believe that the bolt can be handled manually the 
      proper way. We would like to discuss this with you and, if possible, read 
      the relevant statements, e.g. from the witness who had reportedly seen the 
      green lamps on at a time when the visor - at least - was making upward and 
      downward movements. <br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">2. They are expecting a<b> 
    solely technical discussion </b>and from the German side the answers to the 
    questions raised by them already in November. <br>
    3. <b>Video material</b>: At first the Finns had sent down a ROV to the wreck 
    which took better pictures than the divers did. The video sent to the yard 
    does not contain ROV pictures which will, however, be made available, if requested. 
    The film sent to the yard had been made by an English diving team having examined 
    the wreck for 80-90 hours from a Norwegian semi-submersible (belonging to 
    the Norwegian Smit-Tak subsidiary) by order of the Swedish Maritime Administration. 
    The aim was to obtain material for a feasibility study in respect of the lifting 
    possibilities. Subsequently the divers were available to the JAIC for another 
    ca. 10 hours for examination of the foreship. Thereby Stenström has personally 
    directed the divers via a monitor and had a close eye on them all the time. 
    He excludes that the divers have dismounted the sensors of the Atlantic lock 
    (therefore it is established that this must have occurred before the casualty). 
    <br>
    4.<b> Recovered objects</b>: The divers have dismounted respectively burnt 
    off the well known parts including the bolt of the Atlantic lock. When they 
    were preparing the helicopter flight back some parts had to be left behind 
    due to weight restrictions. As the bolt did not show any changes except for 
    some notchings, it was left behind on the diving support vessel. He assumes 
    that the bolt has been thrown overboard in the meantime (weight ca. 25 kg). 
    The other parts will be shown to us tomorrow. We will receive name and contact 
    of the owners of the diving support vessel and shall find out where the bolt 
    actually is. <br>
    5. <b>Surviving crew members:</b> in total about 30, of whom only 4 were on 
    watch, i.e. 1 engineer, 2 motormen, 1 decksman (name: Silver Linde). He was 
    sent twice from the bridge to the car deck to check whether the ramp was still 
    tight. The last time was shortly before the catastrophe, the green lights 
    were always on. <br>
    6. <b>Atlantic lock</b>: As it had been assumed already they had not spent 
    much thought on it. The lugs are obviously broken an that is sufficient for 
    them, they thought. They have not yet realised that:<br>
    - the sensors were obviously dismounted before the casualty;<br>
    - the actuator as well as the bolt were turned about 90° towards aft; <br>
    - the port hydraulic hose was torn off. <br>
    They have no explanation for the oil spill on the lowest stringer of the visor 
    nor for the many footprints (also the technicians from N&T do not). On the 
    other hand, it is not in doubt that the heavy weather securings were not engaged.<br>
    7. <b>2 Swedish inspectors </b>have indeed inspected the vessel on the departure 
    day together with 9 Estonian trainees, however, they cannot give relevant 
    information. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: This means that Stenström began the "cooperation" with this 'Group 
    of Experts' with two untrue statements, namely: <br>
    (a) he alleged to have left the bolt onboard, although actually he had personally 
    thrown it overboard; and<br>
    (b) he stated that the two inspectors had no relevant information, although 
    at that time he had known for more than 3 months that those inspectors had 
    found such grave deficiencies on the ferry that they had tried to stop her 
    from sailing - see <a href="chapter15.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a>

    The February Meeting</font></b></font> </p>

    Stockholm on 16/17 February and was attended by the persons mentioned on the 
    previous pages.<br>
    Stenström advised that it was not the aim of the JAIC to blame somebody for 
    the casualty, but to establish the facts, i.e. the causes, and to issue recommendations 
    for the future which should avoid a repetition. He emphasized that the Swedish 
    part of the JAIC - Statens Havarie Kommission - is completely independent 
    and comparable to the U.S. National Transportation Board, while the Finnish 
    part, headed by its permanent chairman Kari Lethola, was attached to the Ministry 
    of Justice and the Estonian part was formed exclusively for this investigation.<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The open questions concerning 
    the locking devices of the visor were discussed in detail and in every thinkable 
    direction, however, whenever maintenance matters were discussed uncertainty 
    came up especially on the Estonian side. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a respective question the Finnish and Swedish 
    JAIC members explained that interrogation of the Estonian crew members as 
    well as all questions concerning the vessel, the shipping company, the organisation 
    and operation were exclusively dealt with by the Estonian JAIC member, Uno 
    Laur, because the other two members were the Transport Minister and the Head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO who could not - or only restrictively 
    - participate in the daily work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are obvious: Only that information 
    was passed to the Swedish/Finnish JAIC which did not affect Estonian interests 
    or which was already public. It was thus not surprising that the same Uno 
    Laur who had explained to a member of this 'Group of Experts' only 4 weeks 
    earlier - in the presence of one of his Finnish clients - why the footprints 
    were in the oil on the stringer, now tried to convince the audience that the 
    Atlantic lock had been operated hydraulically up to the end. It became obvious 
    in the course of the two days that the JAIC had not even considered to investigate 
    the condition of the vessel before her last departure and was content with 
    their hypothetical cause consideration and casualty sequence-of-events which 
    - "so sorry" - did put the blame almost entirely on the builders. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the meeting, the personal talks with 
    the Finnish participants and, in particular, with Börje Stenström were very 
    open in response to the many questions concerning the circumstances of the 
    casualty, the route, weather, crew and all the many relevant details of which 
    this 'Group of Experts' knew practically nothing, but which were of crucial 
    importance for the investigation. The Estonian participants in the discussions 
    tried to do everything to avoid the creation of a bad impression of vessel 
    and crew. When for example the subject "ice damage to vessel and visor" was 
    raised because the visor had obviously at least two quite heavy old damages, 
    Uno Laur said: <i>"It was a very, very mild winter. What should have happened. 
    Moreover the vessel had ice class 1A.</i>" Actually the Gulf of Finland and 
    the Middle and Northern Baltic were covered by thick ice from the end of January 
    to the beginning of April 1994 - see Subchapter 12.4.2 - and the ferry had 
    frequently been used as an "ice breaker". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The hypothetical scenario 
    of the JAIC had, however, serious weaknesses and some of them became very 
    apparent at the meeting. These were mainly: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">(a) the condition of the 
      locking devices as found;<br>
      (b) the uncertainty whether the locking devices were still original; <br>
      (c) the apparent fact that the maintenance and damage history of visor, 
      bow ramp, its locking devices and hinges had not been examined at all before 
      arriving at and going public with their scenario and the conclusions therefrom; 
      <br>
      (d) the apparent fact that visor seals were missing/damaged and the visor 
      had been full of water to the outside level at sea with (then) unknown consequences. 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Being so sure about their 
    scenario the Finns for example agreed to the visor condition as explained 
    under (d) above, while Stenström and the Estonians smelled trouble and were 
    reluctant. In any event, Karppinen and Rahka fully agreed that the visor had 
    always been full of water at sea, however later with-drew from this admission 
    completely, when they realised what consequences water in the visor had in 
    combination with a damaged bow ramp: water on the car deck. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the JAIC meeting in March in Tallinn among 
    other things also the protocol of the statement of the nautical student Rain 
    Oolmets to the criminal police in Tallinn made already on 03.10.94, i.e. 6 
    months before, was handed over to the Swedes/Finns. The reason for the long 
    delay in presenting this important statement to the JAIC is obvious: It dealt 
    with up to 10-cm long cracks in the welding seams of the visor hinges observed 
    by the student only some weeks before the casualty when he was the member 
    of a working team. See <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 12.5</a> 
    and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.177.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 
    12.5.177 - .179</a>. It was agreed that the man should identify the cracks 
    at the hinge remains of the visor in Hangö and Enn Neidre took over the arrangements 
    (apparently no one told him that the hinge remains had been cut off from the 
    visor already in January and were now at the KTH in Stockholm). In any event 
    the Swedish chairman, Olof Forssberg, wrote to the Estonian chairman, Andi 
    Meister, on 20 March among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"We agreed in Tallinn 
      to question two witnesses about the observation of cracks ........ " </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Andi Meister replied on the 
    following day, 27 March, among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"Referring to the Protocol 
      of Interrogation which was discussed by the Commission on the last meeting 
      ... Rudissaar, whom Oolmets claims he told about the matter, knows nothing 
      about it or has only heard people talking about this matter. <b>There is 
      a Mr. Gunnar Kull, who should know more</b>. Captain E. Neidre, member of 
      the commission, shall arrange <b>the trip to Helsinki for Oolmets and Kull.</b> 
      He will be in Helsinki with Oolmets and Kull in the morning of Friday 24th, 
      and they will go to Hanko by car."</i></font></p>

    Investigation and Communication</font></b></p>
  <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In the course of the following 
    days tank conditions and cargo distribution - then known by the JAIC, but 
    later proven to be incomplete - the Finnish videos made by ROVs in the early 
    days, and some stability calculations and other documents were received. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a subsequent letter Börje Stenström wrote 
    to Dr. Holtappels, the chairman of this 'Group of Experts' among other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I had the opportunity 
      to see part of your instructions to the team members and noted with appreciation 
      that they are instructed to work unbiased. I also feel that we were able 
      to do so during our meeting. I do disagree, however, with your little indication 
      that the international commission should not be unbiased. I would like you 
      to rest assured that the commission has only three goals, to establish what 
      hap-pened, why it happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. 
      I am speaking for the Swedish part of the commission in this matter since 
      we have a firm policy in this regard established by law. I take it that 
      our policy will also be valid for the entire commission as we do, in reality, 
      have the lead." </i><br>
      <b>Note:</b> The "little indication" that the JAIC might not be entirely 
      unbiased refers, of course, to the Estonian JAIC members Andi Meister and 
      Enn Neidre. The apparent fact that the Swedes had the "lead", although the 
      Estonians had been awarded the chairmanship, reflects the factual situation. 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The communication and exchange 
    of documentation and information with JAIC, in particular with Stenström, 
    went on and by fax of 28 March among other things the so-called "Explanatory 
    Note" was received - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.172.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.5.172</a> - which was apparently meant to be the Estonian answer to the 
    allegation of this 'Group of Experts' that the sensors of the Atlantic lock 
    had been dismounted some time before the casualty. The note, however, merely 
    states that the sensors on the ESTONIA were magnetic and not mechanical - 
    as stated on the drawings - and that during the time under Estonian flag the 
    sensors had not been changed, moreover that it was believed that these sensors 
    had been installed at newbuilding already because there were numerous others 
    of this type on other installations. In other words: the drawings of the yard 
    were wrong. This was not the case as was subsequently established when previous 
    Finnish electricians declared when and why they had changed the initial mechanical 
    sensors against the magnetic ones. See Subchapter 3.3.6, pages 42/43 of the 
    Final JAIC Report. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By fax of 29 March Stenström sent among other 
    things the Cargo Manifest by which he considered<i> "the truck loads to be 
    properly documented and the truck loads to look quite harmless"</i>. It is 
    revealed from the fax prints on top of the pages that it had been sent on 
    27 September 1994 at 18.38 hours from Estline-Tallinn and that Stenström had 
    received it on 29.11.94 from N&T. See also <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.211.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.211</a> and <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 17.1</a>. 
    The manifest contains 39 trucks of which the last one was added in handwriting 
    although there were actually 40 onboard according to the Customs List - see 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/17.1.213.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    17.1.213</a>. This list had been in the hands of the Finnish police since 
    14.10.94 already, however it is unknown when it was sent to Sweden. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, Stenström must have had in the early 
    days some other manifest or list or information because by fax of 30.11.94 
    he informed SSPA (Ship Model Testing Facility) that there had been 34 trucks/trailers 
    onboard only - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc5/38.3.462.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    38.3.462</a> and this went into the weight calculations for the first model 
    tests in the tank to establish the wave load on the visor/and the locking 
    devices. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection attention has also to be drawn 
    to a further mistake made in this above-mentioned fax about weight distribution 
    because Stenström wrote: <i>"tanks 13 + 14 (starboard and port heeling tanks) 
    183 ts"</i>. He means though - according to his own statement during his first 
    visit to Papenburg on 27 October 1994 - that the port heeling tank - no. 14 
    - had been completely filled with 183 ts., while the starboard tank had been 
    left empty - see also <a href="chapter17.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    17.1</a> and <a href="29.5.htm" target="_blank">29.5</a>. In a stability and 
    trim calculation received earlier, performed by Ship Consulting Oy, Turku 
    on behalf of the Finnish JAIC and dated 01.12.94 - see Enclosure 38.3 - <b>both</b> 
    heeling tanks are stated to have been filled completely with 185 ts each plus 
    <b>34</b> trailers. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By fax of 10 March Börje Stenström had already 
    distributed his "Draft Technical Report", the forerunner to the Part-Report, 
    among other things also to Dr. Holtappels. Already on the following day the 
    conclusions - pointing, of course, to Papenburg - could be read in "DAGENS 
    NYHETER" and the Berlin paper "TAZ". It revealed subsequently that the Sea 
    Safety Director of Sjöfarts-verket, Bengt-Erik Stenmark, had given a copy 
    to DAGENS NYHETER and the Estonian JAIC member Uno Laur had sold a copy to 
    TAZ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same day Jutta Rabe from SPIEGEL TV 
    interviewed Börje Stenström in his Stockholm office and after respective questions 
    Stenström admitted to have personally thrown overboard the bolt of the Atlantic 
    lock - see also the<a href="37.2.htm" target="_blank"> Subchapter 37.2.</a> 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the further interview he was asked 
    whether they had examined the visor and the wreck for ice damage and his reply 
    was:<i> "We had no indications for ice damage: it was a rather mild winter 
    (he had been shown the ice charts only 3 weeks before) and there were no indications 
    for such damage. At least, as far as we know</i>", and further:<i> "Anyway, 
    I believe that possible ice damage has not been examined, however, I am not 
    quite sure. A good question you are raising. We should possible check that."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> In this context it has to be mentioned that 
    a member of this 'Group of Experts' attended the hearings of several crew 
    survivors as technical consultant of a German TV team and this was the first 
    time that direct questions could be asked to key witnesses. One of the results 
    was the drawing made by the survivor Henrik Sillaste about his observations 
    on the monitor in the engine control room after the big heel. The drawing 
    - see Enclosure 21.2.4 - shows the bow ramp in slightly open condition with 
    water pressing through the gaps at both sides under pressure, however, more 
    at starboard side. The drawing, confirmed by the other two survivors from 
    the engine control room, Margus Treu and Hannes Kadak - see <a href="21.2.3.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    21.2.3</a> and <a href="21.2.5.htm" target="_blank">21.2.5 </a>- proved that 
    the bow ramp had still been closed or almost closed after the big heel, while 
    according to the casualty scenario of the JAIC, the big heel was caused by 
    huge water quantities having entered the car deck after the bow ramp had been 
    pulled completely open by the forward tumbling visor. This was evidently wrong 
    because the bow ramp was still been in the almost closed position when Sillaste 
    and Kadak left the engine control room at a list of 30°/40°. From the very 
    beginning of their testimonies Treu, Sillaste and Kadak have testified this 
    water penetration at both sides of the bow ramp after the big heel. This was 
    also reported in SVENSKA DAGBLADET and DAGENS NYHETER during the early days, 
    however, unfortunately was ignored by the JAIC.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the "Draft Technical Report" of the JAIC 
    which was analysed in detail by this 'Group of Experts'. After considerable 
    discussions it was agreed not to comment on this draft report since it was 
    out anyway and, in particular, since the JAIC was under no circumstances prepared 
    to change its substance in preparation of the Part Report due to be published 
    in early April. Instead Dr. Holtappels gave an interview to Lloyd's List which 
    was published in the 17 March issue and reads as:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"German Yard inquiry 
      finds lock system was altered MEYER WERFT HITS BACK ON 'ESTONIA' An investigation 
      into the loss of the Baltic ferry 'Estonia' by the German yard which built 
      her is set to counter Swedish press claims that a weak lock was responsible 
      for the disaster. Meyer Werft, which is due to publish its first findings 
      early next week, will claim that safety indicators had been tampered with 
      and that the 'Estonia' was operating on a route where she would not have 
      been. Lawyer and former shipowner Peter Holtappels, who heads the commission, 
      said the findings would shed "a very different light" on the tragic accident 
      than the impression given by parts of the report of the international commission 
      published by the Swedish media. The preliminary German report claims that 
      the safety indicators on the bridge showing whether the bow visor was locked 
      had been tampered with to display permanent "green". It also alleges that 
      the sensors on the major device, the Atlantic lock, had been removed. Dr. 
      Holtappels declined to comment further on the claims but insisted that "the 
      ship set sail from Tallinn in an unseaworthy condition" </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">On 6 April the representatives 
    of the relatives were informed in Stockholm by the Swedish JAIC about the 
    contents and conclusions of the Part-Report, i.e. that the sequence-of-events 
    which led to the capsizing and sinking of the ESTONIA had been initiated by 
    the failure of the locking devices of the visor, in particular the Atlantic 
    lock. Allegedly the locking system had been 50 per cent under-dimensioned. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any questions concerning speed, behaviour of 
    the crew, organisation of owners/managers were not answered with reference 
    to the Final Report to be published by the end of the year. On the following 
    day the Part-Report was introduced simultaneously in press conferences by 
    the JAIC parts in Tallinn, Helsinki and Stockholm and copies were distributed 
    to the media. In the introduction letter to the Part-Report Stenström states 
    among other things: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The full report, covering 
      also operational aspects and other outstanding matters is expected to be 
      published in the autumn of this year. The Commission is fully aware of the 
      disadvantages of publishing a part report that deals with only one segment 
      of the circumstances contributing to the accident. It has, however, been 
      assumed to be of value to make the present findings available at an early 
      stage to all sectors of the maritime world, working with various aspects 
      of the safety of passengers ships."</i></font></p>

      "Part-Report Concerning Technical Issues on the Capsizing on 28 September 
      1994 in the Baltic Sea of the Ro-Ro Passenger Vessel M.V. Estonia" reads 
      as follows:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>" The bow visor locking 
      devices failed due to loads generated by the hydrodynamic forces on the 
      bow visor at the prevailing speed, heading and wave conditions. </i></font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The visor locking

    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> Following failure 
      of the locking devices the visor pounded heavily on the stem structure before

      and passengers.</i></font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i> The failure of the 
      bow visor caused the ramp to be forced open due to mechanical interference 
      between the visor and the ramp, inherent in the design. This design arrangement 
      had crucial consequences for the development of the accident." </i> </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">The previous hypothesis had 
    become "conclusion" now and the JAIC made it quite clear in the Preface to 
    the "Part-Report" that it was not their intention ever to change these "conclusions" 
    when they stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"The Commission has 
      previously concluded that the accident was initiated by the locking devices 
      for the bow visor being unable to withstand the loads imposed during the 
      prevailing speed, heading and sea conditions. This conclusion is still valid. 
      This part-report covers main technical findings and conclusions. The final 
      report to be issued later will cover also all other factors and circumstances 
      found to have contributed to the development of the accident. This will 
      include inter alia operational practices, certification and inspections, 
      stability information, weather conditions and train-ing. Rescue operations 
      and resources will be covered as well." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">In other words, whatever 
    the investigation ahead, for example of "<i>operational practices</i>" and 
    "<i>inspections</i>", might reveal "<i>it is anticipated that all facts and 
    conclusions reported herein (the visor locking devices were calculated with 
    less strength than required according to calculations) remain unchanged in 
    substance</i>". "<i>Operational practices</i>" for example includes the forcing 
    of ice barriers several meters high at sea with full speed and the respective 
    affect on the locking devices, the hinges and the visor structure in general, 
    just to mention one example. For more examples see <a href="12.4.htm" target="_blank">Subchapters 
    12.4</a> and <a href="12.5.htm" target="_blank">12.5.</a> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Stenström continued with considerable energy 
    to distribute his "present findings" - the term in itself implies that the 
    findings are not final - to the maritime world by giving papers, for example 
    at the IMO meeting on 31.10.94 and at the Marine Safety Seminar of the Cologne 
    Re in Rotterdam - in 1995 - when he submitted his "present" findings as firmly 
    established facts. He said in Rotterdam under the heading:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>MS Estonia</b> 
      <br>
      1. Aspects of Human Shortcomings <br>
      Sorting out the various contributory factors, it is obvious that the structural 
      strength of the bow visor, the sea conditions and the speed of the vessel 
      all contributed, and any one of these factors could be seen as triggering 
      the catastrophe or could have prevented it. In the prevailing sea conditions 
      two basic factors remain: The design of the locking device of the bow visor 
      was too weak, and the speed of the vessel was too high under the prevailing 
      conditions. The systems' inadequacies may be divided into three groups: 
      Technical inadequacies, regulatory inadequacies and operational inadequacies.<br>
      2. Technical inadequacies<br>
      On the technical side, the classification rules valid at the time, and in 
      particular those according to which the ship was built, were not very detailed 
      and did not contain sufficient guidance for the design of the visor attachment 
      devices. The shipyard designer did the best he could with the advice available 
      and the result of his work would have been reasonably acceptable, albeit 
      at the lower end of the scale. The manufacturing side of the shipyard, however, 
      acted on quite different and unqualified information and built locking arrangements 
      for the visor which had less than half the strength of the outcome of the 
      calculation work. The visor attachment arrangements therefore had a total 
      strength to failure of about one third to one half of what it should have 
      had based on the knowledge of the sea loads at the time. The locking devices 
      then failed under conditions equivalent to the assumed design load conditions. 
      Such loads existed as extreme values under the prevailing speed and sea 
      conditions. If the shipyard had had a quality assurance system similar to 
      the current requirements under ISO 9000 there would have been routine procedures 
      ensuring that the manufacturing was carried out on the basis of correct 
      information." </i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Regardless of all this the 
    exchange of information, the communication between this 'Group of Experts' 
    and the JAIC, especially Stenström, continued and was even deepened during 
    the coming months after Prof. Dr. Hoffmeister had become a consultant to this 
    'Group of Experts' in metallurgical matters. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason for the engagement of Prof. 
    Dr. Hoffmeister of the University of the Armed Forces in Hamburg was the obvious 
    attitude of the JAIC to state that the fractures of the locking devices and 
    hinges had been caused in the overload mode while even the layman could see 
    fatigue cracks at different vital places. Another reason was that the visor 
    had to be examined in detail by a qualified metallurgist. In the course of 
    the following weeks Prof. Hoffmeister closely inspected the visor and the 
    parts already cut off and recovered from the wreck. After some time a relatively 
    close co-operation developed with Prof. Kjell Pettersson from KTH, Stockholm, 
    who had performed the metallurgical examination on behalf of the JAIC. The 
    results of the investigations by Prof. Hoffmeister were laid down in draft 
    reports nos. 1 to 4. Draft report no. 4 is still valid, because Prof. Hoffmeister 
    is still expecting parts from the wreck for examination which would enable 
    him to make final conclusions. <br>
    <b>Note</b>: The owners have repeatedly refused to let Prof. Hoffmeister have 
    the parts in their possession for his examination. Simultaneously the exchange 
    of views and information with Börje Stenström continued more or less uninterrupted. 
    On 21 April there was a further meeting between Stenström and a member of 
    this 'Group of Experts' when a complete set of photos made of the visor and 
    the foundations of both visor actuators were handed over to Stenström with 
    interpretation. Stenström's attention was drawn to the accumulation of oil 
    in the forepart of the 3rd stringer indicating that either the vessel must 
    have had a forward trim more or less all the time and/or the visor had been 
    misaligned in relation to the vessel possibly due to a pressed in stempost. 
    Furthermore Stenström's attention was drawn to the fact that the port visor 
    actuator was no more connected to the B-deck at the time of the casualty. 
    He was only mildly interested, but told the story of the Landvetter meeting 
    instead:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"All the main witnesses 
      were questioned again - especially watch A.B. Silver Linde - however, in 
      the presence of Enn Neidre, the superior of all ESCO sailors, which was 
      regrettable but unavoidable because Neidre insisted and he was a JAIC member. 
      The main aim of this meeting had been to find out what had happened on the 
      bridge, why they had been so passive. According to Silver Linde the 2nd 
      and 3rd officers had left the bridge after 01.00-01.05 hours, thus at that 
      time they considered everything to be normal and routine. About 5 or 10 
      minutes later the vessel suddenly took a starboard list of about 20° and 
      started a sharp port turn which increased the starboard heel. It seemed 
      possible that the 2nd and 4th, mates, then on the bridge, were knocked off 
      their feet and became unconscious. Then probably the (other) 2nd mate and 
      the 3rd mate returned to the bridge, transmitted "Mayday" and "Mr. Skylight 
      to No. 1 & 2" and asked the engine room whether it was possible to pump 
      over water to the high side. Survivors have confirmed that the lee side 
      was the high side. A port turn has also been confirmed by the position of 
      lost objects found on the sea bottom. Silver Linde had stated that when 
      he was ordered to check the ramp to take the boatswain with him. The passenger 
      who heard the hydraulic sound was midships on 4th deck - they believe he 
      heard the stabilisers. There are no indications that they used the hydraulic 
      actuators to hold down the visor."</i></font></p>

    meeting. See also Subchapters <a href="21.2.2.htm" target="_blank">21.2.2</a>,

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Part-Report was discussed 
    and Stenström's attention was drawn to the many mistakes, e.g. the <i>"disappeared 
    stempost"</i> and the impossibility that the control lights were all green 
    if the port lower bolt of the bow ramp had not engaged the pocket, etc. Finally 
    Stenström was asked, why did they state in the Part-Report that <i>"in all 
    probability the sequence of events and cause consideration will not be changed"</i> 
    because evidently they had not even covered 10% of the required investigation 
    extent. After some thinking, Stenström said: <i>"These are our instructions 
    and please don't ask us any more questions in this respect. We had to draft 
    our report to the effect that the blame is more or less entirely resting with 
    Meyer Werft, however, in the Final Report we shall draft it so vaguely that 
    there will be not enough evidence to commence legal action against the yard, 
    in other words, after our Final Report has come out, nobody can be blamed 
    and the case will be closed shortly afterwards"</i>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the following weeks and the 
    ongoing exchange of views and information Stenström admitted that his Part-Report 
    was wrong in some respects, however, when it came to water in the visor, which 
    evidently had been there, he was not prepared to give in. After this 'Group 
    of Experts' had written, on 16 June:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"As to water in the 
      visor which was flowing out once the vessel had reduced speed and the bow-wave 
      became smaller we do not mean the crewmen of the pilot boat, but some Stockholm 
      pilots who have observed the above, and they are not talking about just 
      150 litres. On the other hand the fact that at sea the inside of the visor 
      was filled up to outside level with water due to poor or missing rubberseals 
      was admitted by Ulf Hobro at our discussion in your presence mid February."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Stenström replied already 
    on 22 June:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"I think there is nobody 
      claiming that the space inside the visor was dry. It is not even required 
      to be watertight by their rules. In a seaway water will be pushed in through 
      any leaking seals at a higher rate than it would flow out when the bow rises 
      out of the water and some water may have been there in bad weather. Please 
      consider, how-ever, that the ramp seals were probably not 100 per cent watertight 
      either, in particular not at the lower edge due to some play in the hinges 
      and the fact that one locking wedge had not found its way fully into its 
      female part. Any steady level of water inside the visor should therefore 
      undoubtedly leak past the ramp into the car deck area. The area was inspected 
      regularly, even shortly before the accident, and there was no water in the 
      ramp area. Have therefore difficulties in believing in the existence of 
      any large amount of water in the visor that could have influenced the dynamics 
      of the visor in a seaway."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> Of course Stenström could 
    under no circumstances accept large quantities of water inside the visor because 
    at that time he knew already of the partly open bow ramp at the port lower 
    corner which meant water on the car deck which evidently had been the case 
    already in 1993 - see <a href="12.4.4.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 12.4.4</a>, 
    especially the statement of pilot Bo Söderman - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.4.161.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.4.161</a>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also another principle matter was seen differently 
    by Stenström and this 'Group of Experts', viz. the non-recorded respectively 
    non-documented repairs. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"<b>4. Visor Structure 
      </b><br>
      You might have good control about the documented repairs ,but what abut 
      the ones not documented? Who has and when carried out the highly insufficient 
      repairs to lower lugs at B-Deck of the port actuator (hydraulic cylinder), 
      just to mention one example? These repairs as well as changing of bushings 
      of the visor hinges e.g. are subject to class inspection and repair approval, 
      which, as you know, has not been the case." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström replied:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><i>"It is quite possible, 
      and normal onboard any ship, that small defects are repaired onboard, e.g. 
      the crack in the stiffener underneath the port side platform for the lifting 
      actuator. Replacing a hinge bushing is a different things, that would be 
      a considerable undertaking even at a shipyard and can certainly not be undertaken 
      whilst in service. There are no indications in all the records we have examined 
      of such a repair, superintendents and other people who have followed the 
      ship also deny that any such work should have been carried out. Why should 
      it have been done secretly if there had been a need??? In case there had 
      been a need to remove the bushing, burning off the old weld would undoubtedly 
      have resulted in burning marks in tangential direction on the plating around 
      the weld. There are no such marks. The cutting marks in the holes are perfectly 
      perpen-dicular to the plate and cannot be generated by burning on an existing 
      completed installation. Had there been a need for repair due to play, the 
      old bronze bushing would undoubtedly have been removed by local machining. 
      This is shipyard standard practice for relining any worn shaft bushing from 
      propeller shaft bearings down to small diameters. As all four visor arm 
      side plates have identical appearance, would you suggest that all four bushings 
      were replaced by the crew in secrecy? The hinge bushing was inspected by 
      Professor Hoffmeister last week and we had a few more sections cut and examined 
      according to his desire. I hope he got the information he was looking for 
      and will appreciate a copy of his report. The extra work has been done on 
      behalf of the SHK as it is in our interest as well to find maximum amount 
      of facts." </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Stenström made it quite clear 
    that the JAIC was of the definite opinion that the deep burning marks were 
    caused by the yard already at newbuilding and did not hesitate to tell that 
    also to the media. He was, however, wrong in almost all respects, because:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2"> - at the starboard hinges 
    were indications of tangential burning marks although covered by the welding 
    seams; <br>
    - the perpendicular burning marks can very well be generated by burning on 
    an existing completed installation as it was proved by a respective test carried 
    out by Meyer Werft in summer 1995 - see the photo below and see also <a href="chapter30.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
    30</a> - S3/P3. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/report%20pics/partc/Page122.jpg" width="462" height="392"></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">- all four arms do not have 
    identical appearances as it is evident from the two photos below, the left 
    one shows the port outer visor arm and the right one the starboard inner visor 
    arm.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/report%20pics/partc/Page%20123.jpg" width="493" height="357"></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana" size="2">Evidently the starboard visor 
    arm plate looks identical to the test burnt installation part - see the photo 
    above - and the port one is smooth without burning marks at all. A detailed 
    inspection even revealed indications of circumferential drilling marks as 
    initially the holes were drilled at newbuilding - see <a href="2.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Subchapter 
    2.4.6</a>. Therefore this 'Group of Experts' has always taken and still does 
    take the view that the port bushings were still original while the starboard 
    ones were very unprofessionally replaced. How gross negligently this replacement 
    was carried out became fully clear when a passenger video was made available 
    to this 'Group of Experts' in 1996 - see Subchapter 39.2. </font></p>

    The August Meeting </b></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">The investigations went on 
    and after some time it was felt that another meeting with the JAIC should 
    be held, preferably in Hamburg, however due to the health problems of Börje

    Prof. Hoffmeister would present his findings. <br>

    Dipl. Ing. Tomas Wilkendorf Captain Werner Hummel </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">This 'Group of Experts' presented 
    their findings and the sequence-of-events supported by the metallurgical evaluations 
    of Prof. Hoffmeister, all of which was discussed at the end.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana"> - The JAIC admitted that 
    the visor was already substantially damaged when the vessel departed from 
    Tallinn.<br>
    - The JAIC admitted that the visor hinges were considerably weakened by fatigue.<br>
    - The JAIC admitted that the existing poor condition of the hinges and locking 
    devices does not necessarily result from bad performance of the new-building 
    yard if no repair work was found to be documented or otherwise recorded. <br>
    - It was agreed that Prof. Hoffmeister should make further detailed examinations 
    of the hinges and Atlantic lock parts in close cooperation with KTH Stockholm 
    and VTT Helsinki. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">Finally, Dr. Holtappels indicated 
    that the JAIC had to be considered biased due to the presence of the head 
    of the Navigation Department of ESCO in the Commission, because ESCO having 
    been 50% owner and crew manager of the ESTONIA was one of the subjects of 
    the ongoing investigation. This was received by the audience in silence.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana">In summary it could be concluded 
    that the JAIC got the message that their scenario was not necessarily the 
    only one and that other circumstances had played a dominant role in the sinking 
    of the ESTONIA and, further, that this 'Group of Experts' was not prepared 
    to accept that the "scenario and main findings" of the Part-Report would remain 
    "unchanged in substance". In those days this 'Group of Experts' still believed 
    that the JAIC - being a governmental institution - wanted to find out the 
    truth, maybe apart from the Estonians, however, the first shadows of doubt 
    arose in particular created by the behaviour of Börje Stenström. </font></p>
