  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Chief engineer Lars 
    Karlsson arrived already at Papenburg three days after the contract was signed 
    together with Captain Brunström (who was replaced five weeks later by Lars 
    Mäkki, the subsequent master of VIKING SALLY), 1st engineer Stig Strömberg 
    and electrician Lars Sjögren. He had been in Papenburg already as owners' 
    representative during the building of VIKING 3, 4 & 5, thus knew the Yard 
    as well as the people including the B.V. inspectors (all vessels were classed 
    by B.V.), spoke some German and was therefore nominated as "coordinator" of 
    owners' superintendents. He stayed until the delivery and subsequently became 
    chief engineer on VIKING SALLY. Apart from the usual leave periods he remained 
    in that position until 30.03.92. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following is 
    an abstract of his statement concerning the building phase:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>«Three days 
      after signing of the contract I came to Papenburg together with Capt. Brunström 
      (was relieved after 5 weeks by Lars Mäkki), 1st engineer Stig Strömberg, 
      and electrician Lars Sjögren. At the beginning I had only 1 small GA plan, 
      deck and engine specifications were shown to me.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due 
      to pressure of time we had to make a lot of compromises. In my opinion and 
      experience the Meyer Werft was the only yard in Europe able to do such a 
      job because of so little bureaucracy. This has, in my opinion, nothing to 
      do with the catastrophe. Meyer Werft has very much experience. They have 
      built all ships very strong, i.e. they were usually heavy. It is a well 
      known fact that Meyer ships were stronger and behaved better in ice compared 
      to e.g. Wärtsilä ships. <br>
      With my team of supervisors I checked everything including, and in particular, 
      weldings in close co-operation with B.V. surveyor Lohmann and his colleague. 
      As far as I remember Lohmann was more active on VIKING 1-5, whilst on VIKING 
      SALLY he was the boss and the other one did the routine work. Anyway Lohmann 
      was always present when major items, such as ramp and visor, were presented 
      by the yard and tested.<br>
      My best contacts were Mr. Motikat and Mr. Wahnes. F.B.N representatives 
      came from time to time, however, all paperwork was done by the Sally office 
      in Mariehamn directly with F.B.N. Helsinki. I did some inspections with 
      F.B.N. representatives in Papenburg, e.g.</font></i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - stairways, 
        lifts;<br>
        - boats, liferafts, etc.<br>
        - fire doors, fire-fighting equipment, etc.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Chief officer 
      Lindström came about 3 months before delivery. I also inspected visor/ramp 
      etc. I checked the visor during building together with the 1st engineer. 
      It was very hectic during the last days before launching because there were 
      delays in delivery of equipment from Sweden due to a strike in this country. 
      After launching the visor was lifted ashore again. It was before only welded 
      to the vessel by steel-bars. At present I do not remember details of the 
      bearing/bushing system of visor hinges. <br>
      </font></i><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      bow ramp was considered to be the collision bulkhead same as on all the 
      predecessors built by Meyer Werft, but also the same as on e.g. TURELLA, 
      ROSELLA, VIKING SONG, VIKING SAGA, and many other ferries.<br>
      </font></i><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 
      car deck there were 4 cameras installed, i.e. 1 forward to the forward ramp, 
      2 at the sides and 1 looking aft to the stern ramp. The cameras could be 
      moved and had also zoom ability. Monitors were on the bridge (located at 
      port side of the entrance to the chart room) and in the engine control room 
      (ECR) above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor 
      could be changed to another camera either manually or automatically. The 
      monitors on bridge and in ECR were showing the same picture. The main monitor 
      with operating sticks was in the ECR, i.e. the bridge could not change to 
      another camera.« </font></i></p>
