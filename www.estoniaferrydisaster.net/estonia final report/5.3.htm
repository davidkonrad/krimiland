    The NORD ESTONIA - Captain Per Ringhagen</b></font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In 
    January 1990 Captain Per Ringhagen joined Estline AB Stockholm together with 
    his colleague Captain Sten Levander. Both were employed as masters for the 
    Swedish flagged car/passenger ferry NORD ESTONIA ex DANA REGINA.</font></font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At that time Nordström 
      & Thulin (N&T) owned 90% of Estline AB, Stockholm, whilst 10% were owned 
      by the Estonian government owned transport company Tallinn Autobussi Kondis 
      and by the Ministry of Transport. In Tallinn there was also a company registered 
      by the name of Estline EESTI which, however, was owned 90% by the above-mentioned 
      Estonian share-holders and only 10% by N&T.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the first 
      4-5 months of their employment with Estline, Stockholm it was the primary 
      task of the two captains to </font></p>

      2.) select and employ two complete crews;</font></div>
    <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 
      3.) develop safety and other manuals for the ship. </font></div>

      They had selected and assisted in the construction of the Ro-Ro berth in 
      the port of Tallinn where at first NORD ESTONIA, subsequently ESTONIA were 
      and now MARE BALTICUM is berthing. At that time Estonia was still under 
      Russian Regime, but they had an excellent co-operation with Estline and 
      the Terminal employees.</font></div>

  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They 
      had some rooms in the N&T office in Stockholm where they were working with 
      the senior staff employed first, i.e. officers, engineers, and catering. 
      The chief officers also came from Silja. They were Karl Karell (stayed with 
      N&T as nautical adviser on ESTONIA and subsequently MARE BALTICUM, now probably 
      superintendent) and Kjell Kereby (now sailing on Norwegian tankers). The 
      2nd officers were Nils Wigström, Karl Rosen, Juri Aavik, Christian Nordström. 
      Juri Aavik succeeded Anders Andersson as nautical adviser on the ESTONIA 
      was on board during the casualty voyage and did not survive.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of the 
      engineers was Per Erik Kjellström. He sailed as chief engineer on NORD ESTONIA 
      until she was finally sold as THOR HEYERDAHL. He is now probably technical 
      inspector for MARE BALTICUM.</font></div>

  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">They 
      developed completely new safety plans and all other arrangements necessary 
      to operate a car/passenger ferry of the NORD ESTONIA dimension between 2 
      countries, one of which then still being ruled by the USSR. They had absolutely 
      no support from the owning company N&T. </font></div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    decision to buy DANA REGINA was made by N&T already in October 1989, i.e. 
    long time before Per Ringhagen came into the picture.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After 
    the take-over of the DANA REGINA, in March 1990, the vessel was shifted to 
    Cityvarvet, Gothenburg, where she stayed for several weeks.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Substantial 
    changes were effected, among other things, the bridge layout was changed to 
    the effect that the vessel could be operated on the co-pilot system. The bridge 
    had open wings.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From 
    N&T Sten-Christer Forsberg was in Gothenburg more or less all the time together 
    with Ulf Hobro, then safety inspector employed by Sjöfartsverket and subsequently 
    responsible for the ESTONIA.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
    most important changes were made in respect of fire-fighting and smoke detection 
    (this was only couple of months after the SCANDINAVIAN STAR disaster and the 
    maritime authorities were very sensitive). Both crews were on board at Gothenburg 
    and trained in fire-fighting, escape, etc. The ship had to pass numerous safety 
    inspections by Sjöfartsverket in order to get the new PSSC. At sea between 
    Gothenburg and Stockholm lifeboat and fire-fighting drills and evacuation 
    exercises were carried out.</font></div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 
    Stockholm the owners obtained the new PSSC confirming that the vessel complied 
    with SOLAS 1974 without any exemption, although it was known to Sjöfartsverket 
    that she would trade between Stockholm and Tallinn, i.e. more than 20 nm from 
    the nearest land and she did not have the upper extension of the collision 
    bulkhead in a position as required by SOLAS.</font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b></font></p>
  </div>
  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>According 
      to Captain Ringhagen this had also been the case with one of his previous 
      employments, the car/passenger ferry SVEA CORONA. This vessel was subsequently 
      transferred to the US west coast and renamed SUNDANCER. After arrival in 
      the first US port the vessel was at once inspected quite carefully by the 
      US Coast Guard in accordance with Port State Control Regulations. It was 
      immediately discovered that the ferry did not have a properly located upper 
      extension of the collision bulkhead above bulkhead deck and have a "partial 
      collision door" at the location required by SOLAS 1974, had to be installed 
      before the ferry received permission to commence trading with US passengers.</i></font></div>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T 
    went through the rather costly and lengthy procedure of fulfilling all requirements 
    of Sjöfartsverket to obtain the new PSSC and to change to Swedish flag. As 
    stated it was Ulf Hobro, who as responsible Sjöfartsverket inspector, confirmed 
    that the vessel complied with SOLAS 1974, although she did not. DANA REGINA 
    was renamed NORD ESTONIA, commenced trading on 16.06.1990 between Stockholm 
    and Tallinn and stayed in this service until the beginning of February 1993 
    when she was replaced by the ESTONIA. </font></div>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was not possible 
      for this 'Group of Experts' to obtain information from N&T and/or ESCO masters/officers 
      about the practical aspects of berthing/ unberthing in Tallinn and Stockholm 
      as well as proceeding through the Stockholm archipelago/dealing with pilots, 
      tugs, etc. Therefore the respective experience gained by the NORD ESTONIA 
      as stated by Captain Per Ringhagen, shall be outlined as follows:</font></p>

        had a restriction of 15 m/sec. for Sandhamn, if the wind exceeded the 
        restriction the ferries had to go through Söderarm, the Sandhamn entrance

        - They met 25/28 m/sec. and more winds several times and the vessel arrived 
        with several hours delay. Experience has shown that the Baltic is more 
        aggressive, i.e. has shorter, steeper seas than the Kattegatt or North 
        Sea.</font></div>

          side to have from the beginning a sort of counter weight to the wind
