      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
      selection and employment of officers and ratings was performed by ESCO, 
      who had to supply vessel's crew according to the management contract with 
      E-Line. ESCO was responsible for competence control and for vessel-specific 
      education. The N&T organisation took an active part through Sten-Christer 
      Forsberg and Ulf Hobro in selecting the masters, chief officers and chief 
      engineers. In addition to requiring formal and practical competence and 
      qualification, N&T also required that the top people should also be able 
      to communicate in English, and in particular, that the respective masters 
      and chief officers had experience with passenger ferries / Ro-Ro traffic.<br>
      M.V. ESTONIA was taken over from her previous owners at the shipyard in 
      Turku, there the Estonian crew took possession of the vessel, the on board 
      organisation was established and the necessary work to adjust the vessel 
      to Estline's traffic was carried out. Finnish speaking personnel from the 
      previous owners Wasa Line (chief officer, 1st engineer, electrician, and 
      2 repairmen) were hired from the start of the new traffic for between 21/2 
      and 5 months to assist their Estonian successors with practical advice in 
      dealing with the vessel's specific systems. This principle was always followed 
      by the Operations Organisation of N&T when taking over vessels, independently 
      of flag or nationality of crew. <br>
      One of N&T's ferry-experienced masters, Anders Andersson, assisted N&T's 
      organisation in preparation work for about 2 months before the vessel was 
      taken over and stayed on board the vessel for the first 51/2 months. His 
      main task was to give practical advice to the Estonian master in respect 
      of navigation in the Stockholm archipelago and manoeuvring in port, but 
      also in respect of cargo and stowage planning, and other traffic related 
      questions.« </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The responsible superintendent 
    from Nordström & Thulin, Ulf Hobro, was interviewed by the criminal police 
    Stockholm on 22.11.94 when he testified as quoted below:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Mr. Hobro 
      participated in the selection of master and chief engineer for the ESTONIA. 
      He considered that the Master was qualified. He had many years of experience 
      in passenger traffic between Tallinn and Helsinki. Also the chief engineer 
      had worked on board vessels routed between Tallinn and Helsinki. <b>The 
      crew was, according to Mr. Hobro, as good as a Swedish crew</b>.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Naturally those responsible 
    for the education, selection and training of the crew must have - at least 
    externally - a good opinion of those whom they have selected, which, however, 
    is by no means shared by all the insiders. Actually Captain Andresson had 
    been master onboard GEORG OTTS for 8 months, chief officer for 10 months and 
    2nd officer for 10 months, i.e. in total 28 months. Bearing in mind that two 
    crews relieved each other every 2 weeks, the time onboard is only 50%, i.e. 
    14 months and certainly not many years, as Hobro told the police.</font></p>

    for the crew of the ESTONIA was in general two weeks' service on board, followed 
    by two weeks ashore. Consequently two full crews were employed alternately 
    and all positions on board were held by two persons. In the deck department 
    there were, besides the master, five deck officers, one radio officer and 
    eight ratings. Organisationwise the ship's doctor was also a member of the 
    deck crew. The engine department consisted of eight engineers and eight ratings. 
    In the catering department there were eight positions with officer's status

  The first - and last - master and his adviser</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The first 
    master of the ESTONIA was selected by ESCO, and apparently also by N&T, to 
    be Arvo Andresson, the second captain for the first two months was the elderly 
    Captain Rain Erlach, of whom nothing is known. He was replaced by Avo Piht 
    who relieved Arvo Andresson in two-week intervals until the last voyage, when 
    he was on board, but not in command, and who has been considered "missing" 
    ever since. The first - and at the beginning only - "nautical adviser" was 
    Anders Andersson, a well qualified and experienced Swedish ferry master. The 
    reason for his employment was:</font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">N&T wanted to know 
    what was going on onboard; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">at first, none of 
    the Estonian masters, Andresson and Piht, had pilot licenses, thus they had 
    to take a state pilot in the Stockholm archipelago, but in addition one holder 
    of a pilot license had to be on board and that was the nautical adviser;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> the Estonians were 
    inexperienced in almost every respect, i.e. loading and securing of trucks, 
    ballasting the tanks accordingly, safety matters, nautical matters, etc. </font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After several months 
    increasing tension developed between Andersson and the Estonian officers, 
    in particular, Arvo Andresson, who became known for knowing everything better. 
    Andersson was consequently replaced by Juri Aavik (did not survive) and Karl 
    Karell (now nautical superintendent of N&T). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The situation 
    and the atmosphere on board during the first months in service can probably 
    best be demonstrated by an extract from the book <b>"Katastrofen Kurs"</b> 
    by Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg. Anders Hellberg, who spoke in length 
    with Anders Andersson, reports as a result of this discussion in Chapter 11 
    of the book:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Arrogant, nonchalant 
      and not very competent <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Arvo 
      Andresson, Master of "Estonia", was in many respects an extraordinary master. 
      He took care that discipline and order on board were properly upheld. However, 
      he had a little problem: He mixed up port and starboard. He, as well as 
      his relief Avo Piht, were described as little Gods on board. Under the old 
      Russian system, of which practically the entire crew was a product, the 
      master's word or orders were never questioned. In particular during his 
      absence this could become quite serious. On board a vessel certain things 
      have to be carried out immediately in order not to endanger the safety. 
      But if the master was not present and could not be asked, the result could 
      be that nothing at all was done. It was better to do nothing instead of 
      doing something which could cause the master to see red. Such a system certainly 
      has its advantages, if the master is fully competent. But was Captain Arvo 
      Andresson fully competent? This is questioned by someone who has worked 
      with Andresson.<br>
      When the Estonian Shipping Company ESCO took over "Estonia" the Swedish 
      part owner of Estline, N&T, employed a number of advisers, actually assistant 
      masters and crew members working in other functions, who were to train and 
      control the Estonian crew members to make sure that they really knew what 
      they were doing.<br>
      Initially N&T wanted to have a Swedish master, chief officer and chief engineer 
      for the vessel, although sailing under Estonian flag, however, ESCO refused 
      to accept that. Instead, the Swedish "advisers" were employed. <br>
      One of the Swedish assistant masters, Anders Andersson, worked for quite 
      some time with Arvo Andresson. He has described the Estonian master to the 
      Joint Accident Investigation Commission as having been arrogant and nonchalant, 
      and having strictly upheld discipline and the hierarchy on board. He pursued 
      this so rigorously that he even changed the crew in the hotel and restaurant 
      sections, even if the results were catastrophic. The Swedish and Finnish 
      advisers were professionals from Viking, Silja, and Estline's previous vessel 
      "Nord Estonia" in respective positions on board, such as hotel, restaurants, 
      tax free and business shops. This worked very well and effectively until 
      Arvo Andresson changed everything and put incompetent Estonian personnel 
      into management positions, no matter what effect that had on the business 
      results. <br>
      All this was reported to Sten-Christer Forsberg, Technical Manager of N&T, 
      who spoke to Arvo Andresson requesting him not to interfere with matters 
      which he did not understand. To discuss these things with ESCO "was totally 
      useless as they under all circumstances strengthened the position of Arvo 
      Andresson. He had an untouchable position within ESCO".<br>
      When "Estonia" was taken over and Andersson and Andresson met for the first 
      time, Andersson asked Arvo Andresson how he managed the change from "Georg 
      Otts" to "Estonia" and Arvo Andresson just replied "vessel is vessel". This 
      explains a lot about Arvo Andresson because 9 months on the "Georg Otts", 
      a small ferry without much windage sailing between Helsinki and Tallinn, 
      can naturally in no way be a proper preparation for taking over the command 
      of a ferry like "Estonia" with a substantially larger windage and other 
      relevant differences. As a confirmation, the vessel grounded near Sandhamn 
      soon after the service had been opened, because Arvo Andresson had totally 
      underestimated the drifting speed. <br>
      All vessels which regularly call at Stockholm have a wind restriction for 
      the passing of Farfarsgrundet (Sandhamn). The large Silja and Viking ferries 
      do not enter here if the wind speed is in excess of 15 m/sec. from S/SW, 
      then they use the northern entrance (Söderarm). For the considerably smaller 
      "Estonia" the senior pilot of Stockholm had set the limit to 10 m/sec. <br>
      The experience of Arvo Andresson in ferry traffic was restricted to the 
      Helsinki-Tallinn service. There are 3 smaller ferries: "Georg Otts", "Vaana 
      Tallinn" and "Tallink" which go daily both ways. Reportedly these relatively 
      small vessels always used tugs.<br>
      "Estonia" had the highest ice class and 24000 hp, whilst "Georg Otts" was 
      so low powered that they always had to run the engines at full speed against 
      heavy seas or ice in order to make some headway at all. To proceed with 
      "Estonia" against heavy head seas, however, required a lot of experience 
      as otherwise quite some damage could be done to the foreship with such powerful 
      engines. This experience Arvo Andresson did not have. This became obvious 
      rather quickly after the take-over at Turku, when "Estonia" departed and 
      he misjudged the wind completely and used the propellers the wrong way so 
      that the vessel almost hit the quay. Subsequently he admitted to Andersson 
      that he had difficulties with manoeuvring the engines and also mixed up 
      port and starboard.<br>
      Similar incidents happened frequently during the following months. <br>
      According to the Swedish captain the Estonians also never did learn how 
      to properly load the "Estonia". It is important to load a Ro-Ro vessel correctly, 
      both in order to obtain the correct trim in the ballast tanks considering 
      the wind and in order to prevent the vessel from heeling.<br>
      The mates were sitting all afternoon with their cargo plan, only to discover 
      that it did not function when the cars were rolling on board. There were 
      always significant changes in the bookings at the last minute. Then emergency 
      solutions had to be found in order to take all cars on board. Simultaneously, 
      there was an aversion within ESCO against the Swedish interfering on board. 
      <br>
      As master, Arvo Andresson was dominant and authoritarian. The mates never 
      dared even to come close to the sticks (Note: pitch controls), not even 
      the chief officer who normally has to be able to manoeuvre the vessel. Andresson 
      was a product of the Soviet system. Once when he damaged the quay at Frihamn 
      in Stockholm with the aft of the vessel, he did not accept to write a report 
      to the ship owners. "I will be able to persuade my mates to testify that 
      the damages to the quay were already existing when we arrived", he said. 
      <br>
      The Swedish captain describes the difference between an Estonian and a Swedish 
      or Finnish vessel as follows: "On a Swedish ferry the mate first reduces 
      the speed and does thereafter inform the master about what he has done. 
      As regards "Estonia", it was the other way round."<br>
      Generally, there was a poor ability to take initiatives within the crew, 
      probably as a result of the old system. Nobody dared to take his own initiative.«

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The files of the 
    public prosecutor in Stockholm, Tomas Lindstrand, who performed his own investigation, 
    contain the following, additional information in relation to Captain Anders 
    Andersson and his wife Marlene:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andersson had been 
    on the WASA KING since October 1992 to become acquainted with the vessel.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> N&T took over the 
    complete safety organisation from NORD ESTONIA and transferred it without 
    changes to ESTONIA, although this vessel was much larger, had more crew members, 
    for example a radio operator which the NORD ESTONIA did not have. Therefore 
    the ESTONIA radio operator was not mentioned in the safety role and thus had 
    no function in case of emergency.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> His wife Marlene 
    was the restaurant and hotel manager and remained on board until July 1994. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There had been plenty 
    of occurrences with drunken Estonian crew members; in the crew's dayroom it 
    was almost always party time on the last trip to Stockholm before the relief 
    crew would take over on the following day (also on the last voyage).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There were lots 
    of problems with Arvo Andresson who was absolutely unsuitable for passenger 
    vessels; everything was much easier with Avo Piht, who already had experience 
    with Baltic ferries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andresson also 
    had a problem taking decisions by himself since he was always used to having 
    somebody above him. This became drastically obvious in stress situations when 
    quick decisions had to be made. Typical were two occurrences, viz:</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a)</b> A passenger 
    sustained a heart attack at sea and Andresson was totally helpless, did not 
    know what to do and asked Marlene Andersson what he should do.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(b)</b> When 
    60 Iraqis were discovered in a container on the car deck he did not know what 
    to do either or how to behave, phoned his principals in Tallinn and asked 
    what he should do.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Very often relatives 
    of the crew members simply stayed on board in Tallinn for the whole round-trip 
    without being registered and without Arvo Andresson doing anything against 
    it although he knew of it. It was easy for non-crew members to get on board. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Marlene Andersson 
    as well as Arvo Andresson respectively Avo Piht attended the Estline board 
    meetings when they took place on the ESTONIA. Frequently there was an irritated, 
    stressed atmosphere. There were also language problems. The Swedes and Estonians 
    were sometimes shouting at each other. Also Peter Barasinski, an ex restaurant 
    chef on the ESTONIA, has reported that he had been told by his wife Carita, 
    who was a conference hostess on ESTONIA (did not survive), that during the 
    meetings of the Estline Board of Directors, which were held on board the ESTONIA, 
    there had always been clashes and that the N&T and ESCO representatives had 
    shouted at each other in loud voices and with red faces, and that this had 
    been so up to the end.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> So much for Arvo 
    Andresson seen with the eyes of Anders Andersson and his wife. Some of this 
    is confirmed by the Finnish advisers who have told this 'Group of Experts' 
    that it always took unusually long for Andresson to get the vessel alongside 
    and that the berthing manoeuvres were quite often accompanied by impacts. 
    They also recounted that during the first real heavy weather voyage from Tallinn 
    to Stockholm Anders Andersson decided to enter the archipelago at Utö and 
    proceed inside up to Söderarm for the safety and comfort of passengers and 
    crew and, last but not least, the vessel. Reportedly this also led to a major 
    clash with Andresson and ESCO although no time was lost, and, because there 
    was absolutely no support from N&T, was never repeated by Andersson. The Finnish 
    advisers have also stated that at the beginning when the vessel was proceeding 
    too fast against head seas passengers complained to the Information desk, 
    whereafter the girls phoned the bridge and passed on the complaints, but were 
    harshly brushed off and never dared to do it again. (For more details about 
    Captain Arvo Andresson see also Chapter 13.) </font></p>
