  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Margus Treu is one 
    of the three survivors considered by the JAIC to be the key witnesses and, 
    thus, was questioned in detail, however, in the presence of the head of the 
    nautical department of ESCO and safety adviser of ESTLINE, Captain Enn Neidre, 
    who was then still a member of the Estonian part of the JAIC and as such insisted 
    on participating despite the urgent requests of the Swedish and Finnish members 
    to stay home. When the psychological expert of the JAIC, the Swede Bengt Schager, 
    was interviewed by Jutta Rabe of Spiegel TV in this connection, he replied 
    the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> »Q:<i> Hannes 
      Kadak has withdrawn that he saw water coming in at 00.46 hrs, which he withdrew 
      later. He first made a very precise statement and later withdrew it. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: <i>Oh, yes, 
      you mean that statement, yes. Ah, it was revealed during the Landvetter 
      investigation, when I was asking him and I don't have any explanation to 
      what he said, but I was very curious, because first he said that he had 
      thought about it and wasn't sure anymore and 1 minute later he wasn't sure 
      at all whether he had said so at all. So, I don't know what to believe of 
      that. I am in the hands of the witness, sometimes.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Q:<i> But can 
      it be that confusion was caused, that there were people on behalf of the 
      Shipping Company who were employed there, who were also attending that meeting 
      and Mr. Neidre was more or less like a boss for him, and people do get insecure 
      when being asked. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A: (nodding) <i>Yes, 
      and <b>Mr. Neidre was in full uniform as well for the first time that I 
      have seen it. </b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Q: <i><b>But was 
      that very smart?</b></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> A:<b><i> I don't 
      think so, but we had no option, this was the way the Estonians wanted it. 
      Although I had some feelings about it, he was a member of the Commission, 
      I could not say to him, please, I want to talk with him alone. This may 
      have altered some of the responses in the interview, yes.« </i></b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This means that Captain 
    Enn Neidre, working ashore in the ESCO administration for many years, <b>had 
    without doubt deliberately put on his captain's uniform to intimidate the 
    crew witnesses and, looking at the answers they have given, he did it successfully. 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence, 
    Treu said less than he had said in his initial statements and stuck to his 
    impossible wrong timing, on which, however, the JAIC has built up their equally 
    impossible casualty scenario. Margus Treu, who is indeed the key witness, 
    because he apparently saw on the monitor how the bow ramp was struck and broke 
    open, because this is what he told motorman Hannes Kadak in explanation of 
    the water ingress on to the car deck according to the first statement of Kadak 
    made on 29 September 1994 to the Finnish criminal police in Turku when he 
    said:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»- suddenly 
      the vessel heeled to starboard, he ran back to the ECR where Treu was watching 
      the monitor and said:<b> "The situation is serious" or "bad" "because the 
      ramp has been struck and became broken." - </b>saw on the monitor that there 
      were high waves on the car deck and that the water level had already reached 
      the height of the personal cars.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This was not mentioned 
    by any of the JAIC members at the Landvetter meeting, although it concerns 
    one of the topics of the casualty sequence-of-events. The JAIC members instead 
    spent their time with intimidating Kadak to the effect that he withdrew his 
    initial and very precise statement <i>"that at 00.46 hours he saw water penetrating 
    the bow ramp at the upper starboard corner".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In detail:<br>
    <b>(1) on 28.09.94 at 10.03 hours by the Central Criminal Police, Turku:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- felt 3-4 heavy 
      bangs and when the camera turned to the bow, saw very much water entering 
      from that direction;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - immediate heel 
      of 10°-15° (from previously 1°-2°); </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- there was only 
      water on the car deck - not in the engine room;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the main engines 
      shut off - he managed to start the auxiliaries; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- they tried to 
      pump out the water that was entering the ship. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    above short statement implies two circumstances: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) when Treu felt 
    the heavy bangs/blows, the monitor either did not show the bow ramp (because 
    the system was still switched to the rotating mode) or he was somewhere else 
    in the ECR, thus he states: <i>"When the camera turned to the bow, I saw very 
    much water entering from that direction." </i>There might well have been some 
    time between him feeling the impacts and seeing the water penetrate at the 
    bow ramp which does not exclude that at the time of the impacts water was 
    already penetrating the bow ramp. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) Treu states 
    that there was only water on the car deck, not in the engine room, but goes 
    on to say that they tried to pump out the water that was entering the ship. 
    Since it is not possible to pump water from the car deck, water must have 
    been in some compartments in the vessel which were pumpable, i.e. 1st deck 
    and/or 0-deck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) on 28.09.94 
    at 12.00 hours by unknown authority in Turku:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- ca. 01.00 
      hours felt 2 double, hard bangs from forward;</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - 01.15 hours 
      saw on the monitor in the ECR that water was penetrating the car deck via 
      the ramp,<b> at the same time he heard the watch A.B. report about water 
      on car deck;</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - ca. 01.20 hours 
      the bridge asked whether it would be possible to create a list to port, 
      which it was not, because the port tank was full and the starboard one empty;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - thereafter he 
      established that the starboard list had already increased by 1 degree and 
      from that moment increased rapidly;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- at a list of 
      30°-35° the 2 port main engines stopped; an attempt to restart the engines 
      failed;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> -<b><i> "We continued 
      to make 5-6 knots."</i></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - a moment later 
      the 4th engine followed by the 3rd engine also stopped; the auxiliaries 
      continued to produce power;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - ca. 01.30 hours 
      the list was 45° and also the auxiliaries stopped and the emergency generator 
      on deck 8 started;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the bridge asked 
      whether it would be possible to pump freshwater overboard, which it was 
      not as there was no more power for the pumps;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - left the ECR 
      and reached the 8th deck via emergency exit when the list was practically 
      90°.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    statement was most probably made before anyone from ESCO or the JAIC had spoken 
    to him and can thus be considered uninfluenced. It is the only of the official 
    statements in which he testifies to have felt the two double, hard bangs at 
    about 01.00 hours. At 01.15 hours he certainly saw water entering the car 
    deck via the ramp, but he does not say whether he looked at the monitor straight 
    after the bangs. Actually water had already penetrated the ramp before 01.00 
    hours. If he saw it for the first time, his timing must be wrong by 13-15 
    minutes, unless he did not look at the monitor before because he was busy 
    with other matters, e.g. the starboard stabiliser. This is also confirmed 
    by his statement that the list at 01.30 hours was 45°, which it actually was 
    already at ca. 01.15 hours, whilst at 01.30 hours the vessel was on the side 
    or was almost on the side, as confirmed by many survivors, e.g. trainee mate 
    Einar Kukk who looked at his watch. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b>This 
    is not possible. It is more likely that the drencher system became activated

    the ramp was there and visible, but at the sides and underneath water was 
    pressing through as if there were no sealings. This implies that the ramp 
    was open to some extent and it remained open since then, because when Treu

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Watch Estonian 
      time 24.00-04.00. Speed after 2400 was about 14.7-15 knots. Shortly after 
      the accident the speed was reduced. Port ME before the accident was running 
      at 560 rmp's. After the accident it was running at 500 rpm's and the speed 
      was 10-11 knots. Treu did not note any vibrations, indicating that the vessel 
      was turning after the accident. According to the ETA-Pilot the normal speed 
      of the vessel was 580-600 rpm's. <b>Linde was seen on the monitor at 01.00, 
      coming from the pumping station for the visor and ramp</b>. The bridge ordered 
      us to pump ballast when the ship had heeled. When the ME's and Aux's stopped 
      the bridge asked if we could pump out freshwater. 01.20 or 01.21 "Mr. Skylight". 
      01.20-01.25 ME's stopped due to heel. First Port, then Stb'd ME's stopped 
      due to low oil pressure. Treu left the ECR at 01.30-01.32 when the Aux's 
      had stopped. On (=when looking at) the monitor the ramp seemed to be in 
      its correct position when water entered the car deck around the (ramp) edges. 
      The 4th Engineer had the watch 20.00-24.00 on the Estonian coast. He may 
      have information on the vessel's speed. The ship started heeling when water 
      entered the car deck. When Treu left the ECR the list was 70°-75°. Treu 
      did not observe any heel of the vessel first to one and then to the other 
      side, for instance first to Stb'd and then P and finally back to Stb'd. 
      The ship was thus according to Treu heeling to Stb'd at all times. The 3rd 
      Engineer always had the 00.00-04.00 watch. The propeller pitch could be 
      seen from the ECR. Treu did not observe any change in pitch. When the ship's 
      stern sank the vessel came towards Treu. Treu was in the water on the Stb'd 
      side by the funnel. When he got into a lifeboat the ship's stern was already 
      deep down. The ship was upright (same Finnish word for upright = stern down 
      / stern up, as for upright = no heel, Peter's note). The lights went out 
      at 01.30. The emergency generator functioned at greater angles of heel than 
      the Aux's. The lube oil level in the engines was higher than normal. The 
      emergency generator stopped when the heel was great, almost 90°. When the 
      emergency generator stopped the accumulator batteries took over. There was 
      light until the vessel sank. Treu did not see Linde except on the monitor, 
      but overheard his report to the bridge. Treu is positive that Linde reported 
      to the bridge. Treu cannot estimate when the vessel sank, maybe at 01.45-02.00. 
      Linde reported water on the car deck at 01.15. He did not say how much or 
      how the water was entering the car deck. Treu kept the camera fixed on the 
      bow ramp. There were no observations of water on the lower passenger deck. 
      When the camera showed the bow ramp the same picture was also displayed 
      on the bridge monitor on the Stb'd side of the chart room. Water entered 
      the car deck along the sides of the ramp under great pressure. Water flew 
      all the way on to the video camera lens. Treu did not observe water leaking 
      along the upper edge of the ramp. Partly the upper part of the ramp was 
      visible on the monitor. Treu was not able to say whether he could have observed 
      water entering along the upper edge. The stabilising fins were deployed 
      at 00.30.«</i></font></p>

      water was penetrating between ramp and hull at such high pressure that the 
      camera was hit. I realised that the vessel rolled 3° to starboard and 1.5° 
      to port and the next time much more to starboard and upright and then a 
      very heavy heel to starboard.<b> Then I heard Silver Linde's voice on the

      to restart them, but in vain. This was at about the time of the first "Mr.

      I informed the bridge that I was also going up now to check the emergency 
      generator, which stopped after a short while when the vessel was on the

  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Olle Noord:</b>

  <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Margus Treu:</b>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above indicates 
    that Treu, who is probably the only one to know exactly what happened, does 
    not believe that the stabilisers were out, at least not during the final stage 
    when the speed had dropped below 4 knots. It is the only indication in one 
    of the official documents that there might have been something wrong with 
    the stabilisers, because N&T/ ESCO and the crew remain silent on this, which 
    indicates that there might be some connection with the casualty.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the book 
    by Andi Meister, the Chairman of the JAIC until July 1996, it is stated in 
    Chapter 7 on page 134: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»At about 00.35 
    hours the watch engineer went into the engine room in order to get the stabilisers 
    in operation. At 00.30 hours the watch officer on the bridge activated the 
    stabilisers in accordance with the master's instructions, however, one fin 
    did not follow (did not move out).«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is not stated 
    what was done to rectify the problem, but Margus Treu told the English journalist 
    Phillip Wearne in May 1998 that there had been a "stabiliser alarm" at about 
    00.30 hours, when the bridge tried to activate the stabilisers. It concerned 
    the starboard fin which did not move out and it took him and Sillaste ca. 
    5 minutes to activate this fin.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Andi Meister 
    told Phillip Wearne subsequently that Henrik Sillaste did not confirm the 
    above and has refused to talk about it. Sillaste told the journalist, however, 
    that there had been major problems with the starboard stabiliser during the 
    installation when the vessel had been in drydock at Naantali the last time, 
    among other things; there had been a fire. The damage caused had to be repaired 
    during the already very short time available and the vessel sailed as planned, 
    however, without everything in way of the starboard stabiliser installation 
    being carried out in accordance with good workmanship as it should have been.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In this connection 
    two remarks have to be made:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1.) At the time 
    of the casualty DIANA II was in the process of being taken over by N&T/ESCO 
    in Rostock. Some Estonian crew members were already on board, also Captain 
    Erik Moik as well as the representative of the Turku Repair Yard responsible 
    for the installation of the stabilisers on the ESTONIA. This man had become 
    very stressed upon hearing about the ESTONIA casualty, but then became very 
    relaxed when it was reported that the visor had broken off.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 2.) One of the divers 
    spoke to a member of SEA and indicated that it is known why the casualty really 
    happened, viz. something relevant had been only "spot welded" instead of fully 
    welded and the element could thus not withstand the forces acting on it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During the analysis 
    of the statements of the survivors from deck 1 the possibility that the starboard 
    stabiliser fin broke off and tore open the empty starboard heeling tank and/or 
    the auxiliary engine room compartment will have to be borne in mind, in particular 
    since recent reports from Tallinn state that there had been a lot of water 
    in the engine room which they had been unable to pump out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary:</font></p>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Treu was in the 
    ECR from the beginning of the casualty sequence-of-events up to the end; possibly 
    only interrupted by the time when he was working on the starboard stabiliser. 
    During the time when he was in the ECR he had two clocks in his immediate 
    vicinity in addition to his own wristwatch. Consequently, it has to be assumed 
    that at least his first time statements were relatively exact, whilst the 
    other times, e.g. when the vessel was on her side, were purely guessed. Later 
    he knew from the other survivors that this had been at about 01.30 hours and 
    said it was so when he was interviewed by Jutta Rabe. Therefore in his first 
    statement he stated the time for the two impacts to have been ca. 01.00 hours, 
    which is confirmed by many others, but later moved it back by some 15 minutes, 
    obviously under the influence of his superiors. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He has, however, 
    repeatedly stated that after having felt those two unusual impacts he immediately 
    went to the monitor and saw water streaming in respectively being pressed 
    through at the sides of the bow ramp, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly but not 
    fully open, because if the bow ramp had been pulled open by the visor broken-off 
    he could not have seen the bow ramp and certainly would not have stated that 
    water was streaming in at the sides. This does not exclude that water had 
    been streaming on to the car deck for some time already because he was not 
    looking to the monitor all the time, probably this was the first time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Consequently the 
    following might be concluded:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu heard 
        and felt the impacts, which were not caused by waves, at around 01.00 
        hours;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he went straight 
        to the monitor and saw water penetrating the bow ramp at both sides under 
        pressure, i.e. the bow ramp was slightly open because at that time the 
        ramp actuators had already been torn off the ramp and the ramp was being 
        held by the mooring line - see Chapter 19.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- simultaneously 
        or shortly thereafter Silver Linde reported the water ingress to the bridge, 
        i.e. he must have been on the car deck further aft - probably in the door 
        of the centre casing - where the camera did not pick him up and where 
        he saw the water ingress directly. This would mean that it was well before 
        01.00 hours, because the abrupt heel occurred at 01.02 hours and how else 
        could Linde be in the crew accommodation on 7th deck at ca. 01.05 hours?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Treu in his 
        statements 2 and 3 has probably deliberately moved the times backwards 
        by some 10 to 15 minutes; this becomes most obvious when he states - in 
        his interview to Jutta Rabe of March 1995 - that the auxiliaries only 
        stopped when the list was about 45° and that then it was 01.30 hours when 
        the vessel was actually on her starboard side and that he, himself, was 
        already on deck. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The authors 
        of the book 'Katastrofen Kurs', Anders Jörle and Anders Hellberg, who 
        had early access to the initially confidential protocols and working papers 
        of the Swedish part of the JAIC, have revealed that also JAIC had formed 
        the opinion that Treu's timing was impossible. The authors explain this 
        with <i>"Treu's loyalty to Estline which apparently increased all the 
        more as time went on" </i>(last paragraph on page 157). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The authors continue

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»His time 
        scheme becomes totally impossible when as during the detailed questioning 
        at Landvetter he reconfirms: "... the last time I looked at the clock 
        was at 00.30 hours (note: Swedish time) and then the auxiliaries had just 
        stopped."<br>
        This, however, is not possible, because Andres Tammes had told the SILJA 
        EUROPA in the course of the distress communi-cation already at 01.25 hours 
        that they had a blackout and therefore could not state their position. 
        But there cannot be a 'blackout' as long as the auxiliaries are running. 
        Even the Estonian Commission admitted that "there has to be something 
        wrong with Treu's statements as to the times, apparently in connection 
        with the alarm clock (in the engine room) ... there is a mistake of between 
        5 and 8 minutes ...".«</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The psychologist 
      Bengt Schager, expert to the Swedish part of the JAIC, also stated:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Margus Treu's 
        exactness in question of times is questionable ... Margus Treu is about 
        10 minutes too late in his time statements.«</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - In the opinion 
      of this 'Group of Experts' his timing at least 15 minutes late, and his 
      loyalty towards Estline is also demonstrated by the obvious fact that in 
      none of his statements does he say anything about his observation why the 
      bow ramp was slightly open thus enabling water to penetrate the gaps at 
      both sides from the full visor on to the car deck, viz. just what he told 
      Hannes Kadak after Kadak entered the ECR following the abrupt heeling to 
      starboard: <i>"Tillständet är allvarligt" eller "dälig", "efterson rampen 
      har slagit sönder." </i>This translated means: <i>"The situation is dangerous/serious, 
      because the ramp has been struck and become broken."</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - It is amazing 
      that the JAIC has ignored this important observation which, fortunately, 
      Kadak testified in his first, obviously uninfluenced, statement. Instead 
      the JAIC has endeavoured, successfully, to weaken Kadak's precise statement 
      (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.5.284.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      21.2.5.284</a>) that he saw water penetrating the bow ramp at the starboard 
      upper side already at 00.46 hours, which is most likely the truth bearing 
      in mind the full visor and the conditions of the bow ramp (see statement 
      2nd engineer Peeter Tüür dated 03.10.94 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/12.5.183.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      12.5.183</a> - and see also Chapter 16).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The most probable 
      explanation for Treu's observation that the bow ramp was struck and became 
      broken can be found in Chapter 32.</font></p>

    As the distance between the bow ramp and the centre casing is 27 m this is 
    technically not possible and the water smashing against the camera lens must 
    have come from somewhere else, the drencher system. It has to be assumed that 
    the drencher system on the car deck as well as the fire alarm were activated 
    and the nozzles fitted under deck also between the bow ramp and the centre 
    casing were spraying water under pressure also on the camera lens. As this
