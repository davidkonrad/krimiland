<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The German 'Group 
      of Experts' was set up to find out the causes of the accident.<br>
      The chairman of the German 'Group of Experts', Dr. Peter Holtappels, accepted 
      the appointment only under the condition that the Group could act independently, 
      i.e. without any interference by the management of Jos. L. Meyer GmbH. This 
      total independence was granted and strictly adhered to. </font></p>

  <div align="left">
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The main work was 
      done by Dr. Peter Holtappels, Captain Werner Hummel and Dipl. Ing. Tomas

      and, to a certain extent, at the Meyer Werft, Papenburg.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The other 
      experts came in and went out as the situation required. Numerous trips to 
      Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom were made and from time to time Estonia 
      and/or Latvia have been visited.<br>
      A considerable amount of time was spent on the evaluation of the investigation 
      results of the visor, the ROV and diver videos and the recovered objects. 
      Also the evaluation of the numerous statements of the 137 official survivors, 
      the collection of evidence from previous passengers, the review of the files 
      of the Swedish and Finnish parts of the JAIC as well as from the Public 
      Prosecutor in Stockholm and the subsequent follow up took quite some time.
