<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel was delivered 
    to Rederiaktiebolaget Sally on 29 June 1980 under the name VIKING SALLY and 
    placed in daily operation between Turku and Mariehamn in Finland, and Stockholm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Rederiaktiebolaget 
    Sally, based in Mariehamn, was at that time one of the major Finnish shipping 
    companies with engagement in tankers and passenger vessels. The company was 
    one of three which together formed the marketing consortium 'Viking Line' 
    for ferry operations between Finland and Sweden (see Subchapter 2.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In 1986, ownership 
    of the vessel was taken over by the Finnish/Swedish group Effjohn, owners 
    of the competing Silja Line. The vessel continued, however, to operate in 
    the Viking fleet under the original name. The technical operation was subcontracted 
    with the remaining part of the Sally company.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In April 1990 the 
    Effjohn group took over full operation of the vessel and transferred her to 
    Silja Line under the name SILJA STAR for continued operation between Turku 
    and Stockholm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In January 1991 
    the vessel was transferred to the Wasa Line, another subsidiary of the Effjohn 
    group, and was placed in the Wasa Line operation in the Gulf of Bothnia between 
    Vaasa in Finland and Umeå and Sundsvall in Sweden. The ship was then renamed 
    WASA KING. She operated on this route until she was sold to the Estline Marine 
    Company Limited, which is registered in Cyprus.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The 
    ship was under Finnish supervision and flew the Finnish flag from delivery 
    until 14 January 1993. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This schedule was 
    only interrupted by stays at the yard, maximum once a year, and during winter 
    time when the vessel stayed one Monday at Turku and the following Monday at 
    Stockholm. These were the only times for maintenance work to be carried out 
    in port, otherwise workers of the Sally owned shipyard in Mariehamn travelled 
    with the vessel and carried out the necessary repairs at sea. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The vessel had two 
    experienced crews consisting mainly of Ålanders having spent their working 
    life on board of car/passenger ferries in the Baltic. The crews relieved each 
    other every 14 days. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The route of VIKING 
    SALLY led through the archipelagos off the Finnish west coast via the Åland 
    Islands crossing 28 nm of open sea to Stockholm, i.e. the vessel was never 
    more than 14 nm from the nearest land.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The two masters 
    basically employed on VIKING SALLY during the time before she was sold were 
    Lars Mäkki (still with Viking Line) and Håkan Karlsson - member of this 'Group 
    of Experts' until his death in March 1997 - whilst Stig Lindström was her 
    chief officer for many years (who passed away in January 1996). Lars Karlsson, 
    the co-ordinator of the owners' newbuilding supervision team at Papenburg, 
    was her first chief engineer and stayed on board in that capacity until 30.03.92, 
    i.e. 91/2 months before she was sold to Estline Marine Company Limited.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The technical superintendent 
    from the time of newbuilding until 1988 was Yngve Röblom, thereafter it was 
    his colleague Lars Janlöv until SILJA STAR became WASA KING, at which time 
    Charles Richardson became responsible for technical matters until she was 
    handed over to Estline Marine Company Limited in mid January 1993. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    statements of these three technical superintendents they never had any problems 
    with the vessel. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the 
    course of this investigation a number of people who had spent a great deal 
    of time on board of or with the vessel have been interviewed by this 'Group 
    of Experts', among others:</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The information obtained 
    on the operation of the vessel is summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also at sea the 
      vessel was run all the time on a very tight schedule, i.e. with all 4 main 
      engines constantly at 90% output, unless weather conditions commanded reduction.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the engine 
      control room (ECR) there were two output regulators for the main engines 
      which were normally set at 90%. The output of the propulsion plant could 
      be changed from the ECR. The propulsion plant could be run on "Combinator" 
      or on "Constant Revolutions". Except during yard trials in 1980 the "Combinator" 
      mode was always used. Up to 70% output pitch and revolutions were increasing 
      simultaneously until the maximum revolutions were reached. Thereafter the 
      output could be further increased by increasing the pitch while the revolutions 
      remained unchanged. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has to be 
      remembered that VIKING SALLY was originally built for traffic within the 
      archipelago. When trading in the open Baltic in heavy seas a tendency of 
      the visor to move sideways was observed which was created by the recess 
      in the shell plating aft of the visor and caused the bow to set-in very 
      heavily. When the vessel was, however, proceeding against head seas the 
      pressure on the visor was in the aft direction. (Force direction is aft.)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reduction of 
      speed in heavy head seas is not only a question of reduction of stress on 
      vessel's and visor's structure and fixing points, but also the comfort of 
      passengers has to be taken into account. Lars Karlsson made at least 1000 
      cruises and more than 100 times reduced the engine output himself in the 
      engine room when he considered it necessary in heavy weather. He did so 
      for the last times in July 1991 when the vessel was already sailing as WASA 
      KING between Vaasa and Umeå/Sundsvall and consequently the vessel arrived 
      once 11/2 hours late and another time 21/2 hours late.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When the vessel 
      was sailing between Turku and Stockholm there had to be two officers and 
      one AB on the bridge. When she was shifted to the Vaasa/Umeå trade the owners 
      wanted to spare one officer, which was accepted by F.B.N. under the condition 
      that the control panel for the indicator lights for visor and bow ramp were 
      moved to the large operation panel in front of the bridge where the lights 
      could be seen from the seats of master and watch-officer. This was done 
      some time in 1991.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the car deck 
      4 cameras were installed prior to delivery in 1980, i.e. one forward towards 
      the forward ramp, two at the sides and one looking aft towards the stern 
      ramp. The cameras could be moved and also had zoom ability. Monitors were 
      on the bridge (located at port side of the entrance to the chart room) and 
      in the ECR above the instrument panel. The camera picture shown on the monitor 
      could be changed to any other camera, either manually or automatically. 
      The monitors on bridge and in ECR were showing the same picture. The main 
      monitor with operating sticks was in the ECR, i.e. the bridge could not 
      change to another camera nor operate the zoom. Later a further camera was 
      installed at port side of the car deck, but it is unknown where and by whom 
      the pictures were recorded.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Officers and engineers 
      had their accommodation directly in front of the superstructure overlooking 
      the forecastle deck including the visor.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The forepeak was 
      more or less always full in order to keep the vessel on even keel. By means 
      of tank No. 1 the trim of the vessel was adjusted depending on the number 
      of trucks. The trim was mostly 0.5 - 1 m by the stern. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After closing 
      of ramps and visor the hydraulic pumps were always switched off, whereafter 
      a rest pressure remained between cylinders and control lever which slowly 
      decreased within the following 3-4 hours. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Visor and ramps 
      were exclusively operated by the chief officer and the boatswain.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Sea watches were 
      maintained at sea and in port.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Safety rounds 
      were made every 30 minutes on the car deck and below.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inside of 
      the visor was only accessible via the entrance hatch on the forecastle part 
      of the visor. There were no lamps installed inside the visor. </font></li>
