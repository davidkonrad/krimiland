  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Due to the 
    wind and current conditions prevailing after the sinking, the floating objects 
    from the ESTONIA drifted southeast to south-southeast according to the Annexes 
    6/4 and 6/5 of Supplement No. 402 of the Final Report of the JAIC and stranded 
    on the north Estonian islands or on the coast of the mainland.</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 29 and 30 September 
    1994 in total 433 immersion suits, 289 lifevests and 8 containers full of 
    lifevests were found along the coast of the Island of Hiumaa. All but one 
    of the 10 lifeboats of the ESTONIA got away from the vessel. Life-boat no. 
    2, i.e. the first one on port side, was still attached to its davits during 
    the ROV and diving investigations. Eight of the remaining 9 lifeboats were 
    found drifting upside down or water filled and they stranded subsequently 
    either on the Estonian mainland beaches or on the Island Hiumaa (Dagö). Lifeboat 
    no. 1 - a motor launch specifically equipped for emergency actions, e.g. man 
    overboard manoeuvres and thus called on board the "MOB rescue boat" - was 
    found near Hangö according to the JAIC report page 130, subchapter 8.10. Upon 
    request for details about the position and condition of the boat the National 
    Bureau of Investigation - Criminal Technological Laboratory - advised however 
    that life-boat No. 1 had actually been picked up on 29 September 1994 at 14.30 
    hours by the M.V. "HYLJE" (F.B.N. vessel) in position 59°16'40"N; 22°52'12''E 
    and subsequently brought to Hangö - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/23.1.391.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    23.1.391.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This position 
    is only 8.5 nm to the south-east of the wreck position and not very likely 
    because the lifeboat had to break loose from its davits before the vessel 
    had settled down on her starboard side at the sea bottom as it otherwise would 
    have been burried in the sea bottom below the vessel. This means that the 
    lifeboat had to break loose from the davits and start drifting on 28.09.94 
    at about 02.00 hours. At 14.30 hours on 29.09.94 when it was allegedly found, 
    it had been drifting for 36.5 hours already but covered a distance of 8.5 
    nm only.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other 
    hand according to Supplement 402 to the JAIC Report Annexes 5/5 and 6/4 the 
    lifeboats had drifted already 27.68 nm to the south-east within the first 
    24 hours, while the total distance to the Island Hiumaa (Dagö) is only 33 
    nm. Therefore the alleged as-found position for lifeboat No. 1 is unrealistic. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Lifeboat No. 
    9 - the last one on the starboard side - was found on the Estonian coast. 
    When it was inspected a camera with two films, belonging to the Swedish press 
    photographer Håkan Isefjord, was found jammed inside the boat. Håkan Isefjord 
    was a passenger but did not survive. The finding of the camera with the two 
    films was reported only days later to the Swedish Embassy in Tallinn from 
    where the information was passed immediately to the criminal police in Stockholm 
    - See Enclosure 21.1.392. Instructions on how to treat the films were passed 
    to Tallinn and the then acting prosecutor Birgitta Cronier ordered camera 
    and films to be brought to Stockholm soonest. When the objects arrived in 
    Stockholm, however, there were said to be no films. All this is revealed from 
    the files of the finally acting prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The buoys floated 
    off the sinking ferry and were found on 2 October 1994 along the Estonian 
    coast near Dirhami in switched-off condition. This was reported by fax by 
    Uno Laur, a member of the Estonian part of the JAIC, on 29.12.94 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/23.1.391.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure
