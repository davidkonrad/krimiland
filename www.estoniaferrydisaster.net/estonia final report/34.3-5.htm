  Systematical Fracture Tests with Atlantic Lock Mock-ups of<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">As it had 
    been established by the before explained analysis of the visor structure that 
    the Atlantic lock was exposed to less load than the side locks as long as 
    the hinges were intact and that the force direction would be aft, it was suggested 
    to the technical group of the JAIC - Börje Stenström - Tuomo Karppinen - Klaus 
    Rahka - to have mock-ups built and tested to destruction by an institute of 
    their choice, also by the Finnish VTT where both Karppinen and Rahka were 
    employed. This was, however, not possible as this institute did not have sufficient 
    pulling power, agreement was reached to have the break- tests carried out 
    by the Institute of Naval Architecture (Institut für Schiffbau) in Hamburg 
    and four mock-ups were built according to the suggestions of Stenström/Rahka 
    which were identical with exception of the welding seams between the bushing 
    starboard lug and the housing/centre- and port-lugs.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These 
    were: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) welding seam 
      thickness 3 mm (as found on the lug remains recovered from the wreck);<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) bushing 
      and housing only spot-welded to the lugs;<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) no welding 
      seams at all;<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) welding 
      seams 3 mm but visor lug strengthened above dimensions according to drawings.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The tests were carried 
    out in the presence of members of the technical group of the JAIC as well 
    as B.V., the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg and this 'Group of Experts'.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lugs were 
    made of normal steel and the bolt, bushing and housing of high tensile steel. 
    The results were as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Test (1) :</b> 
    The big visor lug broke at a load of 204.3 ts. The bolt was slightly deformed, 
    the lugs and welding seams remained unaffected.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Test (2) :</b> 
    The starboard and centre lugs broke at a load of 142.5 ts., the port lug was 
    deformed towards port but did not break the visor lug and the bolt remained 
    unaffected. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Test (3) :</b> 
    The starboard and the centre lugs broke at a load of 99.2 ts., the port lug 
    in its forward part was slightly deformed towards port but did not break, 
    the visor lug and the bolt remained unaffected. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Test (4) : </b>The 
    starboard and the centre lugs broke at a load of 204 ts., the port lug did 
    not break at the test because the pulling was discontinued after the breakage 
    of the starboard and centre lugs; it has to be assumed, however, that it would 
    have broken if the pulling had been continued as it had been in practice. 
    The bolt was slightly deformed, the visor lug apparently remained unaffected.

    34.3.431</a>. These tests were performed upon recommendation and in the presence

    34.3.431</a> - was sent to them soon after the tests in 1996. Although the 
    report clearly states that the lugs were made of <b>normal (mild) steel </b>and 
    that the bottom lock assembly broke at<b> 2.04 MN </b>load the JAIC has stated

      the bottom lock assembly made of high-tensile strength steel. In these tests, 
      characterised by different extent of welding between the attachment lugs 
      and the locking bolt housing, failures occurred between 1.0 and 2.0 MN. 
      A test that incorporated intermittent welds resulted in failure at 1.42 
      MN.«</font></i></p>

    Bow Impact of Ro-Ro Vessels by Det Norske Veritas</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This paper - given 
    to the Society of Naval Architects of Japan by Det norske Veritas (DnV) - 
    concentrates on design load aspects for the bow area and presents results 
    of recent work carried out by DnV with the aim of evaluating the long term 
    bow impact loads that a Ro-Ro vessel may be subjected to during its operational 
    life. The reason why it has been incorporated into this report is the obvious 
    fact that the results are partly absolutely contrary to the findings of the 
    JAIC. The paper is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.5.433.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.5.433</a> and the conclusions are as follows: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Bow impact 
      of five different Ro-Ro vessels is studied numerically and empirically. 
      Impact is considered both from an ultimate and a fatigue point of view. 
      For the ultimate load case, the loads are found to be strongly a function 
      of the wave height and the forward vessel speed. this illustrates the importance 
      of speed reductions in rough seas. The study also shows that the highest 
      waves do not necessarily induce the highest impact loads on the structure. 
      The bow impact loads from the DnV Classification Rules are intended to cover 
      all types of designs and design conditions.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">A 
      fatigue investigation of the bow door support system for one typical vessel 
      has been carried out. A long term distribution of the bow forces has been 
      established based upon a gradual speed reduction when wave height exceeds 
      significant wave height = 5 meter. The results of the analysis show a fatigue 
      life exceeding 66 years when using the North Atlantic wave climate as basis 
      and <b>constant operation in head seas</b>. This corresponds to 400 years 
      fatigue life for operation in all headings and on this basis it is concluded 
      that fatigue does not represent a problem provided the vessel is operated 
      with good seamanship. These conclusions are based upon the assumption that 
      the bow doors are designed for ultimate loads according to the DnV 1994 
      Rules and that NV36 strength steel or lower is applied. The welded details 
      are according to normal ship practice and with an intact corrosion protection.«
