  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">On 27 September 
    1994 the responsible government organisation in Estonia, the Estonian Meteorological 
    and Hydrological Institute (EMHI), issued several weather prognoses and forecasts 
    for the Baltic Sea and for the Port of Tallinn. These were valid for 12, 24 
    and 48 hours and were broadcasted by the ESCO radio centre at 06.00 hours, 
    12.00 hours and 21.00 hours (all times UTC = Estonian time minus 2 hours) 
    and also sent by telex to the Port of Tallinn authority which took care of 
    the distribution to the vessels in port.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Additional 
    prognoses were sent twice a day via the NAVTEX system. Storm warnings were 
    issued according to necessity and distributed via the above explained channels. 
    A prognosis included the wind speed in m/sec, the wind direction, visibility, 
    precipitation, wave height and air temperature.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ESTONIA 
    was equipped with a NAVTEX receiver, thus received the prognosis and the storm 
    warning through this system in addition to what was directly received from 
    the Port of Tallinn. Reportedly Stockholm Radio transmitted 2 weather forecasts 
    from MET CENTER Tallinn (EMHI) on 27 September 1994 which were apparently 
    also sent by telex from EMHI to the Port of Tallinn directly, viz.:</font></p>

    for "ESTONIA"</b><br>
    In addition to the above stated information received from the Estonian side, 
    the ESTONIA was a subscriber of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological 
    Institute (SMHI) and received daily by fax a so-called "special prognosis". 
    This had also been the case on the afternoon of the 27 September 1994 when 
    the SMHI sent, by fax at 13.11 Swedish time = 14.11 Estonian time, this "special 
    prognosis", the receipt of which was reportedly confirmed by the ESTONIA. 
    In this special forecast ESTONIA's command was advised that they had to expect 
    on the leg between north of the island Osmussaar and south of Bogskär, i.e. 
    between ca. 21.00-03.00 hours: <i>»SW-W winds of 15-20 m/s with significant 
    wave heights of 2.5 - 3.5 m and max. wave heights of 5.5 m«.<br>

    documentation is attached in one bundle as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/18.235.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    18.235</a> together with office translations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of the 
    above it has to be concluded that the command of the ESTONIA, at the latest 
    upon receipt of the "Special Prognosis" from the SMHI at 14.11 Estonian time, 
    should have been aware that storm force winds from SW-westerly direction with 
    wind speeds of up to 25 m/s corresponding to Bft. 9-10 and wave heights of 
    up to 5.5 m would be met in the open sea. This was about 3 hours before loading 
    commenced when the master was said to have been ashore and two groups of Estonian 
    "safety inspector trainees" led by two Swedish Sjöfartsverket inspectors were 
    inspecting the ferry accompanied by chief officer Juhan Herma and chief engineer 
    Lembit Leiger (see Chapter 15). The inspection ended only about 11/2 hours 
    before departure and had created considerable problems for the chief officer 
    and the chief engineer who were of course aware of the very severe deficiencies 
    of bow ramp and visor. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the evidence available no particular precautions were taken by the deck crew 
    on the car deck. While the engine room crew got instructions from the chief 
    engineer to make seafast all moveable things in the engine room as bad weather 
    was to be expected. (Interview motorman Elmar Siegel - July 1996 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.192.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.192</a>). <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    the forecasted wind speeds and wave heights would be no reason for concern 
    to those in command of a vessel like the ESTONIA, provided, that the vessel 
    was in a seaworthy condition and that her cargo was stowed and secured in 
    accordance with good seamanship. Both criteria, however, were not fulfilled 
    by ESTONIA. </font></p>
