  The New Role of Bureau Veritas and the<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The B.V. head 
    office for the Nordic countries was located in Copenhagen since 1990. The 
    head office for Sweden was in Gothenburg, the manager was Hans Olsson. Further, 
    there were B.V. offices in Trelleborg, Malmö and Stockholm whose senior and 
    staff surveyors reported to the Gothenburg office. Hans Olsson reported directly 
    to the head office in Paris.</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> Hans 
      Olsson left the B.V. organisation in August 1998. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There was 
      also a B.V. office in Helsinki which inspected the vessel in Finland as 
      long as she was flying the Finnish flag. The office was no more involved 
      after the flag and name change to ESTONIA.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    previous principal surveyor of the BV-Stockholm office, Lars Olof Ålander, 
    N&T had made it a condition for the ESTONIA to remain under classification 
    of B.V. that only one surveyor, namely his junior colleague, Anders Wirstam, 
    should carry out all the required surveys both in respect of class items and 
    the safety items to be inspected on behalf of the E.N.M.B. This was accepted 
    by B.V. and Anders Wirstam from the Stockholm office became the exclusive 
    surveyor for the ESTONIA in all respects. Upon instructions from the head 
    office in Paris he reported directly to the manager of the B.V. head office 
    for Sweden in Gothenburg, Hans Olsson, thereby bypassing the principal surveyor 
    Lars Olof Ålander - see also<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.44.2.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.4.3.44.2.</a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As mentioned 
    before, a contract was agreed also between B.V. and E.N.M.B. and signed already 
    on the 18.08.92 (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.2.114.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 6.2.114</a>), which provided that B.V. would act as agent for the 
    Estonian Administration for the purpose of surveying Estonian flag ships with 
    classification certificates issued by B.V. in order to determine the compliance 
    of such vessels with the mandatory requirements of certain International Conventions 
    referred to in Annex 1 - which includes SOLAS 1974. As the contract had already 
    been running since August 1992 it has to be assumed that B.V. had already 
    carried out some inspections of Estonian flag cargo vessels, but was uncertain 
    about the requirements in respect of car/passenger ferries like the ESTONIA. 
    Therefore B.V. sought the assistance of Shipinspec. The approach, however, 
    was not made by B.V. but by S.-C. Forsberg and Ulf Hobro from N&T, although 
    both Hans Olsson and Anders Wirstam are ex Shipinspec employees and Wirstam 
    had actually been working under the head of the Stockholm office of Shipinspec, 
    Ulf Beijner, who was now contacted by Forsberg/Hobro.</font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>Hans Olsson 
      - born in 1944 - studied marine engineering at Chalmers University, Gothenburg 
      from 1973-1977. Thereafter he joined Sjöfarts-verket and stayed for 13 years 
      until 1990 when he became head of BV-Sweden. Anders Wirstam - born 1942 
      - testified to having had 28 years of experience when being interrogated 
      in November 1994 and has been with Shipinspec Stockholm from 1966-1969 under 
      Ulf Beijner. </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Forsberg and Hobro 
    contacted Ulf Beijner, then still the head of Shipinspec's inspection office 
    Stockholm, on 24.11.92. According to a memo made by Ulf Beijner after the 
    meeting they outlined their plans to replace the NORD ESTONIA by the ESTONIA, 
    including the new companies structures, flag of vessel, Estonian crew and 
    time schedule. They also asked whether Shipinspec could assist B.V. in the 
    take-over procedure which was promised. The respective memo by Ulf Beijner 
    is attached - together with an office translation - as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.117.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.4.117. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Accordingly 
    N&T did not just request assistance for B.V. in general, but also requested 
    that Shipinspec should carry out the so-called "2/90 inspection" after the 
    take-over in Tallinn, which was also accepted. This "2/90 inspection" had 
    then already been replaced by official "Regulation 1/92" which came into force 
    on 15 April 1992 by order of the then head of Shipinspec, Safety Chief, Bengt-Erik 
    Stenmark. Regulation 1/92 together with an office translation is attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.118.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 6.4.118</a>. 
    It reveals that the main issue of this regulation is fire-fighting and lifeboat 
    drills respectively the training of crews and passengers in respect of the 
    above and it is quite obvious that this regulation had been drafted under 
    the influence of the SCANDINAVIAN STAR catastrophe. It further reveals that 
    the stated controls and exercises had and have to be carried out on all Swedish 
    flag vessels and all other vessels calling at Swedish ports. In addition, 
    it is required that passenger vessels regularly calling at Swedish ports have 
    to undergo a "1/92 inspection" with acceptable results before the vessel takes 
    up service. Whilst in service the vessel has to undergo continued inspections 
    in intervals determined by Shipinspec, however, at least once a year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Part of the Regulation 
    1/92 are the attachments 1 and 2, i.e. the "Report", and the "Guidance to 
    Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships". Both are attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.119.htm" target="_blank">Enclosures 6.4.119</a> 
    and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.4.120.htm" target="_blank">6.4.120</a>. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In particular 
    the "Guidance to Surveyors on Procedures for Operational Control of Ships", 
    which draws attention to the negative role the human element has played in 
    shipping disasters in the past, had been developed to avoid what did take 
    place only 20 months later on board of MV ESTONIA, a vessel which had been 
    "carefully" checked by inspectors of Shipinspec before taking up her trade 
    and which thereafter had called at Stockholm every second day. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event, 
    in addition to those "inspections" the vessel had to be visited frequently 
    by the Classification surveyor Anders Wirstam since ESTONIA participated in 
    the "Continuous Survey System" of B.V., i.e. 1500 items had to be checked 
    during 5 years, viz. 300 per year. For details see Subchapter 9.1.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Further on behalf 
    of E.N.M.B. the same B.V. surveyor had to</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - carry out the 
      Load Line Surveys<br>

      Ship Safety Certificate (annually), thereby confirming that the vessel met 
      SOLAS requirements.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Obviously quite 
    a substantial job for one man on a vessel like the ESTONIA. Further details 
    can be found in Subchapter 9.2. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After the companies' 
    structure had been established and the basic agreements were made quite some 
    activities developed between N&T and B.V. in connection with ESTONIA's documentation/certification, 
    and it became very obvious that N&T behaved and was treated as if they were 
    the owners. Nowhere in the relevant correspondence do E-Line, Estline or ESCO 
    appear.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the change 
    of flag and also because Estonia is signatory to the SOLAS Convention the 
    vessel had to comply with a number of amendments to SOLAS 1974, which she 
    apparently did not or, at least, B.V. and N&T were uncertain whether she did.

    in way of the accommodation and that subsequently an inclining experiment 
    was carried out by Ship Consulting Oy, Turku, because according to SOLAS -

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, since 
    1991 SOLAS requires in paragraph 3 of the same regulation: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»3 At periodical 
      intervals not exceeding five years, a lightweight survey shall be carried

      in comparison with the approved stability information, a deviation from 
      the lightship displacement exceeding 2% or a deviation of the longitudinal 
      centre of gravity exceeding 1% of L is found or anticipated.«</i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Based on the results 
    of the inclining experiment carried out in January 1991 Ship Consulting Oy 
    drew up a revised "Trim and Stability Booklet" dated 20.01.91, which was stamped 
    "Approved" by the F.B.N. on 23.01.91 and which is attached as Enclosure 3.4.86. 
    It is based on the initial one provided by Meyer Werft for the newbuilding 
    VIKING SALLY. Ship Consulting Oy, however, found that the centre of gravity 
    (CG) - in their opinion - was too far astern which had the following consequences:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the vessel 
      had a permanent stern trim which was compensated by filling up ballast tank 
      2; <br>
      (b) the A/Amax value was more than 95% if calculated on a stern trim of 
      0.40 m; if the calculation was made on even keel the Amax value was below 
      95%, but the margin line was submerged. <br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The "side casings" 
    on A-deck = car deck are the "side houses" which were not weathertight because 
    of the openings in both front bulkheads for the lugs and hooks of the hydraulic 
    and manual side locks of the visor. This was acceptable from the point of 
    view of the Load Line Convention because the "side casings" were considered 
    to be closed structures above the bulkhead deck. Also SOLAS 1974 - II-1, Rule 
    71 (margin line condition) excluded the theoretical flooding of the deck and 
    therefore such openings remained without closures in those years. Moreover, 
    as long as the visor remained weathertight no water could penetrate these 
    openings anyway, because they were located inside the rubber packings of the 
    visor at both front bulkheads. As soon as the visor started to "leak" and 
    became filled with water, these openings became a problem because they extended 
    from about 300 mm above the 3rd stringer level to the 2nd stringer level which 
    is within the area of watermarks visible inside the visor. Behind the openings 
    there was a void space located between A-deck and B-deck, which was accessible 
    only through an opening in B-deck with a sill of 200 mm height, but without 
    cover. It is unknown to this 'Group of Experts' whether the handwritten remark 
    "to be dealt with" on the fax dated 28.03.94, i.e. 6 months before the casualty,

    obvious fact that B.V. and N&T had some problems with the fulfilment of SOLAS 
    requirements concerning stability criteria which were not solved at the time 
    when the vessel sank. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary it can 
    be concluded that B.V. and N&T obviously still had serious problems after 
    the vessel had been in her new service for more than 1 year. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a meeting 
    with Capt. Hummel in July 1996 Veli Matti Junnila of Ship Consulting Oy, who 
    had made the calculations for the old Trim & Stability Manual dated 20.01.91 
    and who was working on the new one upon instructions of N&T at the time of 
    casualty, gave the following comments:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When rechecking 
    the intact and damage stability in the light of the new requirements B.V. 
    found out that the Centre of Gravity (CG) was too much astern. For this reason 
    she had always stern trim.<br>
    - To correct this and to reduce the swell in the archipelago, the duck tail 
    was fitted, which indeed allowed a reduced stern trim and increased the GM 
    because the waterline area was increased. Also the damage stability was improved 
    because the duck tail created more buoyancy in damaged condition.<br>
    - The problem, however, was the margin line which is a theoretical line 3 
    inches or 76 mm below bulkhead deck = car deck. This line must not be submerged 
    in the final stage of the flooding of two compartments - a requirement since 
    SOLAS 1965 - a condition which the ferry did fulfil only with stern trim.<br>

    <i>Stability Booklet</i> as well as the second one issued 20.01.91, did not 
    indicate the stern trim requirement and further, did not take into account 
    the duck tail, the built-in 85 tons of steel and, finally, also the stabilisers, 
    B.V. demanded a new <i>"Trim and Stability Booklet"</i> and declared the old 
    one "preliminary".<br>

    working on this booklet when the casualty occurred.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The Stability 
    Booklet of 20.01.91 is based on the actual inclining experiment of 11.01.91 
    when the duck tail was fitted and the 85 ts steel were built-in already. </font></p>
