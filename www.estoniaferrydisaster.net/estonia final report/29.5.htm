  The Shell Plating and Bottom Plating</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This particular area 
    of the wreck above the mudline was carefully examined by divers and ROV because 
    a surprisingly big part was accessible, much more than it could be assumed 
    with a vessel lying on her starboard side. The reason is, as demonstrated 
    by the drawings below taken from the Smit-Tak Report - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.410</a> - that the superstructure was buried into the sea bottom. Therefore 
    the wreck had a list of about 120° with the bottom up and a substantial part 
    of the starboard hull side was accessible above the bilge strake partly up 
    to car deck level.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This means that 
    over the whole length of the wreck the starboard shell plating in way of the 
    0-deck is accessible which includes the heeling tank and stabiliser pocket 
    areas. The same is true for the 1st deck which is accessible in most parts 
    while the car deck can only be reached in way of section D, which is aft of 
    the bridge. The drawing on the next page - also taken from the Smit-Tak Report 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.410</a> - indicates the section areas A-E.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg926.JPG" width="492" height="118"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Incidentally the 
    area at D - where the car deck is accessible - is most likely not the location 
    where the cement bags on pallets and other cargo were observed. See Subchapter 
    29.3.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also accessible 
    is the Starboard Shell Plating in way of 0-deck between Frames 85-120, i.e. 
    the area below the passenger accommodations on the 1st deck with exception 
    of the most forward compartment which is located on top of three initially 
    full freshwater tanks. Further aft there were the following watertight compartments 
    on 0-deck: </font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the evidence 
    of passengers from the cabins of the 1st, 3rd and 4th compartments, there 
    had been a lot of water on the 1st deck already before the big starboard heel 
    which escaped from 0-deck under pressure in way of the 4th compartment and 
    probably also came up the spiral stairway and the lift casing in the 3rd compartment. 
    - See the statement of Carl-Erik Reintamm attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.1.289.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.1.289</a>.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As the water 
    coming up from 0-deck to deck 1 had been under pressure - see the statement 
    of Carl Övberg - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.2.151.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.2.151</a> - there must have been a connection to the outside. As the 
    port side of the shell plating is apparently undamaged according to the ROV 
    inspections on 02.10.94 and 09.10.94 it has to be assumed that there must 
    be one or more holes in the starboard side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The 
    existence of such a hole in way of the sauna and swimming pool compartments 
    has been admitted by two Sjöfartsverket employees independently of each other. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since the starboard 
    shell plating in way of 0-deck is accessible over the whole length of the 
    wreck - see the 2 drawings on the previous pages - and has been carefully 
    examined by ROV and divers during the mudline surveys, it is certain that 
    respective video material is available. The "official" mudline video is, however, 
    censored, i.e. the relevant parts were deleted - see also the Disengage Report 
    - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.6.434.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.6.434.</a> Nevertheless, careful evaluation of the available mudline video 
    does reveal very substantial damage to the starboard shell plating and bottom 
    plating above and below the bilge keel as demonstrated by the images below.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg928.JPG" width="279" height="209"></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg929.JPG" width="394" height="587"></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg930.JPG" width="344" height="526"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When looking at the 
    images presented here it is difficult to assume that this vessel had been 
    in drydock only 8 months before, because the starboard side is really in a 
    very bad condition, actually much worse as it is possible to demonstrate by 
    images. Very deep indentations between the frames and deep scoring marks, 
    partly not even corroded, are the rule, however, in some particular areas 
    the plating is even holed as e.g. can be seen from the image below. </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg931b.JPG" width="276" height="214"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Enhancement by means 
    of special equipment confirmed indeed that the plating is holed - See the 
    enhancement below.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg932a.JPG" width="516" height="207"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the damage 
    appearance it has to be concluded that the plate was severely corroded, i.e. 
    the hole was neither caused by an impact of ex- or implosion but by corrosion. 
    This is easily possible if the coating and/or anode protection of a ballast 
    water tank, e.g. a heeling tank, was not in order. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following two 
    images show an area which is apparently also holed, but not by corrosion because 
    the edges are too sharp.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%203/pg932b.JPG" width="519" height="218"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In any event the 
    ferry ESTONIA departed from Tallinn on her last voyage with one or more starboard 
    ballast water tanks, possibly even the heeling tank, open to the sea. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As stated above 
    - see Chapter 17 - revised stability calculations showed that the vessel must 
    have had about 200 ts additional weight on the starboard side which could 
    not be pumped. The theoretical possibilities of unconfirmed flooding of compartments 
    through holes to the outside was discussed as the reader may remember. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The possibility 
    now turns to a fact. The vessel had holes in her underwater shell plating. 
    The obvious effect on the seaworthiness of the ferry needs not to be discussed. 
    The fact that the JAIC, having worked on the interpretation of those videos, 
    does not mention anything in this regard, is undebatable too. </font></p>
