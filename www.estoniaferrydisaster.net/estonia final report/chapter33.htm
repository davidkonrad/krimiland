  INCIDENTS OF RO-RO VESSELS </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Following the ESTONIA 
    catastrophe the governments of the countries involved - Estonia, Finland and 
    Sweden - initiated a number of investigations concerning</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) the national 
      organisations with responsibilities for own vessels according to national 
      law and international conventions; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) the national 
      organisations with responsibilities for foreign vessels under the Port-State-Control 
      (PSC) regime; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) the activities 
      of the international Classification Societies. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">First of all, however, 
    all car/passenger ferries with bow doors were closely inspected as soon as 
    possible whenever they arrived in a Swedish or Finnish ports. It is unknown 
    whether this procedure was also carried out in the Estonian ports. From Sweden 
    it is only known that reportedly 28 vessels were found to have serious defects 
    to their bow-door arrangements. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From Finland 
    the following report was received:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The bow and 
      stern doors of all the Finnish passenger/Ro-Ro cargo/ ferries have been 
      inspected by the maritime inspectors of the Finnish Board of Navigation 
      (F.B.N.).<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two 
      vessels were stopped for repairs. The locking arrangements have been welded 
      into closed position on board the ferries which run between Helsinki-Stockholm, 
      Helsinki-Travemünde and Vaasa-Sundsvall, and also on board the ferries which 
      are cruising in the Northern Baltic.<br>
      A special Port State Control Survey has been carried out on board all the 
      passenger ships which are regularly trading to the Finnish ports. Captain 
      Veikki Inkinen, Chief Maritime Inspector of the Gulf of Finland Maritime 
      District, informed that two main categories of damage to the locking devices 
      were found:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> 1. Fatigue 
      fractures. <br>
      2. Wear and tear.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Cracks and 
      fatigue fractures in the lugs of the locking devices and wear and tear failures 
      in the bolts. Some of the bolts were 78 mm undersize (max. acceptable 3 
      mm) due to extensive wear. Also corrosion damages were found.<br>
      The inspectors found damage to almost every ship's bow visor's locking devices.<br>
      Maritime Inspector Tom Sommerdal surveyed about 10 vessels in Helsinki. 
      Also he found wear and tear damages in the lugs and bolts of the locking 
      devices of the bow visors. Also leakages in the hydraulic systems were noted.<br>
      The vessels under Estonian flag were in worse condition than those under 
      Finnish flag.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the 
    Swedish government instructed already on the<b> 03.10.94</b> the previous 
    Supreme Court Judge <b>Magnus Sjöberg</b> to carry out an internal investigation 
    of the National Maritime Administration for Shipping and Navigation - Sjöfartsverket 
    - and, in particular, its Sjöfartsinspektionen - The Shipping Inspection (Shipinspec). 
    This investigation covered among other things the subjects 1) to 3) stated 
    on the previous page and was performed on basis of a Government decision defined 
    as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 28 September 
      1994, the passenger ferry Estonia foundered south-west of Utö in Finland 
      en route from Tallinn to Stockholm. The vessel was flying the Estonian flag. 
      On 29 September 1994, the Government commissioned the Board of Accident 
      Investigation to assist in the accident inquiry. A joint accident board 
      was then formed, with representatives from the Estonian, Finnish and Swedish 
      authorities. One of the main functions of this board is to establish the 
      reason for the accident.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Survivors 
      of this maritime disaster have stated that the vessel's bow "visor" was 
      torn away, which is supposed to have been an important cause of the sinking. 
      <br>
      Information has since emerged to the effect that incidents and problems 
      with bow doors have occurred previously with ferries of the same type as 
      the Estonia. A high standard of safety at sea demands that the necessary 
      conclusions are regularly drawn from incidents and accidents that occur. 
      In addition to the investigation now being carried out by the joint accident 
      board (JAIC), other matters should be dealt with including the reporting 
      routines within the Shipinspec. <br>
      The Government commissions former Judge of the Supreme Court Magnus Sjöberg 
      to carry out such a survey. As part of this, the investigator is to examine 
      how information relevant to maritime safety is analysed and promulgated 
      within the department, and where necessary put forward proposals for improvements. 
      The investigator is also to look at the options for and the frequency of 
      exchange of relevant maritime safety information between maritime safety 
      authorities and other bodies that have important functions in the field 
      of maritime safety, such as classification societies, insurers and shipowners' 
      associations. Finally, the investigator should examine how such information 
      exchange takes place between Shipinspec or corresponding bodies within our 
      local region, and where necessary put forward proposals as to how this might 
      be improved. <br>
      The investigator shall carry out his work in contact with the JAIC and in 
      co-operation with the special committee on increased maritime safety for 
      ferry services that the Government will be setting up.<br>
      The Government authorises the Minister of Communications to appoint a secretary 
      or other assistant to the investigator.<br>
      The work of the investigation shall be completed with the utmost dispatch.«</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete <i>"Report 
    on Maritime Safety Work by The Shipping Inspection"</i> by Magnus Sjöberg

    It comprises 58 pages and deals exclusively with the conditions existing before 
    and at the time of the ESTONIA accident and among other things the investigator 
    has closely looked into the history of bow door failures and associated incidents 
    as they were reflected in the various files of the different Sjöfartinspektionen 
    offices - not at a central register - of which some shall be explained below:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(a) The car/passenger 
    ferry "VISBY"<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry VISBY was built in 1972 and had a gross tonnage of 6665 registered tons. 
    On 12 November 1973 on its ordinary run between Nynäshamn and Visby, the forebody 
    of the ship was struck by heavy seas. The result was that the bow door opened 
    and water was shipped on the car deck. The master therefore decided to turn 
    the vessel back to Nynäshamn. This event took place after the vessel had come 
    out into the open sea. There was a high wind and heavy sea at the time. On 
    survey of the damage it was found that both of the locking hooks of the bow 
    door had been broken off and indentations were left on the door. As a temporary 
    measure the bow door and cargo ramp were welded to the hull. After the repair 
    had been water-tested and surveyed by the relevant Classification Society, 
    Lloyds Register of Shipping, the vessel received temporary permission to continue 
    trading until the next yard inspection. In February 1974 permanent repairs 
    were carried out, in which the bow door received new locking hooks of heavier 
    dimensions than previously, and the locking device was further reinforced 
    by shroud screws with lashing attachments.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec's 
    conclusion about the cause of the accident, as stated in the investigation 
    report dated 1 November 1974, was that the bow door locking devices were of 
    too weak construction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(b) "STENA SAILER" 
    <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Ro-Ro 
    cargo ship STENA SAILER was built in 1973 and had a gross registered tonnage 
    of 2872. On a voyage between Zeebrügge and Dover on 16 January 1974 with a 
    cargo of trailers and transport lorries, the vessel encountered heavy weather 
    with increasing opposing seas. The vessel reduced its speed, but the strong 
    sea broke apart the locking devices of the forward bow door, and lifted it 
    out of closed position. The space between the bow door and the bow ramp was 
    filled with water. The ramp was therefore secured using six chains. In order 
    to avoid additional damage, the vessel was hove to and subsequently Rotterdam 
    was called on as port of refuge where a temporary repairs were carried out. 
    The locking mechanism and hoisting arms of the bow door had been damaged, 
    and the port side ramp hydraulic actuators had become unusable after the failure 
    of the operating rod attachment. The investigation report of Shipinspec dated 
    12 December 1974 found that the cause of the accident was the took weak constructions 
    of the locking devices of ramp and bow door.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(c) "SVEA STAR"</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">SVEA STAR, 
    a car/passenger ferry built in 1968 with a gross registered tonnage of 9963, 
    was registered with Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Between Travemünde and Helsingborg 
    on 5 May 1974, the vessel encountered heavy weather and rising seas. A particularly 
    heavy sea struck the vessel, breaking the forward locking devices and extra 
    securings and lifting up the bow door. Water collected between the forward 
    door and the ramp. The vessel returned to Travemünde for damage inspection.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey 
    it was found that all three hydraulic locking devices were completely damaged, 
    and even the extra securing with two 2-inch turnbuckles had been torn apart. 
    No damage was evident to the actual door or ramp. The locking devices were 
    temporarily repaired and surveyed two days later in Helsingborg by both the 
    Classification Society and the Department.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Shipinspec 
    investigation report dated 12 December 1974 states that in the opinion of 
    the master, of the Classification Society and of the Department the accident 
    was due to the too weak construction of the locking devices of the bow door. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(d) "SAGA STAR" 
    </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry SAGA STAR, with a gross registered tonnage of 8226, was built in 1981. 
    On 6 May 1982 the vessel was about to sail from Travemünde to Helsingborg. 
    The weather was calm. When the bow visor was closed the port hinge failed 
    which caused the port side of the visor to fall down four meters. The hydraulic 
    hinges broke and oil leaked out. Immediately afterwards the starboard hinge 
    failed too and the entire visor fell down . After having been surveyed by 
    Lloyd's Register of Shipping, the vessel was given a permit to proceed to 
    Helsingborg - via Malmö - without its bow visor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon survey 
    damage to the visor and its attachments to the hull, and hull damage between 
    ramp and visor was ascertained. It was stated in the Shipinspec investigation 
    report that the accident was probably due to the visor hinges having been 
    of insufficient dimensions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(e) "STENA JUTLANDICA" 
    </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The car/passenger 
    ferry STENA JUTLANDICA was built in 1983, with a gross registered tonnage 
    of 15 811. On 12 October 1984, STENA JUTLANDICA was berthed at Fredrikshamn. 
    When the bow door was opened, the port hinge of the bow door failed and the 
    bow door fell down a bout 2 metres. After having been lifted back into position, 
    the door was welded in place. A permanent repair was carried out on a later 
    occasion. When the bow door was inspected, cracks were found in the hinge 
    attachment welds. The attachment plate was also partly cracked. According 
    to the Shipinspec investigation report the cause for the hinge failure was 
    the under-dimensioned welding seams of the hinge attachments which led to 
    crack propagation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(f) Certain other 
    accidents to ro-ro vessels <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The accident 
    on 16 March 1987 involving the HARALD OF FREE ENTERPRISE led the Shipinspec 
    immediately to carry out a review of all Swedish flag ferries from the stability 
    point of view. Letters were also written to the owners with questions about 
    such matters as their routines for operation and checking of bow and stern 
    doors.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">During this 
    investigation details were also obtained of previous bow door damage to Finnish 
    car/passenger ferries. For example, it was stated that the Finnish vessel 
    FINLANDIA sustained damage to her bow door in 1981 which also led to a modification 
    of her sister ship SILVIA REGINA, later STENA SAGA. It was also revealed that 
    the Finnish car-passenger ferry MARIELLA suffered very severe visor damage 
    in 1986 - see also further in this chapter - which led to structural changes 
    of her and the visor of her sister ship OLYMPIA, then still under construction. 
    During the investigation of the above events it turned out that the bows were 
    designed with too much flare, which had resulted in extreme bow stresses. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a result of the 
    disaster involving the ESTONIA, one of the actions taken in autumn 1994 was 
    a specific inspection of passenger ferry bow visors by the Gothenburg Shipinspec 
    office. Of the twelve ships examined within the Gothenburg area, eleven showed 
    deficiencies. These ranged from the formation of cracks in the locking devices 
    to operating system deficiencies. One vessel, the LION PRINCE, was not permitted 
    to sail, while heavy weather restrictions were imposed on certain other vessels.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Finally, the following 
    should be noted in this context. The mass media reported that the ESTONIA's 
    sister ship, DIANA II, nearly lost her bow visor between Trelleborg and Rostock 
    on the same stormy night in January 1993 when the Polish ferry JAN HEWELIUSZ 
    sank. However, no so-called Section 70 report was submitted to the Department's 
    Investigation Section as required by the existing regulations. Nor was this 
    event, as far as it is known, brought to the attention of the central authority 
    in any other way until after the loss of the ESTONA. The Department subsequently 
    submitted the question of the master's conduct for possible prosecution, but 
    the prosecutor decided not to bring an action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The DIANA II as well 
    as the also above-mentioned MARIELLA incident shall be explained in more detail 
    later on in this chapter. Before, however, the reaction of the administration 
    on the SAGA STAR accident shall be outlined as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">After survey the 
    chief inspector of the Malmö Shipinspec office, Åke Sjöblom, decided on 17 
    May 1982 that SAGA STAR could sail without the bow visor until the end of 
    May, provided that the weather was good, that the voyages were undertaken 
    at reduced speed, that due attention was paid to the other factors which might 
    affect the seaworthiness of the vessel and that the log extracts were submitted 
    to the Shipinspec after each voyage.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further 
    decided that complete drawings, together with calculation material for "bow 
    door", hinges and hydraulic arrangements should immediately be submitted to 
    the Shipinspec. Following a survey on 17 May 1982 Lloyd's Register of Shipping 
    awarded an Interim Classification Certificate in accordance with the Shipinspec's 
    decision. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The new bow visor 
    was surveyed and approved on 14 June 1982.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Classification 
    Society submitted the requested calculation material, and the then Safety 
    Section of Sjöfartsverket drew up its own highly comprehensive memorandum 
    with computation sheets. This memoran-dum is dated 14 July 1982 and was intended 
    to form the basis of discussions at a safety meeting. The memorandum proposed 
    that the Administration should determine how various forces are to be calculated. 
    There are also references to the accidents referred to above, and the fact 
    that these led to changes in the rules of the Classification Societies. It 
    was alleged also that the calculations submitted by the Societies indicated 
    inadequate engineering input on the calculation and design side, and it was 
    alleged that the Classification Societies did not monitor this aspect sufficiently. 
    It was mentioned for example that the bow doors of the VISBY and a vessel 
    named WASA STAR subsequently had to be strengthened. The author of the memorandum 
    expressed a desire for further Classification Society and yard calculation 
    material, and proposed that the Administration should take measures to prevent 
    further accidents of the kind in question. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    file the matter was finalised by the then acting Sea Safety Direction of Sjöfartsverket 
    who wrote to Lloyd's Register of Shipping on 21 September 1982, criticising 
    the Society's calculations and superinten-dence. The letter concludes as follows: 
    "The Administration requests that you test the suggestions made regarding 
    the present version and indicate the reinforcements that you consider necessary. 
    In view of the fact that the locking devices of bow visors broke open in bad 
    weather on a number of vessels, the Administration further requests you to 
    account for the dimensioning of the locking devices of this vessel." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Apparently the SAGA 
    STAR accident had triggered off even more activities within the Administration 
    as reflected in the letter that the then Safety Director, Per Eriksson, wrote 
    on 15.03.84 to Lorenzo Spinelli of the Italian Classification Society RINA 
    - see Enclosure 33.419. It reveals that the strength expert, Gunnar Hjertstedt, 
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfartsverket) had written a memo 
    after the cause investigation following the SAGA STAR accident and after the 
    subsequent discussions with Lloyd's Register, of which page 1 is available 
    and where among other things it is stated:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The correspondence 
      and discussions with the classification society involved in this problem 
      have shown that they consider the opening and closing arrangement of doors 
      as lifting appliances exempted from their surveys, except on special request 
      of the owner, while the other scantlings of the door and the locking arrangement 
      are subject to their control. <br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">To 
      this procedure the Swedish Administration of Shipping and Navigation (Note: 
      Sjöfartsverket) has the following objection. Details involved in the opening 
      and closing of bows are integrated parts of the doors, which we find difficult 
      to separate from the regulations concerning securing and the problem to 
      calculate and establish the scantlings of other details of the door. If 
      the control in this case is separated to different authorities the hazard 
      of missing important control objects is great, which has been demonstrated 
      in this case. The Administration of Shipping and Navigation would suggest 
      that this problem is discussed within IACS.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The memo had apparently 
    been written sometime in 1982, but in March 1984 the responsible safety director 
    was obviously not even certain whether he had passed it on to "dear Lorenzo" 
    when being reminded by his strength expert before his retirement, which is 
    another demonstration of the attitude of the responsible authorities in those 
    years. The only page available of this memo is attached together with another 
    page from another letter or memo signed by Gunnar Hjertstedt but without date 
    referring to the "closing and securing of doors" as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.420.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    33.420.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After each of the 
    above-mentioned accidents exclusively concerning bow doors of car/passenger 
    ferries or Ro-Ro cargo vessels which were only 1 year or less old - with the 
    exception of the SVEA STAR having been 8 years old - Shipinspec and/or Sjöfartsverket 
    only investigated against the Classification Societies, mainly Lloyd's Register 
    but also Bureau Veritas and Norske Veritas. The Building Yards are not even 
    mentioned and the Classification Societies were blamed for took weak construction 
    and/or under-dimensioned locking devices and hinges. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is, of course, 
    remarkable to note bearing in mind that the head of the Investigation Section 
    of the National Maritime Administration (Sjöfarts-verket) attended all the 
    meetings of the JAIC investigating the ESTONIA casualty, be it the official 
    full Commission meetings or the internal meetings of the Swedish part of the 
    JAIC where it had obviously been decided already shortly after the catastrophe 
    to put most of the blame on the Building Yard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Finally the report 
    of the Gothenburg office of the Shipinspec concerning the STENA SAILER accident 
    shall be quoted as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»On 2 May 1974, 
      a report was received from the Gothenburg Shipinspec office of a meeting 
      dealing with examination of bow door locking devices. From this report it 
      emerged that STENA SAILER's bow door had come open during a previous voyage. 
      It also appeared that the bow door of STENA SAILER's sister ship, the UNION 
      WELLINGTON under the New Zealand flag, despite having been reinforced, had 
      been opened during heavy weather. Another sister ship, the SEA TRADER, had 
      crossed the Atlantic in bad weather, but on this vessel the bow door had 
      been welded closed. The following may also be found in the report. "During 
      the meeting, it emerged that very little is known about the forces that 
      affect the bow door. However, through the trials conducted by G.L. (Note: 
      by Germanischer Lloyd), some slight under-standing of this has been gained. 
      It appeared that more or less all the locking devices on existing vessels 
      with bow doors are of too weak construction. That matters have gone as well 
      as they have so far is due to the fact that vessels with bow doors are mostly 
      used in restricted trades where they do not normally meet such heavy weather. 
      I propose that the Administration investigates how locking devices on bow 
      doors ought to be placed, designed and constructed, and that there should 
      then be a check on the locking devices of existing vessels. This presumably 
      will not be done by the Classification Societies, since after all these 
      have already approved the existing locking devices."«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Special 
    attention has to be drawn to the obvious fact that this proposal was made 
    already in May 1974 by the chief inspector of the Gothenburg office to the 
    National Maritime Administration - Sjöfartsverket.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The report of Magnus 
    Sjöberg on the STENA SAILER continues: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On 8 May 1974, 
      the Department wrote to Bureau Veritas, with which STENA SAILER was classified,

    DIANA II and VIKING SALLY (ESTONIA) were designed and built in 1978-1980 there 
    were no requirements at all in the Bureau Veritas Rules then in force (1977 
    Rules). This reveals from a letter that the BV head office wrote to the JAIC 
    on 10.01.95 where it is stated among other things: <i>»The bow door drawings 
    of the MV ESTONIA were reviewed by the Hamburg local office of Bureau Veritas

    Sally - simultaneously with VIKING SALLY - at the Turku Shipyard in 1980. 
    On 20.10.84 the vessel was on her scheduled voyage from Helsinki to Stockholm 
    and encountered a south-westerly wind of 14 m/s, i.e. Bft. 6-7, when at around 
    23.00 hours she was shaken hard by the sea, coming from ca. 3 point on port 
    side. The alarm of the locking device system was not activated. In Stockholm, 
    however, heavy structural damages in way of the port visor side were found 
    and temporary repairs were carried out. During the permanent repairs, performed 
    later, it was recommended to reinforce the visor. For particulars see the 
    survey reports attached in original and in office translation as Enclosure 
    33.421. Classification Society: Det norske Veritas (DnV).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>MARIELLA <br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Built for 
    Rederi AB Slite at Turku Shipyard and delivered in March 1985. On 07.11.85 
    the ferry was on her scheduled voyage from Helsinki to Stockholm, when at 
    around 23.00 hours she was hit in the front by an uncommonly high sea from 
    port which shook the vessel hard. Locking devices and hinges of the visor 
    broke, the visor was lifted up and remained connected to the ship only by 
    the visor actuators. Due to the enormous pressure, exerted on the pistons 
    during thrusting up the visor, the pistons were widened and the pressure lessened. 
    As a result thereof the visor came down again and the ingress of a large quantity 
    of water onto the car deck was only prevented by the immediately initiated 
    full-astern manoeuvre. The ship continued to Stockholm on very slow speed. 
    The Classification Society of MARIELLA was and is Det norske Veritas. At the 
    time of this incident the vessel was still under guarantee. It was considered 
    to exchange the heavily damaged visor with the identical visor of her sister 
    ship OLYMPIA which was still under construction at the Turku Shipyard, but 
    it was subsequently decided to repair and convert the visor on site while 
    the ferry kept trading and during which time the loading/discharging operations 
    were carried out exclusively via the stern ramps. The repairs, which also 
    included the locking devices being considerably reinforced, required about 
    5 months.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This incident, 
    which was probably the most serious visor damage of a car/passenger ferry 
    in the Baltic area before the ESTONIA catastrophe, led to considerable discussions 
    in the shipping industry. The fact that DnV participated in the inspections/meetings 
    with three Finnish representa-tives and one Swedish representative underlines 
    that the problems were realized and that it was clearly considered to be a 
    Class matter, the F.B.N. was not involved. After analysing the events it was 
    agreed that the immediate reduction of the speed and the turning of the stern 
    into the sea had finally prevented the loss of the visor and the subsequent 
    probably unavoidable catastrophe. - See the Inspection Report <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/33.422.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    33.422. </a><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The MARIELLA 
    - same as the ESTONIA - is equipped with a visor/bow ramp combination, i.e. 
    the upper part of the ramp extends into a deck house which is part of the 
    visor. In addition to this the vessel is equipped with a 2.50 m high and moveable 
    collision bulkhead on the car deck.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As a consequence 
    of the MARIELLA accident the locking devices for the bow visor of her sister 
    ship OLYMPIA, delivered in April 1986, were totally changed upon the instructions 
    of the Swedish Sjöfartsverket - inspector Lennart Ahlberg. The owner, Gustav 
    Myrsten, was reportedly personally handling the changes and reinforcements 
    of the locking devices. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently 
    the OLYMPIA was chartered by P&O and used in liner service between Southampton 
    and Bilbao. At the same time the Classification Society was changed from DnV 
    to Bureau Veritas (B.V.) and P&O ordered the installation of eight additional 
    locking devices in view of the regular crossing of the Bay of Biscay.</font></p>

    SF-Line, the third Viking Line partner, in 1973 as TURELLA by Sietas Werft, 
    Hamburg. She is a passenger/Ro-Ro cargo/ferry of 7984 gross tons and 1325 
    dwt, built to Lloyd's Register Class Rules and supervision and is classed 
    + 100 A1, Ice Class I, Ice Class IA, which corresponds to Finnish/Swedish 
    Ice Class Rules 1971. The vessel is fitted with a bow visor and ramp for vehicle 
    access at the forward end. At the aft end there is a stern door/ramp. The 
    mean draught is 5.35 m, while ESTONIA's draught was about 5.5 m. Information 
    was received from Helsinki about damage to the visor of this ferry having 
    been in bare-boat charter for Tallink (ESCO) from September 1993 to May 1994 
    between Helsinki and Tallinn. During this time the ferry experienced the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 11 January 
      1994 </b>- The bow visor was frozen in position above and below the Atlantic 
      lock, which was the modification fitted in 1982 consisting of a hydraulic 
      locking arrangement between the forepeak tank top below the bow ramp position 
      and the bottom of the visor. The visor could not be opened in Tallinn and 
      the vessel was discharged by the stern. The visor's lower area was heated 
      with steam hoses to clear the ice and then released. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- on 18 February 
      1994</b> - The starboard side bow plating, below the visor and in way of 
      the Atlantic lock space, was found to be heavily set in and the visor could 
      not be opened. After discharge of vehicles, on the early morning, the vessel 
      went to the Baltic Shipyard, where repairs were effected to the starboard 
      bow. See the attached photo documentation. After this incident on 18 February, 
      extreme care was taken when navigating in ice conditions, with the vessel 
      being trimmed by the stern to keep the visor higher above the waterline.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- on 29 March 
      1994</b> - The bow visor was found to be jammed and upon examination it 
      was noted that the port side bow shell plating, in way of the Atlantic lock 
      position, had been heavily set in, similar in nature to the damage noted 
      on the starboard side on 18 February 1994. Immediate temporary repairs were 
      carried out to allow the vessel to continue her service. On 4 April 1994 
      it became necessary to carry out some additional welding to the temporary 
      repair on the port side. Upon subsequent dry-docking it was found that extensive 
      damage to the shell plating on both sides had been sustained whilst the 
      bow visor was damaged as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Bow lower edge 
      plating, port and starboard buckled and set in and visor void tank possibly 
      breached.</font></p>
