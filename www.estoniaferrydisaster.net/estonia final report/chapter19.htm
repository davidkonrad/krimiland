<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">ESTONIA pulled 
    back from her berth on 27 September 1994 between 19.15 and 19.30 hours. <br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According 
    to the JAIC the vessel departed at 19.15 hours which is said to be a compromise 
    between the Swedish/Finnish and the Estonian Commis-sion members. While the 
    Estonians insisted on 19.00 hours at the beginning (because the departure 
    time has effect on the speed), the Swedes and the Finns referred to the statement 
    of Bengt Nilsson - see Enclosure 20.238 - who had testified as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The vessel 
      left the berth when they entered the restaurant, thus it must have been 
      19.30 hours or later, because the restaurant only opens at 19.30 hours.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Andi Meister has 
    written in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i>, chapter 7, page 118, 
    that the time 19.15 hours for ESTONIA's departure could be found in the logbook 
    of the harbour master of Tallinn.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Upon departure 
    the vessel's trim was said to have been 0.5 m by stern and she had a list 
    of 1° to starboard, although the port heeling tank was full and the starboard 
    heeling tank was said to have been empty and in spite of the fact that gale 
    force winds had been forecasted from SW-ly direction, i.e. from port side, 
    thus increasing the starboard heel without any possibility to counteract. 
    When interviewed in 7/1996 motorman Elmar Siegel stated in this respect:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Q: <i>"Did "Estonia" 
    leave Tallinn with some list?" <br>
    </i>A: <i>"Yes, a list to starboard. Leiger (chief engineer) had phoned the 
    engine room and asked whether it was possible to correct it. It was a mistake 
    made during loading. The tank at the side, which would have to be filled to 
    correct the list, was already full and the tank at the other side was already 
    empty. Therefore we had no possibility to correct the list. It was 1°-2° and 
    due to the waves up to 3°-4°."<br>
    </i></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The full 
    wording of the interview is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/13.192.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    13.192. </a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to the 
    crew member - car deck worker Valdur Matt - the bow ramp and visor were properly 
    closed and secured. He was probably the one who moved the turnable forward 
    parts of the bow-ramp rails into backward position and who secured both parts 
    by putting the pins into the respective holes before the bow ramp was lifted 
    up. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the passenger 
    Mikael Öun and others have stated that the visor was definitely closed or, 
    at least, looked closed from the open 8th deck when the ESTONIA pulled back 
    from her berth. Thereafter the passengers left the open deck because it was 
    windy and uncomfortable.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Since 17.00 
    hours on the same day the ferry SILJA FESTIVAL had been berthed opposite the 
    ESTONIA as pictured below. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In the cafeteria 
    of SILJA FESTIVAL on the 4th deck a Finnish Doctor was having coffee with 
    his son and thereby observed the unberthing manoeuvre of the ESTONIA. Her 
    report - submitted to the Finnish part of JAIC on 10.01.95 and received by 
    this 'Group of Experts' only in December 1998 - reads as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»On Tuesday, 
      27 September 1994, at 13.00 hours, I boarded the SILJA FESTIVAL in Helsinki 
      for a 24-hour cruise. I was accompanied by my son and we had a cabin together. 
      The ferry arrived at Tallinn at 17.00 hours the same day for a 4-hour stay. 
      Most of the passengers went ashore, but I stayed on board with my son and 
      we were walking around the vessel. At about 19.00 hours I was together with 
      my son in the cafeteria on the 4th deck having coffee. I saw through the 
      window that a vessel with the name ESTONIA was leaving the harbour at a 
      distance of about 20-25 m away from us. I knew the vessel from previous 
      times..... The weather was overcast and it was blowing moderately ....... 
      The day was just at dusk. I saw the vessel moving backwards from her berth 
      and saw that her bow visor was open. It seemed to me that it was not fully 
      open, but only half ....... I watched the ESTONIA for some minutes whereafter 
      her foreship disappeared from my view. I did not see whether the vessel's 
      so-called inner door was closed. While the vessel resumed her voyage I saw 
      that both stern ramps were closed. I followed ESTONIA's departing for about 
      5 minutes whereafter the vessel disappeared into the darkness.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
      mentioned to my son that the bow visor stood open and told him that for 
      the same reason a Belgian vessel had sunk some time ago. I was informed 
      by crew members of our vessel on the next morning at about 10.00 hours that 
      the ESTONIA had sunk.« <br>
      </font></i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The complete 
      statement is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/19.236.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      19.236.</a></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above drawing 
    shows ESTONIA with half open visor. This means that the crew apparently at 
    first closed the visor while the vessel proceeded backwards from the berth 
    and, subsequently, when she had turned inside the breakwater opened it again 
    to a certain extent, possibly half, and passed the breakwater in that condition. 
    <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The explanation 
    for this somewhat unusual behaviour was most probably the impossibility for 
    the crew to close the bow ramp completely, i.e. the ramp was closed by the 
    actuators to about 4-5 cm, whereafter normally the two ramp hooks would engage 
    the mating lugs at the upper part of the ramp and pull the ramp tight against 
    the rubber packings, whereafter the securing bolts would move one after the 
    other into mating pockets at the ramp; This was, however, no more possible 
    due to the severe twisting/misalignment of the ramp. This is subsequently 
    explained in detail in Subchapter 29.2, viz.: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) the port upper 
    pocket was intact and only slightly bent towards the centre-line of the ramp 
    with metal at both sides of the pocket slightly ripped which was probably 
    caused by the bending; the bolt was fully extended and about 100 mm below 
    the pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (b) the port lower 
    pocket was found to be intact with the bolt only partly extended and about 
    100 mm below the pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) The starboard 
    upper pocket was noted to be without cover plate which had been burnt off 
    by the crew in the morning of 27 September 1994 after arrival when it turned 
    out to be impossible to open the bolt; the bolt was fully extended; there 
    was apparently no misalignment between bolt and pocket;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) the starboard 
    lower pocket was crushed together to the effect that the bolt - noted to be 
    fully extended - could never have entered the pocket. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently it has 
    not been possible for the crew to secure the bow ramp at all by its four securing 
    bolts. The same refers to the port ramp hook which could not engage its mating 
    lug at the ramp, due to the misalignment of the port ramp side as it was demonstrated 
    already by the distance of ca. 100 mm between the mating pockets and bolts. 
    The obvious fact that the port ramp hook had never engaged its mating lug 
    is further confirmed by the intact hook and the intact, unbroken lug. Both 
    hook and lug are visible among other things on the diver video B40a. - See 
    also Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    ramp hook, however, is nowhere visible and the location where it should be, 
    is empty. It has thus to be assumed that also this hook had not engaged its 
    mating lug at the ramp, which means that the ramp had just been closed by 
    the actuators - as stated before - to an remaining opening of 4-5 cm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to several 
    mooring ropes and two wires found in way of the ramp and respective indications 
    on the ramp - see Chapter 29.2 - it has to be assumed that the crew tried 
    to close the ramp completely by means of mooring ropes and/or wires probably 
    pulled tight by means of the mooring winches on the forecastle deck. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Subsequently the 
    visor was closed and locked - see Subchapter 29.2 and Chapter 30 - while the 
    ferry proceeded already outside the breakwater towards the VTS between the 
    Island Nayssaar and the mainland on her last, fatal voyage in a condition 
    which shall again be summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged 
    and misaligned visor, which at sea quickly filled up with water to the outside 
    level, which was also insufficiently locked and secured, and the hinges of 
    which were considerably pre-damaged and weakened, in particular the starboard 
    hinge.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - Severely damaged 
    and misaligned bow ramp, which was not locked at all but most likely held 
    by one or more mooring rope(s)/wires, which was open to the water-filled visor, 
    with the port hinges being broken and the ramp detached from the vessel at 
    this side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The car deck loaded 
    with only partly or not all secured trucks/trailers and other vehicles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The port heeling 
    tank full while the starboard one was allegedly empty, a condition depriving 
    the vessel's command subsequently of being able to counteract when the vessel's 
    starboard heel increased due to the forecasted wind pressure on the port side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - One or more ballast 
    water tanks and/or void spaces being holed/leaking and consequently open to 
    sea. In short, the ferry ESTONIA was in many respects unseaworthy when she 
    departed from her home port for the last time as it is also demonstrated by 
    the images below.</font></p>
