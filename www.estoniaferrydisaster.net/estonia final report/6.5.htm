  Take-over and Change of Flag</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">N&T had arranged 
    for some officers, engineers and ratings to be trained on WASA KING already 
    since November/December 1992. Thus at least some of the Estonian crew members 
    had some basic knowledge about the new vessel. Also some of the Swedish advisers 
    spent some time on WASA KING, inter alia, the first nautical adviser to the 
    Estonian captains, Anders Andersson, who had been sacked after repeated clashes 
    with Captain Arvo Andresson already in June 1993, while his wife Marlene stayed 
    in her capacity as hotel and restaurant manager until July 1994. Their testimonies 
    to the public prosecutor shall be discussed in Subchapter 7.1.3.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The vessel 
    was drydocked between 4-8 January 1993 and the necessary inspections were 
    carried out. As has already been explained in Subchapter 3.4 above at this 
    time also some maintenance work was performed which was partly ordered by 
    the old owners, Wasa Line, and partly by the technical managers of the new 
    owners, N&T. The executed repair work, however, constituted only less than 
    a fraction of what had been intended to be carried out by Wasa Line at the 
    scheduled docking time in January 1993 had the ferry remained with them. This 
    must be concluded from the following comparison between</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has to be assumed 
    that these requirements of the experienced Finnish crew of WASA KING came 
    to the knowledge of N&T during or before the time of take-over of the ferry, 
    however, <b>nothing at all was done by N&T to rectify the deficiencies of 
    the locking devices, hinges and rubber packings of the visor and the bow ramp 
    which were obviously due to wear and tear after 12 years in service.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Nevertheless, the 
    responsible Technical Director of N&T and Board-member of Estline, Sten-Christer 
    Forsberg, replied to the question of the reporter Erik Ridderstolpe on the 
    Swedish Radio on 11.12.97: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Forsberg</b>: 
      <i>«I admit the responsibility of N&T for the condition of the visor and 
      the too weak locking devices had we known it, however, I saw the repair

      of the Commission.»<br>

    </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is, of course, 
    possible that Forsberg himself was unaware of this tender specification at 
    the time of the take-over, however, this certainly cannot be accepted for 
    the superintendent Ulf Hobro, the technical no. 2 after Forsberg, who was 
    representing N&T and the owners at Turku during the take-over as well as during 
    all previous inspections of the vessel. See further in Subchapter 12.5 below.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On 15 January 
    1993 the vessel was formally handed over to the new owners and her name was 
    changed to ESTONIA, the home port to Tallinn and the flag to Estonian. <br>

    list <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.1.123.htm" target="_blank">(Enclosure 6.5.1.123</a>) 
    contains quite a number of names of crew members who were also on board on 
    the last voyage, only very few of whom survived. The first Estonian master 
    was Arvo Andresson and his nautical adviser was Anders Andersson, whilst the 
    first chief engineer was Harli Moosaar and his technical adviser was Tomas 
    Rasmusson. These two as well as all the other "advisers" were employed by 
    Hornet AB on behalf of N&T (see CV Tomas Rasmusson attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/6.5.1.124.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    6.5.1.124</a>). </font></p>

    drydocking in March 1993. The surveyor approved the vessel for entry into 
    the new Hull and P&I covers without any condition whatsoever. According to 
    a statement of Ulf Hobro made before the JAIC in February 1995 visor and bow 
    ramp as well as locking devices and indicator lights were function tested 
    at Turku and everything was found to be in order. It is obvious that Hobro 
    and/or Wirstam paid no attention to the items in the repair specification/quotation 
    dated 25.09.92, which they had received from the previous owners as explained 
    on the previous pages.</font></p>
