<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>THE DIVING INVESTIGATION 
  01.-04.12.94</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">From 1st to 
    4th December 1994 the wreck was examined by divers from Rockwater A/S Stavanger 
    and by ROVs from Smit Tak, Rotterdam (parent company of Rockwater A/S) apparently 
    contracted by the Swedish Sjöfarts-verket. The divers were working out of 
    diving bells from the diving support vessel SEMI I. Börje Stenström, member 
    of the Swedish part and head of the technical group, was said to have been 
    the only member of the JAIC on board. In addition, there were on board Arne 
    Valgma, head of the Estonian Ship Safety Division of the E.N.M.B., Ulf Hobro 
    from Nordström & Thulin, the responsible director Johan Fransson and the operations 
    manager Åke Vide from Sjöfartsverket, a number of Swedish criminal police 
    officers, one English salvage expert and the Swedish diving expert Gustav 
    Hanuliak, both on behalf of Sjöfartsverket, as well as some persons unidentified 
    so far.</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> It 
      is doubtful whether Börje Stenström was the only JAIC representative on 
      board as it would be against the general attitude of the Finns demonstrated 
      before and after the diving investigation, namely to be represented by their 
      own people whenever relevant parts of the investigation were carried out. 
      Since the diving investigation of the wreck was the most relevant part of 
      the investigation so far, it has to be assumed that Finland was represented 
      by Tuomo Karppinen, as testified by Arne Valgma who attended on board.<br>
      This assumption is shared by the then chairman of the JAIC, Andi Meister, 
      in his book <i>"The Unfinished Logbook"</i>, where he states that the Estonian 
      participant Arne Valgma shared his monitor cabin with Tuomo Karppinen from 
      the Finnish part of JAIC. According to Andi Meister this was subsequently 
      denied by the Finns who - for understandable reasons - did not want to take 
      over part of the responsibility for the occurrences on board of the diving 
      platform SEMI 1 such as the wilful manipulation and deletion of essential 
      evidence in which Mr. Karppinen most likely participated.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The main purpose 
    of the diving operation, which was paid by the Swedish Government, was to 
    establish:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) Could the 
      ESTONIA be lifted up as a whole? <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) How many 
      bodies could be recovered without lifting the vessel, and<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(c) would 
      it be possible to cover the ESTONIA with stones/concrete?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The results are 
    outlined in two official reports available to the public, viz. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Condition 
      Survey of the vessel ESTONIA for the Swedish National Maritime Administration 
      by Rockwater A/S, Stavanger (attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.409.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      27.409</a>), and<br>
      - Survey Report M.V. ESTONIA dated 08.12.94 by Smit Tak B.V., Rotterdam 
      (attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
      27.410</a>).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, the 
    divers had to inspect and record on video tapes the foreship area as well 
    as the navigation bridge on behalf of the JAIC and according to the instructions 
    of Börje Stenström and/or Tuomo Karppinen. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to 
    the Rockwater Report to Sjöfartsverket the underwater work was documented 
    on 19 video tapes which were handed over to Sjöfartsverket/Swedish criminal 
    police before they left the diving platform by helicopter. Allegedly Rockwater 
    kept only those videos on which the safety of the divers was documented, in 
    case health problems should appear, which was not the case. Those videos allegedly 
    were destroyed one week after the last diver entered the bell.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">At a subsequent 
    meeting in Helsinki on 02.10.96 between the JAIC and the Rockwater representatives 
    Ray Honour, managing director / Dave Cawson, project manager / Terry Jost, 
    diver (one of the two divers having examined the bridge) the following was 
    established: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»Whatever the 
      divers did was documented in detail by Rockwater in three different logbooks. 
      It is possible to check each individual episode by comparing the entries 
      in the logbooks with the video logs respectively with the videos themselves. 
      It can be excluded that sequences have been removed from the videos. On 
      some tapes date and times are recorded, on others not because the input 
      had to be made in the operation room which was not done with all tapes. 
      The conditions were very difficult, the visibility was poor, each movement 
      caused a cloud of settled-down sediments.« </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The diving operation 
    was performed by four teams of three divers who worked around the clock from 
    two diving bells hanging next to the wreck. The first diver of the team remained 
    in the bell, the other two proceeded to the designated area where one did 
    the work according to instructions from the supervisor in the operation room 
    while the other secured him by checking his umbilical, etc. The divers worked 
    in diving suits with helmets, which were connected by the said umbilical containing 
    all the necessary supply and communication lines to the diving bell respectively 
    to the diving platform. On top of the helmets one searchlight and one, probably 
    two, video cameras were mounted. The diver received his instructions through 
    two earphones - one in each ear - and spoke into one microphone. On the video 
    tapes available to the public only the voice of the supervisor into one of 
    the earphones and the voice of the diver are audible. Only on some occasions 
    does it become evident that the diver gets additional respectively other instructions 
    when he reacts differently or replies differently, this being particularly 
    obvious when he quickly turns his head away from areas which the public should 
    not see as will be explained on the following pages. It is common practice 
    - according to the diving expert Brian Braidwood - that divers carry two different 
    earphones during an operation like the one under consider-ation here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following pictures 
    show two of the Rockwater divers with diving suit, helmets and umbilical.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Due to being 100% 
    supplied and disposed off via the umbilical these divers do not create air 
    bubbles in the water. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The video films 
    were produced in the PAL format by the cameras on the helmets of the divers. 
    <br>

    films the following are available to this 'Group of Experts': </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Also these films 
    were handed over to the video experts of Disengage/UK for analysis and evaluation 
    - see Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One of the 
    results was that - except videos 11 and 18 - all other video films - although 
    made in the PAL format - had been copied by a PAL/SECAM machine without a 
    converter in between. This results in poor copies, which are much too light 
    and unclear - a fact which makes a proper evaluation of the video material 
    very difficult, sometimes impossible. In addition, relevant parts had been 
    cut out of these videos as will also be demonstrated in Subchapter 34.6.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">These videos 
    were and still are being copied in Sweden by a private company called "FORSVARSMEDIA" 
    which is said to work exclusively for the Ministry of Defence, and as such 
    has security clearance. Reportedly Börje Stenström had decided before any 
    copying was done which parts should be hidden from the public and cut out. 
    These concern footage showing the hull above the starboard mudline including 
    the starboard stabiliser and certain areas of the foreship and the bodies 
    inside the wreck and on the bridge. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">While the video 
    sequences showing undesired parts of the wreck were deleted - which fact has 
    led to the discrepancies in the timing as shown by Disengage (see Subchapter 
    34.6) - the bodies have been made invisible by light spots, also the three 
    "official" bodies on the bridge. Even though it is stated in the Rockwater 
    Report, among other things: »The bodies on the bridge showed signs of decomposition, 
    but were also undamaged.«, and the Sjöfartsverket Report added: »On the bridge, 
    where many windows were missing, one body had been attacked by fish.«, the 
    bodies on the bridge were allegedly not identified by their uniforms. This 
    was explained by Börje Stenström, as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»The divers 
      did not know any of the victims personally. So, how could they identify 
      them?«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">By 
    the stripes on their uniforms, as it had initially been assumed that all victims 
    were officers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This is most annoying, 
    because the question who was on the bridge during the final minutes is of 
    importance, in particular, whether the master was there.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the distress 
    communication it is known that the watch officer - 2nd mate Tormi Ainsalu 
    - the 3rd mate Andres Tammes and most probably also chief officer Juhan Herma 
    - had been on the bridge until 01.30 hours - the end of the 'Mayday' communication 
    - see Subchapter 22.1 - when the vessel was practically on the side. Of these 
    three Ainsalu and Tammes were seen by Sillaste to leave the bridge, while 
    Herma apparently remained inside. According to 3rd engineer Margus Treu, he 
    was asked by 4th mate Kaimar Kikas at a rather late stage after the diesel 
    generators had already shut down, whether he could pump freshwater overboard 
    from the starboard tanks. Thus it could be assumed that the 4th mate also 
    stayed in the bridge. The third body should be the master according to the 
    "evidence" of watch A.B. Silver Linde, which in all probability is wrong because 
    he had not been back to the bridge before, at or after 01.00 hours - see Subchapter 
    21.2.2. Nevertheless, the crew survivors were very certain from the beginning 
    that Captain Andresson had died on the bridge, which is not surprising because 
    it has to be assumed with certainty that at least one of the surviving officers/engineers 
    had been on the bridge after the big heel and seen what had happened.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary this 
    would explain the three bodies as found by the divers, viz. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">1) close to the 
      door leading out to the aft on port side, across the door leading to the 
      inside stairway.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">2) inside 
      the chart room without further details.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">3) in the 
      starboard wing below the broken loose flagbox.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The above is revealed 
    from the voice communication between two divers and the supervisors on board 
    the SEMI 1 according to video tapes B40c and B40d which are available and 
    from the Finnish report of the JAIC, page 131. In addition, more information 
    about the bodies became publicly known partly through the Andi Meister book 
    "The Unfinished Logbook" and partly through the Estonian media. These are:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the body at 
      the aft port door was wearing a brown or red/brown suit.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the body 
      underneath the flagbox in the starboard bridge wing had a tattoo on his 
      right hand.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Reportedly neither 
    Captain Andresson nor Juhan Herma nor Kaimar Kikas had a tattoo on their right 
    hand and certainly none of them was wearing a brown or red/brown suit. So, 
    who are the three bodies on the bridge and where does this information come 
    from? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On the other hand, 
    the detailed knowledge of the Estonians about the condition of the bodies 
    inside the bridge indicates that they had been there with own divers. Furthermore, 
    neither the descriptions above nor the few words of the divers audible on 
    the videos indicate that any of these bodies was badly decomposed and/or had 
    been attacked by fish.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The explanation 
    for this discrepancy was discovered by Disengage when analysing the available 
    footage frame by frame. They found out that the first diver inspecting the 
    bridge - Dave Mawston - before entering the port bridge wing through the lower 
    aft window, which was already broken, cleared away the glass remains and mashwire 
    and then pulled out a body by the hair to the outside where he let it go. 
    This body was only approximately half a body because the lower half was missing, 
    possibly due to having been attacked by fish or by being badly decomposed? 
    Whatever the cause for this terrible injury might have been, this body was 
    neither found near the port aft door nor in the chartroom nor in the starboard 
    wing below a flagbox; it was removed from the bridge before the first diver 
    entered the bridge and before the aforementioned three bodies were found. 
    Consequently there had been a fourth body on the bridge, the existence of 
    which is not mentioned by the Swedish participants. The evaluation of the 
    so-called "Mudline video", showing the starboard hull - and bottom area in 
    way of the mudline, revealed the existence of a fifth body just outside the 
    starboard bridge wing which is also nowhere mentioned. - See Subchapter 34.6. 
    Apparently the Swedes in the JAIC were also hiding these bodies from the only 
    Estonian participant of the diving investigation, Arne Valgma, who was said 
    to have been sleeping during the first inspection of the bridge, because he 
    had been told that nothing special would happen during the hours ahead. He 
    was interviewed on the subject by Spiegel TV, but the interview is not available. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The question remains: 
    Why didn't the Swedes onboard the SEMI 1 arrange for proper identification 
    of the bodies on the bridge and why do they keep secret the fourth and the 
    fifth body?<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There were 
    several other incidents respectively observations during the diving survey 
    to which attention has to be drawn, viz.: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(1) The torn and 
      broken open underside of the starboard bridge wing. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(2) The inspection 
      of particular cabins on the 6th deck. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(3) The inspection 
      of the forward part of the 1st deck and the 0-deck. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(4) The ROV 
      "inspection" of the car deck and the consequences.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(5) The activities 
      of other divers with other equipment inside the car deck. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(6) The condition 
      of the rails and the preventer wires of the bow ramp.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(7) The angle 
      iron in the housing of the port bow ramp actuator. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(8) The condition 
      of the starboard stern ramp. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">None of all 
      this is mentioned in the JAIC Report.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is quite obvious 
    that part of the damage did exist already on 02.10.94, i.e. 4 days after the 
    casualty when the first (official) ROV went down and that the damage was enlarged 
    during the time until the diving investigation of 01.-04.12.94. The damage 
    is not mentioned in either the Smit-Tak/Rockwater Reports nor in the Sjöfartsverket 
    or JAIC Reports and has also not been discussed by the media.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This damage 
    cannot be attributed to the casualty and also does not look as having been 
    caused by fire or explosion. It is however obvious that there is heavy impact 
    damage at the aft lower part of the bulkhead which together with the vertical 
    stanchion supporting the wing was pushed forward. It therefore has to be assumed 
    that this was caused by interested parties searching for something particular 
    hidden inside the void space between the bridge floor and wing underside, 
    prior to and again after 02.10.94.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>as to (2): The 
    inspection of particular cabins on deck 6.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">According to video 
    B40a and the video tape log page - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411</a> - the diver entered the forward part of deck 6 and tried to enter 
    cabin 6132, which had been occupied by a member of the Stockholm Police ST-Section, 
    but failed, then tried the next cabin 6135 but failed again and then 6134 
    also without success. The diver returned to the outside for tools and moved 
    in again, broke open cabin 6132 - found a suitcase without name tag and left 
    it behind. He then worked his way to cabin 6230 which was the 2nd cabin from 
    port side of the four luxury cabins in the fore part of deck 6 overlooking 
    the foreship. According to the statement of purser Andres Vihmar of 15.05.96 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.195.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.195</a> - this cabin had been assigned to the master of the second crew, 
    Captain Avo Piht. In the alleyway in front of this cabin the diver found a 
    body. The diver, obviously receiving instructions through his second earphone 
    not audible on the available video, broke up the door and headed straight 
    for a suitcase, which was open but - according to the diver - apparently nothing 
    was missing (how could he know?) and the suitcase had a label with the name 
    Alexander Vorodin. The diver carried the suitcase out of the accommodation 
    and it was apparently hoisted up to the diving platform. The diver subsequently 
    broke open or tried to break open the cabins in the vicinity of cabin 6230, 
    all of which had been occupied by members of the ST-Section of the Stockholm 
    Police. The owner of the suitcase, Alexander Vorodin, had been on board together 
    with his uncle and nephew, and all three survived. According to the first 
    and only statement of Alexander Vorodin and to the 2nd statement of his uncle, 
    Vasili Krjutjkov, they had been in cabin 6320. In his 1st statement Vasili 
    Krjutjkov testified, however, that they had been in cabin 6230 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/14.196.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    14.196</a> - which was indirectly confirmed by his young nephew Vassili Vorodin 
    - see his statement <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.3.4.341.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.3.4.341</a> - who testified that he had been thrown out of his bed to the 
    floor by the big heel and thereafter they had looked out of the window and 
    seen the vessel heeling heavily to starboard. As can be seen from the drawing 
    below showing the forepart of deck 6 - cabin 6320 is an inner cabin without 
    windows and with only 2 beds (1 upper/1 lower) which are arranged athwartships, 
    thus no one would be thrown out these beds if the vessel suddenly heeled to 
    starboard. Cabin 6230, however, has 2 upper and 2 lower beds which are arranged 
    in longitudinal direction, i.e. if the vessel suddenly heeled to starboard 
    somebody in the port side beds could be thrown to the floor as it happened 
    to Vassili Vorodin. Furthermore this cabin has two windows overlooking the 
    foreship.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Consequently the 
    Vorodins had been in cabin 6230 which is also confirmed by the presence of 
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin in this cabin. The question is why did Andres 
    Vihmar testify to the police that it was the cabin of Captain Avo Piht where 
    the suitcase of Alexander Vorodin was found, who had the reputation of being 
    a weapons smuggler, and was therefore so interesting to the criminal police 
    of Stockholm. A transcript with the voice communication during the above explained 
    examinations is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.412.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (3): The 
    inspection of the forward part of the 1st deck and the 0-deck.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to video 
    tape log RW/SEMiI/EST/D/011 page 1 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411.1</a> - the diver S. Jessop entered the forward part of the 1st deck 
    through an opening cut by the divers into the shell plating. He examined the 
    port side cabins, established that the only accessible watertight door was 
    closed (all doors close from port to starboard, thus it has to be assumed 
    that the door had closed by gravity due to the starboard list after the hydraulic 
    pressure had slackened sometime after the sinking) and then - according to 
    the video log proceeded at 14.54 hours <b>towards the spiral stairway</b>, 
    which<b> only leads to the sauna and swimming pool compartments on 0-deck</b>, 
    where damage to the starboard shell plating is assumed. Without any notation 
    in between the log continues after 1 hour and 6 minutes without any explanation 
    as to what the diver did during this time. Thereafter the diver left the wreck 
    through the outside opening. The lower part of the video log page No. 1 - 
    <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.411.1.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.411.1</a> - shows the respective entries. Apparently the times 14.54 and 
    16.00 have been manipula- ted and the page was cut between these figures, 
    something which had been written in between has been taken out and both parts 
    of the page copied together. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The part taken 
    away concerns the activity of the diver between 14.54 and 16.00 in the area 
    at the end of the spiral stairway which is the 0-deck with sauna- and swimming-pool 
    compartments. It is obvious that the JAIC did not desire that the inspection 
    results were made public. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (4): The 
    ROV has not been inside the car deck and the consequences.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In spite of five 
    attempts and although the supervisor says so, the ROV cannot have entered 
    the car deck through the bow ramp opening, because</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (a) the video 
      sequences do not confirm this, and <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) the video 
      depth shown on the ROV display - 81 m - is too deep for the car deck. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless the 
    ROV moves between pallets with cement bags and other objects looking like 
    cargo apparently lying on the sea bottom. As it is highly unlikely that this 
    intact looking cargo originates from other vessels, it must have come from 
    ESTONIA even though the bow ramp and both stern ramps are closed or almost 
    closed. Although the starboard stern ramp was certainly more open at some 
    stage when the vessel was still afloat and severely heeled, it is very difficult 
    to assume that cement bags on pallets should have fallen off some truck or 
    trailer and then out through the open ramp and exactly next to the position 
    where the vessel finally settled down. The respective video is B40b from 03.12.1994. 
    Another open question which demands clarification. See also Subchapter 34.6.

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>as to (5): Divers 
    with other equipment were active inside the car deck.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On video B40c the 
    "official" diver was working on top of the bow ramp looking into the car deck 
    when suddenly a frogman type diver appeared in the beam of his searchlight 
    who rapidly tried to get away by swimming backwards, however, was picked-up 
    by the camera. <br>
    On another occasion air bubbles are coming up from the car deck, although 
    the "official" divers do not produce air bubbles and allegedly were not working 
    inside the car deck at all. On a further occasion lights can be seen inside 
    the car deck, although the "official" divers have not been there.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On another 
    occasion the supervisor said: <i>"They are getting their diver(s) back." </i>or 
    <i>"We have to wait until they get their divers back." </i>On another occasion 
    the supervisor said to the diver:<i> "We have to stay on the outside, the 
    inside is no good for us" </i>obviously meaning the car deck. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All this indicates 
    that another diving operation by other divers went on simultaneously, longer 
    or shorter, than the official one and it is indeed the question what these 
    divers were doing inside the car deck and why their activity was and still 
    is kept secret?</font></p>

    Further analysis of this footage revealed that this was an angle iron (arrow

    this steel piece had been placed there deliberately by the crew to prevent 
    the actuator fastening from hooking at the edge of the front bulkhead because 
    the ramp had been considerably hanging down with its port side due to the 
    broken port hinges which had destroyed the initial alignment of the actuator 
    fastenings in the vessel and at the ramp.</font></p>

    the bridge is mentioned in the Report of the JAIC.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another result of 
    the diving investigation was the apparent fact that the entire starboard bilge 
    strake area including the adjacent shell plating pointing up to car deck level 
    was accessible and could thus be inspected by divers and ROVs, which was done. 
    The results, as far as they are possible to achieve from the severely censored 
    "Mudline video", are outlined in Subchapter 29.5. The drawing below demonstrate 
    the condition of the wreck. They were taken from the Smit Tak Survey Report 
    dated 08.12.94 and attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%203/27.410.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    27.410. </a></font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After having measured 
    the bolt of the Atlantic lock Börje Stenström threw it back into the sea, 
    although according to his own scenario it was one of the most important pieces 
    of evidence. This will be explained in Subchapter 29.2.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the sensor 
    plate of the Atlantic lock and the electric cables of the sensors were cut 
    off by one diver, but instead of putting them into the net together with the 
    other objects brought to the surface, the diver threw both to the sea bottom 
    apparently upon instruction of the supervisor.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The other objects 
    recovered by the divers upon instructions of the police or other organisations 
    are unknown to the public. </font></p>
