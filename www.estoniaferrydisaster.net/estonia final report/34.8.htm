    <i>Defect and Failure Analysis of the Bow Visor Structure of the M. V. "Estonia"</i><br>
    by the Laboratory for Materials Technology and Welding<br>
    Techniques of the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> As a further consequence 
    of the finding that the Atlantic lock would only be exposed to excessive loads 
    if the visor hinges had partly or completely failed, the Laboratory for Materials 
    Technology and Welding Techniques of the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg 
    was instructed to examine the hinge remains which had meanwhile been cut off 
    the visor at Hangö and transported to the Royal Technical Institute (KTH), 
    Stockholm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The investigation 
    was subsequently extended to the connecting and supporting structural elements 
    between the visor and hull, i.e. in addition to the visor hinges also the 
    visor actuator mountings on D-deck, the side lock locations between visor 
    and hull, the Atlantic lock location between visor and hull and the visor 
    stempost area were examined. The investigations also included a visual examination 
    of the parts cut off the MARE BALTICUM ex DIANA II. The results of the difficult 
    and long lasting examinations, partly carried out at KTH, Stockholm, shall 
    be summarised as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(1) The visor 
    stempost </b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The welds between 
    stempost and shell plating of the visor had failed already during normal service 
    by a spectrum of cyclic loading providing tensile stress at the crack initiation 
    points together with long term corrosive action of seawater after opening 
    of the welds. As a consequence the stempost had not only been separated from 
    the shell plating during normal service but the stempost being a vital part 
    in its load-carrying function was in itself found to be split up into four 
    parts by crack development well before the casualty. The drawing on the next 
    page shows the cracks F1 - F4 of which F1 had penetrated the thickness of 
    the stempost to about 40% and blue paint was found inside the crack. It could 
    be verified that these traces of blue paint originated from penetration of 
    the outside paint into the crack opening at the time the crack had penetrated 
    the stempost already to the extent of about 40% of its thickness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Reference 
    is made to Section 12.5 where the application of ice paint INERTA is explained 
    in January 1994, when the ESTONIA had been in the shipyard for the last time, 
    thus at that time the stempost was already cracked by ca. 40%.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1189.jpg" width="517" height="352"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation 
    of fracture F1 - F4 ascertained that all the transverse fracture had started 
    and penetrated from the outside by corrosion assisted fatigue cracking. In 
    addition, fractures F2 and F3 reveal major bending displacements of their 
    flanks, in particular fracture F3 reveals a specific bending angle of about 
    70° combined with severe bending deformation following the original crack 
    development. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(2) The Atlantic 
    lock</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The inspection 
    of the original lug remains recovered from the wreck of the ESTONIA at KTH, 
    Stockholm revealed that the failure of the Atlantic lock took place by rupture 
    of the 3 lugs welded to the forepeak deck of the ferry, viz. at first to their 
    circular welds to the housing/bushing, subsequently in the remaining cross 
    sections by overload shear at about 40° to the mounting plane on forepeak 
    deck, whereby also bending distortion prior to final cracking of the assembly 
    was found.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visor mating 
    lug was found to be deformed by bending of about 15°-20° to starboard whereby 
    apparently a crack had opened in the weld between the visor bottom plating 
    and a vertical support stiffener.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The bore of 
    this mating lug had an original diameter of 85 mm, however, which was measured 
    to be 91 x 105 mm with an oval deformation towards forward indicating the 
    main force direction to have been aft.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note: </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is a confirmation of the structural analysis of the visor by the FE method 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%204/34.2.430.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    34.2.430</a> - according to which the force direction at the Atlantic lock 
    was found to be <b>aft as long as the visor hinges were intact.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another downward 
    bending movement of about 8°-10° was found which indicated forward tilting 
    of the visor bottom prior to the failure of the lock.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Note:</b> </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
    is only possible if the hinges had failed already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It was further found 
    that the position and shape of the visor's mating lug did not fully comply 
    with the available drawings, thus changes had been made during the life of 
    the vessel. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Further examinations 
    revealed that about 90% of the length of welds between the lugs on the forepeak 
    deck and the bushing/housing had been pre-cracked by fatigue. The crack propagation 
    together with the corrosion showed a similar picture as found on the visor 
    stempost.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In summary 
    of the above it can be concluded that the welding seams between the lugs on 
    the forepeak deck and the bushing/housing as well as the welding seams between 
    when the visor lug and the visor bottom have been considerable pre-cracked 
    by fatigue.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Deformation 
    indicate a sideways and downwards movement of the visor during final failure 
    of the Atlantic lock.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(3) The side 
    locks</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    lug has been torn off the visor bulkhead in such a way that the crack started 
    at the upper edge of the weld between the lug and the visor plating, then 
    propagation in a downward direction, being inclined to starboard by about 
    20° against the vertical, leaving a steel tongue at an angle of more than 
    90° to the bulkhead surface before final separation of the lug from the visor 
    plating.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The port lug 
    location indicates a more vertical down tearing movement during crack propagation 
    without leaving a steel tongue before failure. No detailed investigation of 
    the character of the fractures have been performed nor were the welding seam 
    remains examined.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(4) Actuator 
    mountings on B-deck</b><br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard 
    actuator was torn off from the supporting B-deck structure, whereby the welds 
    failed first and the vertical stiffeners below the B-deck plating subsequently, 
    leaving strongly deformed steel tongues behind. Inspection of the dismounted 
    port actuator revealed a repair weld in way of the vertical stiffener at a 
    location with possible high stress during the opening procedure. Investigation 
    revealed the fatigue cracked area to cover 50-70% of the total load-carrying 
    area of this weld.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>(5) Actuator 
    hinges at the visor arms</b><br>
    At a distance of 1300 mm forward of the visor's main hinges the actuator hinges 
    (fastening) were fitted underneath the visor arms and permitted the actuators' 
    sideways movements up to an angle of 15°. No specific structural failures 
    could be found by visual inspection. Severe scratch marks were found with 
    complete removal of the paint at an angle of 8-10° against the horizontal. 
    At the linear forward edges of the lug plates deeper surface damage had been 
    caused as compared to the curved aft edges. It can be concluded that these 
    scratch marks are a result of the cutting process of the lug plates through 
    the forecastle deck plating. The scratch mark inclination of 8°-10° against 
    the visor arm would coincide with a forward rotation of the visor around the 
    Atlantic lock while the lug plates were cutting through the deck structure 
    and the side locks had failed already. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(6) The visor 
    hinges</b><br>
    The visor's hinge system design consisted of the starboard and port side hinge 
    arms fabricated from structural platings, with two attached lug plates on 
    each side, carrying support bushings with bronze liners in the respective 
    bore holes. The support bushings were welded to the lug plates with circular 
    fillet welds. The visor hinge lugs were mated by deck hinge fittings, represented 
    by lugs welded to the forecastle deck. The mechanical connection was one bolt 
    on each side. The video image below shows the starboard hinge arm shortly 
    be- fore the accident.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The following picture 
    shows the broken port visor lug plates with the frac-tures A1, A2, A5 and 
    A6. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1193b.jpg" width="270" height="385"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The outer port side 
    shows a vertical to slightly horizontal bending to port side at the fracture 
    at the lower part of the remaining bore. The inner port side lug and both 
    starboard lugs - see picture below - did not exhibit significant bending deformations. 
    The picture below shows the broken starboard visor lug plates with fractures 
    A3, A4, A7, A8:</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1194.jpg" width="277" height="424"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The failure of the 
    visor hinges occurred by fractures A1-A8 of the visor lug plates together 
    with the fillet welds to the support bushings. The bolts had been ripped out 
    of the hinges, together with the bushings.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The four visor 
    lug plates revealed various amounts of macroscopic deformation and necking 
    at the fracture locations.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures 
    A1-A4 of the upper locations of the remaining bores were indicating considerable 
    less necking as compared to the lower fractures A5-A8. In particular, the 
    upper fractures A3,A4 of the starboard lugs exhibited only very small fracture 
    edge contractions, yielding substantially identical cross sections of the 
    fractures and the plates as taken from the design drawing. Fracture A4, shows 
    delaminations originating from longitudinally to rolling direction orientated 
    inclusions.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The respective 
    upper fractures of the port side lugs A1, A2 showed visible necking with some 
    reduction of local cross sections. the lower fracture of the outer port side 
    lug A5, was considerable necked representing a typical shear failure.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The lower fractures 
    A6 of both the inner port side and the outer starboard lug A8 were heavily 
    deformed by bending and hammering. As a particular feature, the inner starboard 
    upper fracture A3, was accompanied by numerous secondary cracks. Some of them 
    even penetrated the lug plate in radial direction without significant macroscopic 
    deformation.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The visual 
    investigation of the failed fillet welds between the hinge lugs and the support 
    bushings revealed different cracking modes at the upper and lower fractures 
    of the hinge plates. Close to the upper hinge lug plate fractures, A1-A4, 
    the fillet welds had failed mostly by cracks parallel to either the hinge 
    or the bushing surface.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The cracks 
    propagated also very often below the respective base material surfaces. At 
    the lower fracture areas of the hinge plates A5-A8, the fillet welds seemed 
    to have failed more by a shear fracture of the weld metal, revealing thicknesses 
    between 5 and 7 mm. However, there were also hammering effects on the weld 
    crack surfaces in this area which was more subjected to compression than to 
    tensile stress. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One bushing 
    had been recovered from the wreck while the remaining visor hinge lug plates 
    had been removed from the visor for investigation at the Institut för H&aring;llfasthetslära 
    of KTH, Stockholm. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fractures 
    and cracks of the upper locations A1-A4 of both the starboard and port side 
    hinge lug plates exhibit ratchet marks and fatigue bench marks which demonstrate 
    the start of fatigue cracking from flame cutting marks in the inner bore of 
    the lugs. This applies also to the lower fracture of the inner starboard lug, 
    A8. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For further 
    identification of the cracking mechanism, a section was removed from the inner 
    starboard upper fracture A3 area containing the above mentioned secondary 
    cracks. As from the metallographic investigation, fig. 46, the cracks developed 
    stepwise and showed side branching with corrosion products being typical for 
    corrosion supported cracking.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The investigation 
    of one of the secondary cracks (A3) revealed numerous smaller secondary cracks 
    also starting from the inner asymmetrically applied deep flame cuts. The formation 
    of respective ratchet marks can be clearly demonstrated at the crack initiation 
    points, which show successive striation marks at various locations of the 
    secondary cracks being created by stepwise crack propagation in radial direction 
    of the visor hinges.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fatigue 
    cracks of the visor hinge plates did however also initiate from the outer 
    surface of the hinge plates. The inner bore holes of the hinge plates were 
    originally drilled by machining, however, the surfaces visible outside of 
    these areas were noted as having been destroyed by inadequate application 
    of flame cutting.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The fracture 
    of the recovered hinge bushing was fitting to the fracture of the inner starboard 
    hinge lug. It exhibits a gap of about 4-6 mm between lug bore and support 
    bushing. This gap is almost entirely filled with corrosion products, presumably 
    magnetite, which is also found in thick layers at a location where both hinge 
    late and fillet weld failure are represented together with some excess weld 
    metal, see arrow on the picture below which may have provided a local notch 
    effect.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1197.jpg" width="308" height="244"></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In another cross 
    section, also severe corrosion inside the gap is identified and the surface 
    of the hinge bore and the bushing exhibit a considerable misalignment, which, 
    during welding of the left fillet weld, was overcome by a buffering layer. 
    The misalignment corresponds to asymmetric burning marks, for example of the 
    inner starboard hinge.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For closer 
    investigation only a small part of an adhering fillet weld of the support 
    bushing was available. It included both a full crack of the hinge plate material 
    and a secondary crack close to the weld metal and showed also the flame cut 
    surface of the hinge plate bore hole. While the full crack revealed plastic 
    shear at its flanks, the secondary crack had started from the heat affected 
    flame cut surface and propagated close to the heat affected zone of the weld 
    in radial direction. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Based on the 
    evidence provided by the above investigation, the following conclusions can 
    be drawn:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The fillet welds 
      between the hinge plates and the bushings seem to have partially failed 
      a considerable time before the casualty due to corrosion supported fatigue.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The partial 
      failure of these fillet welds provided access of seawater to the gap between 
      the hinge plates and the bushings and caused reduction of load carrying 
      capacity of the hinges. <br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Both effects 
      facilitated the start and propagation of extensive corrosion fatigue cracking 
      of the hinge plates at another location which occurred also a considerable 
      time before the casualty as demonstrated by the corroded appearance of the 
      fracture of the inner starboard hinge.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- It has 
      to be assumed that the inner starboard hinge may have failed first with 
      only a small macroscopic plastic deformation at the edges of the fracture 
      and without leaving bending of the rest of the hinge plate.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- As the 
      port inner hinge plate was found to be bent to port and plastic necking 
      at the fracture was noted, it has to be assumed that the port hinges failed 
      after the starboard hinges. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The above explained 
    investigation of the various parts of the ESTONIA visor system has provided 
    sufficient evidence that the visor hinges, in particular, the starboard hinge 
    lugs, were severely precracked, before the casualty. There is also evidence 
    that the fillet welds between the visor hinge lugs and the support bushings 
    failed due to corrosion assisted fatigue.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In order to 
    determine the required strength assessments, a Finite Element Calculation 
    of the stresses in the above welds was carried out which considered four different 
    directions of loads on the hinge lugs and established the location of the 
    maximum fracture inducing radial stresses in the fillet welds for each direction 
    and for various applied loads. The thickness of the fillet welds were taken 
    as 7 mm.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">For example, 
    the normal visor opening procedure created a vertical down force of maximum 
    375 kN on each hinge lug based on nominal visor weight and respective leverages 
    and resulted in maximum radial stress in the fillet weld found at the location 
    as marked by the circle in the drawing below together with the stress distribution 
    in radial direction. Accordingly the opening procedure would thus create a 
    local radial weld joint stress of 75 N/mm². </font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%204/pg1199.jpg" width="465" height="352"> 
    </font> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">It is thus obvious 
    that, during opening of the visor, the location of maximum radial fillet weld 
    stress is found in the same region where fatigue cracking of those fillet 
    welds initiated. However, also the other assumed directions of loads on the 
    visor hinges would provide maximum radial stress locations. In particular, 
    a similar stress range as for the opening procedure would result from an assumed 
    aftwards force on the hinges. Such an aftwards load could have created the 
    conditions for crack initiation and failure of the hinge plates, following 
    the failure of the fillet.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">From the present 
    investigation the following conclusions are drawn: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The ESTONIA bow 
      visor system contained considerable amounts of fatigue cracking which was 
      created by dynamic loads during normal service. The visor hinges showed 
      the largest amount of pre-damage, together with the mountings of the hydraulic 
      actuators.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure 
      of the bow visor hinges was initiated by failure of the fillet welds which 
      were vital supporting joints between the visor hinge plates and the supporting 
      bushings.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The failure 
      of the hinge fillet welds at locations of high stress was initiated by corrosion 
      fatigue a considerable time before the casualty.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The dynamically 
      loaded hinge plates failed by fatigue cracking and subsequent plastic overloading 
      of the remaining weakened cross sections. The fatigue crack initiation at 
      the hinge plates was favourised by corrosion, reduced load-carrying capacity 
      and burning marks.<br>
      </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- In addition 
      to the visor hinges and the actuator mountings, there were various other 
      pre-damaged locations, in particular, the stempost and the bottom lock area, 
      which may have contributed to overloading of the hinge locations. </font></p>
