  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In addition, Henrik 
    Sillaste had made various statements to journalists, viz.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - The first one 
    was published already on 28.09.94 at 15.57 hours Finnish time: <i>»According 
    to an Estonian machine operator,<b> Henrik Sillaste</b>, who managed to escape 
    from the ship through a funnel, the <b>gate of the car deck was for some reason 
    left slightly open and water came to the deck through it.</b> The body of 
    water, weighing many tons, that got inside the ferry made it very unstable, 
    and the wind and the size of the waves (according to the reports as high as 
    10 metres) were enough to push the ship to its side.«</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - On 29.09.94 the 
    following was published in a Helsinki newspaper:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Motorman <b>Henrik 
    Sillaste</b> (25), translation:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Soon after 
      midnight "Estonia's" forepart sunk heavily. I watched the car deck via the 
      video control system and saw <b>that water rushed in through the bow door, 
      which earlier has had problems</b>. At this moment the water already stood 
      knee-deep on the car deck. Thereafter "Estonia" rapidly listed over. The 
      2 main engines stopped soon thereafter, but the auxiliary engines were still 
      running.«</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Sillaste has maintained 
    this observation, viz. that the bow ramp was slightly open when he looked 
    at the monitor for the first time in the Engine Control Room (ECR), during 
    all his statements. Although he is expressing himself very carefully and has, 
    after the first three statements taken on 28/29 September 1994 at Turku, obviously 
    been prepared for possible further questioning concerning the visor and its 
    locking devices, however, apparently not in respect of the bow ramp. Also 
    the fact that he was not invited to attend the Landvetter meeting at the end 
    of March 1995 indicates that neither JAIC nor ESCO did consider him to be 
    a key witness. This apparently changed after this 'Group of Experts' had presented 
    his detailed evidence, including the drawing he had made showing the slightly 
    open bow ramp with water pressing through at both sides, to JAIC in the course 
    of the joint meetings held during the second half of 1995.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Already in January 
    1996 he was again interrogated by the Estonian security police when he made 
    another drawing showing the same condition of the slightly open bow ramp with 
    water pressing through at both sides. Both drawings are shown below.</font></p>

    Sillaste has testified concerning his relevant observations:<br>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- ca. 00.30 hours 
    was called by 3rd engineer Treu to come down to repair the vacuum system;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - went down in the 
    foreship to 0-deck to find out the cause for the problem;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - felt several hard 
    shocks in the hull which he considered to result from wave impact although 
    they were quite heavy;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he had found the 
    cause of the problem when the vessel heeled to starboard;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he went to the 
    engine control room (ECR) where Treu and motorman Kadak were;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - looked on the 
    monitor which showed forward, aft and both sides of the car deck;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw water penetrating 
    the forward part through the bow ramp, water penetrated in large quantities 
    at both sides of the ramp and we were discussing whether the visor had been 
    lost; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- <b>there was so 
    much water penetrating that it could not just be a question of damage to the 
    packings, water was streaming in all the time, not just when the bow was diving 
    into a wave;</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the vessel heeled<b> 
    then 30°-40°</b> and the main engines stopped one after the other;</font></p>

    <b>deck 6 the auxiliaries stopped</b>, the electricity went off and returned 
    after some seconds after the emergency generator had started;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>Treu had informed 
    the bridge that water was entering the vessel and that the bilge pumps were 
    running and pumping out water;</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - it took 15-20 
    minutes from the moment he saw water entering the car deck to the sinking 
    of the ferry. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>(3) on 29.09.94</b>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- ca. 00.30 hours</b> 
    called down to 0-deck due to the alarm system being out of function;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - went down to 0-deck 
    in the engine room area and found the cause to be lack of vacuum;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - started to work 
    and believes it took him <b>ca. 20-25 minutes</b> to find that out while the 
    vessel was labouring and shaking quite heavily in the sea state;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - when he was just 
    about to establish the cause for the vacuum, he felt<b> 2-3 really heavy shocks 
    in the hull</b> and the panel installation began to shake on the spring suspension;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>then the vessel

    left his cabin for the engine room;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - was told that 
    the control lights of the vacuum system indicated problems and he worked on 
    it for 15-25 minutes when he heard a hard bang which was not caused by wave

    </b>- Interview by Phillip Wearne:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - there were <b>3 
    strong blows, following one after the other but much quicker than wave blows 
    do and which were different to wave blows;</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after the 3rd

    and he knew that something must be wrong;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - rushed towards 
    the ECR;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>looked at the 
    monitor and saw water rushing in at both sides of the bow ramp,</b> the first 
    thought was that something was wrong with visor and bow ramp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>then 2 of the 
    4 main engines had already stopped</b>, then there was an attempt to pump 
    the ballast but this was a failure;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - <b>the heel increased 
    continuously clicking like the second hand of a wrist</b> watch;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - next also the 
    other 2 main engines stopped while the auxiliaries continued to run;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- tried to contact 
    the chief engineer but telephone had fallen down;</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - just before 
    the auxiliaries shut off there was the "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2" message 
    followed by the general alarm;</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he refers to what 
    he said right after the accident, he might mix up things now;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - when they were 
    between the 4th/6th deck the electricity went off and 2-3 seconds later the 
    emergency generator started to work and they continued to deck 8, had problems 
    opening the door at the port side because the heel was already some 70° and 
    it was above their heads, managed finally to open the door by pressing their 
    backs against it;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the emergency 
    exit was well constructed by the yard, it was quite narrow, thus they could 
    lean with their backs against the left wall and climb all the way up, if it 
    had been wider, they would have just fallen down;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - saw 2nd/3rd mates 
    leaving the bridge after the Tyfon signal - did not see them again;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>- ran (after 
    the heel) through the auxiliary engine room, the storage room, main engine 
    room and in these 4 rooms there was no water.</b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary of Henrik 
    Sillaste's various statements the following has to be concluded:<br>
    Due to his observations and respective statements Henrik Sillaste is one of 
    the key witnesses of the case. His statement: <i><b>"that the bow ramp was 
    only slightly open at a time when the vessel had already heeled abruptly to 
    starboard"</b></i> is crucial for the cause consideration, because obviously 
    the big heel had not been caused<i> "by large quantities of water flooding 
    onto car deck through the bow ramp having been pulled open by the forward 
    tumbling visor" </i>as alleged by the JAIC.<br>
    Also his timing was quite good in the first statements but was changed possibly 
    as consequence of influence of his principals, as evidenced by his statement 
    taken by the Estonian security police on 04.10.1994. <br>
    <b>As a matter of fact, it was Henrik Sillaste who told a member of this 'Group 
    of Experts' in March 1995 that all the crew survivors had been threatened 
    to be immediately sacked by ESCO if they said anything against ESCO's interests 
    to Commission members, journalists or other interested parties and this had 
    scared all the of the crew survivors considerably.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Nevertheless, 
    in addition to the aforementioned statements about the slightly open bow ramp 
    he has made a number of interesting remarks: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>- The lifeboat 
    lashings had been released in advance, which means that the vessel's command 
    had been aware for some time before the big heel at 01.02 hours that the ferry 
    was in danger of sinking. </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- The heavy impacts 
    - three in total, of which not everyone had felt the first one, but which 
    he had, having been so close - were not caused by waves</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - When he came to 
    the ECR two of the four main engines had already stopped, i.e. at ca. 01.03/04 
    hours, and the other two followed shortly afterwards, the watertight doors 
    were closed and the bilge pumps were running. (Since bilge pumps can only 
    pump from sections below the car deck, i.e. 1st deck or 0-deck, they must 
    have pumped from one or both of these decks.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He could not phone 
    the chief engineer since the telephone had fallen down which - according to 
    Treu - also the monitor showing the bow ramp had done at some stage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - He and Kadak left 
    the ECR upstairs already after having been there for only 5 minutes. Then 
    all four main engines had stopped already, but the diesel generators were 
    still running, possibly for another 1 or 2 minutes. This means that the main 
    engines had stopped already at about 01.10 hours or earlier and the diesel 
    generators stopped at about 01.12 hours, whereafter the emergency generator 
    in the funnel had started automatically, which among other things was also 
    supplying power to the bilge pumps. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- Just before the 
    diesel generators stopped he heard the<i> "Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2"</i> 
    alarm, which consequently must have been at about 01.10/01.11 hours. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The testimony of 
    Henrik Sillaste further proves that the visor was full of water and remained 
    full, respectively refilled time and again,<b> because water continued to 
    stream on to the car deck no matter whether the bow was diving into waves 
    or not.<br>
    </b></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The apparent 
    fact that there was something wrong with the vacuum system at about 00.30 
    hours is confirmed by the statement of Anneli Konrad, one of the dancing girls, 
    who has testified, inter alia:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>"At about 00.30 
      hours my performance was over and I was on my way to my cabin. I went wrong 
      and ended up on the 2nd car deck where I heard a crash. I found my cabin 
      finally feeling very sick. There was no water in the toilet."</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The complete statement 
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.4.283.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 21.2.4.283.</a></font></p>
