  Observations on Board</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">Since no information 
    about the operating history of the vessel was made available by owners/managers 
    and also the Final Report of the JAIC contains very little in this respect, 
    members of this 'Group of Experts' have spoken to previous passengers, advisers 
    and crew members in order to find out how ESTONIA and her crew did perform 
    during the 20 months in service under Estonian flag. Further information has 
    come from viewers of the Swedish TV program 'EFTERLYS' after the ESTONIA casualty 
    had been presented and viewers were requested to report about their own experiences 
    on board the ESTONIA, which about 40 viewers did. The reports submitted during 
    or immediately after the program - attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.145.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 12.4.145</a> - were analysed and the witnesses assumed to have made 
    relevant observations were contacted by a Swedish speaking expert of this 
    'Group of Experts' either personally or by phone. The results are summarised 
    in two faxes from Oy Mariner's Assistance Ltd. Ab, Helsinki to Marine Claims 
    Partner (Germany) GmbH, Hamburg dated 30.07.97 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.146.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.146</a> and dated 12.08.97 - <a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.147.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    12.4.147</a>. The results of all observations made on ESTONIA and which are 
    available to this 'Group of Experts' are summarised below.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">One 
    of the viewers of the 'EFTERLYS' program reported that he saw the ESTONIA 
    in July 1994 at her berth in Stockholm with open visor and open bow ramp, 
    which was categorically denied by N&T, ESCO and the JAIC members. </font></p>

  Heavy weather, excessive speed and banging noises</b></font></p>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"> <b>Martin 
    Jakobsson</b> - ESTONIA always maintained high speed, irrespective of the 
    weather circumstances. MARIELLA could always be seen at a relatively short 
    distance, but not on the last voyage.</font></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Li Iker</b> 
    - travelled on board ESTONIA three weeks before the casualty. The ferry proceeded 
    at rather high speed. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The weather 
    had deteriorated and the wind was blowing quite hard, the vessel was rolling 
    violently and smashed into the seas to the effect that there were bangs in 
    the hull. The witness felt uneasy and was unable to sleep, the rolling of 
    the ferry made it almost impossible to lie in bed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Jan-du-Rietz</b> 
    - retired captain, ca. 70 years old.</font> <br>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">He made 4 trips on 
    the ESTONIA, the last one was in May 1994. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">When he saw 
    on board the ESTONIA how the ship was being run he realised that the crew 
    still had to learn a lot. No doubt the master was under pressure but this 
    is no reason to push the vessel so hard against heavy head seas. The interview 
    is attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/12.4.148.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Next a letter shall 
    be quoted which the retired Captain Joel Haukka wrote on 2 February 1996 to 
    his old mate Captain Hans Rosengren, lecturer at the Nautical Academy Kalmar 
    and a member of the Swedish part of the JAIC:</font> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»I have made, 
        at least, 20-25 voyages on the ESTONIA and was, at least, 3 times on the 
        bridge.<br>
        </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">I 
        am sending you the Swedish translation of an interview with Andi Meister 
        published in the Estonian newspaper 'Postimees' on 16 January 1996.<br>
        Read the article and draw your own conclusions.<br>
        For me, having read his statement, it is a further confirmation that the 
        guy doesn't know what he is talking about.<br>
        He made it quite clear that the causes of the catastrophe are exclusively 
        technical. <br>
        Why is the excessive speed not taken into account?<br>
        In interviews and statement by the Estonian members of the JAIC it is 
        said that the speed is of no relevance and had no effect on the catastrophe.<br>
        The chairman of the Commission has furthermore given wrong information 
        in the interview when he stated that during the voyage there would be 
        nobody on the car deck.The crew went safety rounds on the car deck. <br>
        At the same time I am asking the question, after having read in the interview 
        about all the deficiencies that had been on the vessel, why were these 
        obvious deficiencies not rectified when the vessel changed flags to Estonia? 
        <br>
        The vessel was for a longer time sailing under Estonian flag and it should 
        very well have been noted that the ramp was at the wrong place. <br>
        Or didn't they have competent masters and superintendents who were able 
        to find that out?<br>
        According to the Estonian newspapers one of the conclusions in the Final 
        Report shall be that the speed had no relevance for the catastrophe, which 
        is totally wrong and not understandable because the vessel was proceeding 
        with full engine power against a full storm. Many people, who do not even 
        have own experience with good seamanship, will laugh about it. Already 
        in the autumn (1995) the public has pointed to the fact that the Estonian 
        Commission is biased. This is true, but the required consequences have 
        not been taken.<br>
        The Commission itself does everything to make the Final Report, which 
        is of substantial international interest, a farce, which is absolutely 
        impossible.<br>
        Forsberg did indeed state in yesterday's 'Svenska Dagbladet' that the 
        survivors had been questioned by the police. I am asking you, Hans: Is 
        it possible for an external, who has never had to do with shipping or 
        with how to handle a vessel, to ask the proper questions to establish 
        a correct picture (scenario) of what had happened?«</font></i></p>

    Estonian truck drivers before and after the casualty that cargo had shifted 
    inside the trucks to forward, which they attributed to the excessive speed 
    of the vessel trying to keep to the schedule. When they complained to crew 
    members about the damage caused, the answer had always been that Estline was 
    proud of beating Silja and Viking in bad weather. <br>

    21/22 April 1993. She wrote to Sjöfartsverket already on the 28 September

        was on the 4th deck, port side, forward and was overlooking the forecastle 
        deck. I went to bed at 11.30 hours Estonian time. The waves were coming 
        over the bow visor and were smashing with remarkable force against my 
        cabin window. Each time the vessel was diving into a wave-trough there 
        was banging - metal on metal - and I had the feeling that the visor was 
        loose. It was impossible to sleep, so I got dressed and walked all around 
        the vessel and subsequently I went as deep as I could inside the vessel. 
        Down there I could also hear the banging, but it did not sound as dangerous. 
        I went back to my cabin where the banging noises were much louder and 
        frightening. I went back to the aft part of the vessel and found an empty 
        sofa, where I slept until the next morning.« </i> </font></p>

    in cabin 1064, i.e. below car deck (1st cabin at port side in the 4th compartment), 
    and could not sleep due to the continuous banging noises from forward. The 
    weather was not bad - WSW, ca. Bft. 3 - and the vessel was slightly pitching 
    and rolling. He heard the noises for several hours. The vessel passed Söderarm 
    at about 22.00 hours, whereafter the banging started and went on to about 
    02.00 hours. Petrov informed the JAIC accordingly on 15.03.95 and spoke to 
    this 'Group of Experts' on 03.04.95. </font></li>
