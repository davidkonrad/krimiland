  The Stabilisers</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">In January 
    1994 the ESTONIA was fitted with stabilisers of make Brown Brothers which 
    had allegedly been in operation at the time of the casualty. According to 
    3rd engineer Margus Treu, the fins should retract automatically at speeds 
    below 4 kn, therefore he does not believe that survivors could have seen the 
    port stabiliser still out when the vessel was already almost on the side - 
    see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.3.271.htm" target="_blank"> Enclosure 
    21.2.3.271</a> - Protocol of Landvetter meeting on 31.03.95.<br>
    </font></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In all 
    probability Margus Treu is right because only after proper questioning of 
    the survivors Pierre Thiger, Tony Spuhl and Mats Hillerström did it turn out 
    that what they believed to have been the stabiliser was much too much forward 
    to assume it could have been the stabiliser. They saw something big, partly 
    white, partly dark, vertically bigger than transverse, which was moving in/out 
    and/or up/down, very far forward, almost at the bow. They saw it still when 
    the vessel was on the side already. The statement of Pierre Thiger taken on 
    08.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.414 and the statement of Tony Spuhl 
    taken on 10.10.99 is attached as Enclosure 29.6.415. The statement of Mats 
    Hillerström is not yet available. The actual stabiliser, however, is installed 
    in a pocket behind the heeling tank on 0-dek level, i.e. about midships. When 
    the witnesses were informed accordingly they categorically denied having seen 
    anything moving in this area. This leads to the conclusion that the survivors 
    had seen the visor, then still hanging on the bow ramp with the bottom attached 
    to the forepeak deck and ice- knife of the bulbous bow.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This leaves 
    the trainee mate Einar Kukk who has stated - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/enc%202/21.2.1.251.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    21.2.1.251</a> - that the stern was down to the stabiliser fin level. But 
    he did not say that the fin was out. Therefore, it has to be assumed that 
    the survivors actually meant the visor when they mentioned the stabiliser 
    during the last stage before leaving the vessel.<br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In any event 
    the port stabiliser fin was found to be in its pocket during the ROV inspection 
    on 09/10.10.94 - see the images below. </font></p>

  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The starboard stabiliser 
    is not visible on the available footage - although the area was accessible 
    and frequently inspected by ROVs and divers - because the respective parts 
    in the available video films were deleted. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The only mention 
    of the starboard stabiliser is made in the Video Tape Log concerning Video 
    No. RW/SEMiI/EST/R/94/001 - General Subject: Mudline Depth Survey by ROV UF0316 
    - on 04.12.94 - the mudline video - where it is stated: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»51.58 - Follow 
    curve of hull at forward of <b>stabiliser</b> 1 mtr gap from hull to M/L (mudline) 
    straight through.« </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Due to the stated 
    depth of 80.7 m before and 81.8 m after the above entry, it has to be concluded 
    that it was the deep starboard side because above the port stabiliser there 
    is only about 50 m of water.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> If the stabiliser 
    should be there in its pocket, why did the JAIC then censor the video? Probably 
    it is not there because there have been and still are continuous rumours that 
    the starboard stabiliser had not been installed properly in January 1994 - 
    see Subchapter 12.5.5 - and ever since did malfunction from time to time and 
    consequently might have broken off on the night of the casualty due to a too 
    weak construction. In this connection the statement of the passenger from 
    the 1st deck, Bengt Nilsson, recently taken in Stockholm - see Enclosure 29.6.416 
    - is of relevance, because he explains the metallic crack-ing/breaking noises 
    heard by him when still lying in his bed as having come exactly from the direction 
    where the starboard stabiliser fin had been installed. This indicates that 
    the fin could have broken off. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Alternatively the 
    stabiliser fin could have broken off by the object sliding against the vessel's 
    starboard side by which the scraping noises were caused. The noise scenario 
    for Bengt Nilsson would have been the same. Therefore the video footage showing 
    the ROV inspection of the sea bottom was analysed and the following two images 
    were found which could show parts of the stabiliser fin. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The following image 
    is a single frame from a cut tape which vaguely shows something long on the 
    seabed which the Finnish Commission did not want the public to see in detail.</font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary it has 
    to be concluded that the <b>port stabiliser</b> in all probability moved into 
    its pocket when the speed dropped below 4 kn which had been the case already 
    before the big heel. It has further to be concluded that the object seen by 
    some of the survivors far forward on the port side, which was moving in/out 
    or up/down, was most likely the visor. These observations were still being 
    made when the vessel was already on her side, i.e. at 01.30 hours or later. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">As to the <b>starboard 
    stabiliser</b> there are strong indications that it broke off or was broken 
    off and is resting on the sea bottom now. In both cases a substantial water 
    ingress into the engine room - at least 2 watertight compart-ments were affected 
    - would have been the result for which there are also indications, because 
    Henrik Sillaste has testified that the bilge pumps were running and Margus 
    Treu has stated they were trying to pump water out of the ship. As it is not 
    possible to pump water from the car deck they can only have pumped from 1st 
    deck and 0-deck. </font></p>
