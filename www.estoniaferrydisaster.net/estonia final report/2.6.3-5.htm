  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> At the fore part 
    of the ramp 8 sloping flaps were fitted, which automatically extended when 
    the ramp was opening. Each sloping flap worked independently of the others 
    in order to compensate for heeling of the ship as long as the list did not 
    exceed 2°. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ramp was approximately 
    1.5 m longer than there was deck height available, thus was extending the 
    forecastle deck in closed position by that distance. This extension was enclosed 
    by the 'ramp house'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ramp was connected 
    to the vessel's A-deck by means of 4 hinges of which the 2 outer ones were 
    provided with spherical bearings and the 2 inner ones with bronze bushings. 
    The bolts were of stainless steel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ramp was closed 
    by the 2 hydraulic cylinders until the opening was only about 45 mm and the 
    dead centre had been exceeded, thereafter 1 hook at each side of the vessel 
    moved forward, engaged mating lugs at the upper end of the ramp and the ramp 
    was hydraulically pulled tight against the rubber packings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Then 4 conically 
    shaped securing bolts moved from vessel's side into mating pockets at the 
    ramp side, one after the other with audible noises. Once the bolts were fully 
    extended contact was made with magnetic limit switches, switched in series 
    which activated the green indicator light at the car deck control panel. This 
    means that the green light was only activated if all 4 bolts had contacted 
    the respective sensors. The 2 hooks and 4 locking bolts of the bow ramp were 
    activated by means of one lever only and the system functioned in such a way 
    that at first the hooks moved out and pulled the ramp tight against the rubber 
    packings and thereafter the side bolts, one after the other, were activated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The movements of 
    the locking hooks of the bow ramp (ramp hooks) are shown on a drawing attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.3.77.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.3.77</a>. 
    It reveals that the ramp has to be closed by the actuators until there is 
    an opening at the top of no more than 45 mm whereafter the locking hooks engage 
    the mating lugs of the ramp. The particular contour of the hooks was chosen 
    to ensure that when a force was applied a bending moment in the hooks became 
    imposed which pressed the hooks against the pins of the mating lugs, i.e. 
    the hooks could never spring off the pins. Only by plastic deformation after 
    respective load exposure could this locking mechanism fail. Calculations of 
    the hook by means of a FEM-model with contact elements between hook and pin 
    - see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.3.78.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.3.78</a> 
    (2) - revealed that plastic deformation commenced at a load of ca. 27 ts. 
    and a so-called "plastic hinge" was built up. In summary it might be concluded 
    that the failure-load of one ramp hook was in the range of ca. 30 ts., whilst 
    the breakloads of the ramp pockets for the securing bolts have been calculated 
    with ca. 15 ts. each. Consequently the total load required to break open the 
    intact and properly secured bow ramp would be in the range of 30 ts. x 2 = 
    60 ts. plus 15 ts. x 4 = 60 ts., thus in total = <b>about 120 ts</b>. The 
    weight of the empty visor is 55 ts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Around the ramp 
    opening rubber packings housed in flat bars welded to the bulkheads were arranged 
    which should have kept the closed ramp watertight (weathertight). </font></p>

  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b>The stern 
    ramps</b> were designed as grillages with 4 longitudinal and 5 transverse 
    webplated beams. The ramp platings were reinforced by rolled stiffeners. The 
    ramp dimensions were:</font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><font size="2">Length 
    = 6500 mm<br>
    Breadth = 5500 mm<br>
    Weight = 11.5 ts</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><font size="2">At the upper 
    part of each ramp 9 sloping flaps were fitted, which always remained extended, 
    also when the ramps were in closed position. Each sloping flap was 1.5 m long 
    and had an independent flexibility in order to compensate for heeling of the 
    ship as long as the list did not exceed 2°. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ramps were connected 
    to the vessel's A-deck by means of 4 hinges of which the 2 outer ones were 
    provided with spherical bearings and the 2 inner ones with bronze bushings. 
    The bolts were of stainless steel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The ramps were closed 
    by two hydraulic actuators each until the opening was only about 45 mm and 
    the dead centre had been exceeded, thereafter 1 hook at each side of the ramp 
    moved forward, engaged mating lugs at the upper end of the ramps and the ramps 
    were hydraulically pulled tight against the rubber packings. Then 3 steel 
    cams, extending the bulkheads to both sides of the ramps, moved - hydraulically 
    operated - underneath steel pads fitted at the sides of the ramp. Thereby 
    the ramps were pressed tight against the rubber packings fitted in steel bars 
    welded to the bulkheads around the ramp openings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The movements of

    open an intact and properly secured stern ramp would be in the range of 30 
    ts. x 2 = 60 ts. plus 15 ts. x 6 = 90 ts., thus in total = about 150 ts.</font></p>

  Passenger and pilot doors</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The vessel 
    was also fitted with 4 <b>passenger doors</b>, one each at the port - and 
    starboardsides of decks 4 and 5 in approximately midships position. The dimensions 
    were 2.5 x 2 m. Each passenger door was operated by an hydraulic cylinder 
    and a link system, so that the doors were opening parallel to the ship's side 
    and then moved aft. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Furthermore 1 pilot 
    door was installed each at the port - and starboard-side of the car deck slightly 
    aft of midships. These doors opened 90° towards the center line of the ship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The doors were locked 
    to the ship by 4 wedges each, which were compressing the rubber packings in 
    order to give a suitable sealing. The wedges were hydraulically operated.</font></p>
