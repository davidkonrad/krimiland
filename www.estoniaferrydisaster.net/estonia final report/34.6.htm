  <i>Investigation Report of Video Tapes Featuring the<br>
  Car/Passenger Ferry "Estonia"</i> by Disengage, Axminster/UK</b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">All the video tapes 
    available to this 'Group of Experts' showing the ESTONIA afloat and on the 
    bottom of the sea were supplied to Disengage/UK specialised in the evaluation 
    and interpretation of video tapes and the production of video images. The 
    aim of the investigation conducted by Disengage at the beginning was to assist 
    the explosive expert Mr. B. Braidwood in identifying possible explosion damage 
    to the vessel. This has been completed and now the aim has been to identify 
    the technical nature of the videos, provide fully detailed listings of the 
    content of the cassettes, provide still images of any items of possible interest 
    to the overall investigation and identify any anomalies in the content of 
    the cassettes including missing sections of tape and unidentified activity 
    of wreck site. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Thirteen cassettes 
    have been submitted to Disengage for analysis. Of these 13 cassettes 4 stem 
    from diver activity and 9 were filmed by remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs). 
    This includes 3 tapes that are duplicates. <br>
    </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">There are two 
    main differences between videos made by ROVs and videos made by divers.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The ROV videos 
    show data on screen during recording, including date, time, course, depth 
    and camera pitch angle. The ROVs are also generally well lit due to them carrying 
    more than one light to conduct filming.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The diver videos 
    carry no data on screen resulting in dates and times being estimated from 
    brief official documentation and on screen encounters with ROVs from which 
    information is available. The picture quality of the divers videos is also 
    hampered because of the poor lighting used on the head mounted cameras. The 
    single very bright light tends to bleach out the images which effect has been 
    worsened during the duplication process.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The investigation 
    into the cause for the excessive brightness and unclear, foggy pictures revealed 
    that the contractor Rockwater made the original master recordings of the underwater 
    survey on VHS cassettes in a PAL format, however, tests have shown that the 
    copies supplied have been played back and duplicated on PAL/SECAM machines 
    without the necessary converters in place. This has created the breakdown 
    in colour definition, excessive brightness and tracking problems making accurate 
    work with the video tapes very difficult and sometimes impossible. The contractor 
    Rockwater was further requested to explain why so many, and partly long, video 
    pauses had been made respectively long parts of the tapes were just flickering. 
    Their reply was that it is normal practice for cameras to continue recording, 
    for safety and continuity, throughout a survey whether it is conducted by 
    ROVs or divers which is especially relevant when an ROV such as the Sprint 
    unit is used, because it is only image platform with no other capacity than 
    the collection of stills and video. As out of 13 cassettes reviewed only 4 
    have no cuts (because they were most probably made for demonstration purposes) 
    it is quite obvious that these cuts do not fall into the responsibility of 
    the contractor Rockwater, but were made elsewhere. It has also become apparent 
    that the breaks basically occur in the same areas of the vessel, for example 
    the starboard shell plating in way of the 0-deck below the bridge and funnel. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Another concern 
    regarding the cuts in the footage is the relationship between the on screen 
    timing and the VHS time code. Most of the occasions when a tape cut takes 
    place the elapsed time on the ROV 'on screen clock' is greater than that on 
    the VHS cassettes when most of the cuts in the footage were made at the time 
    of duplication and not when the survey was taking place.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In summary Disengage 
    has made the following main findings:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there is evidence that 
    between these dates there has been movement of what would be expected to be 
    stationary items such as ropes and debris. This is most clear on the hawsers 
    to the port side of the bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> According to the 
    cassettes from the 2/10/94, 9/10/94 and the 2-4/12/94 there are occasions 
    when other activity is taking place on the wreck, visible by other ROV and 
    diver lights on footage. This activity is not covered in the available cassettes.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There are areas 
    on the vessel that have not been surveyed enough to be documented properly. 
    These areas are either missing from the footage due to cuts in the footage 
    or because of a lack of detailed investigation when the ROV or divers are 
    in the area.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> This refers in 
    particular to the starboard mudline, bow ramp hydraulic actuators and ramp 
    locking hooks, seabed debris and the car deck in general. On the occasions 
    when the ROV got to the starboard mudline the tape is cut between the funnel 
    and bridge or until the ROV arrives at the starboard rudder or moves to another 
    area on the hull away from the mudline.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bow ramp actuators 
    have both been bent and damaged, however the diver does not attempt to conduct 
    any kind of detailed investigation. Apart from a brief comment about the eye 
    on the end of the starboard actuator on tape B40c/number 19 there is no other 
    comment or video documentation of these important items.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It is possible 
    to access the car deck and on tape B40c/number 19 the diver enters it to inspect 
    the ramp securing bolts and mating pockets. On the respective video there 
    is remarkable damage briefly visible which is totally ignored by both the 
    diver and his supervisor and all the many others in the control room on board 
    of SEMI I who were watching what the diver was doing and frequently interfered 
    with instructions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For example, the 
    diver briefly looked onto a big damage to the port longitudinal car deck bulkhead 
    when he was climbing up the bottom flaps of the bow ramp from starboard to 
    port. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">On cassette B40b/number 
    20 the ROV attempts on several occasions to enter the car deck and fails. 
    On several of these occasions the operator believes he has entered the car 
    deck, but then discovers he's wrong and on the seabed. On the final occasion 
    they are sure they have entered and this is very difficult to confirm due 
    to several cuts in the tape, but on the later diver cassette B40e/number 10 
    from the same date and time the diver sees the ROV on the seabed at the same 
    time as this footage. Due to the large number of cuts on this ROV tape B40b/number 
    20, including one cut of nearly one hour, no conclusions can be made. There 
    is however some confusion in this ROVs activities as during the hour long 
    cut in the ROVs footage the diver sees the ROV active and inside the bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> From the limited 
    footage available from the seabed near the starboard bow of the vessel at 
    a depth of 91 m it is difficult to identify many of the pieces visible, however, 
    some wooden pallets with cement bags on can be seen as well as other debris. 
    This is made worse by the very regular cuts in the footage throughout the 
    time the ROVs are viewing the seabed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On cassette B40a/number 
    6 dated 4/12/94 the opening dialogue on both the screen and audio commentary 
    states that this is cassette two. Starting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and 
    featuring footage shot by the SPRINT ROV, no cassette has been received labelled 
    as number one or any timed recording before this time on this date.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a large 
    amount of repeat coverage of certain areas of the vessel without any new information, 
    procedure, agenda or evidence being discovered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On two of the cassettes 
    that have been supplied, the official tape logs that have been supplied as 
    documentation generated at the time of filming do not correspond with the 
    content of the video cassette.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> It has been confirmed 
    by the contractor used for the diver survey, Rockwater, that it is common 
    practice for divers to be equipped with two different earpieces to allow both 
    the dive supervisor and technical personnel to communicate with the diver. 
    It is apparent on the diver video B40c/ number 19 that the diver is receiving 
    instructions in another earpiece. It is unfortunate that these instructions 
    have apparently resulted in the missing of potentially important areas of 
    the vessel survey. There are no transcripts at all of any of these communications.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is evidence 
    indicating that there has been movement of the bow ramp at some point before 
    it came to rest in its current position. The evidence visible on the tapes 
    is the two hawsers trapped inside the car deck on the port side near the manual 
    side lock. The other evidence is on the starboard side where the visor actuator 
    has caused considerable damage on the front bulkhead, there is a large flap 
    of this metal caught between the ramp and the bulkhead and there is further 
    evidence on the starboard bulkhead recess in way of the blown up fastening 
    of the bow ramp actuator that the ramp had been opened/closed which it had 
    already been resting on the starboard bulkhead.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40c/number 
    19 the divers have cut some items from the bow and are taking them to the 
    crane for lifting, one diver is at the upper port side of the ramp and the 
    other is at the bottom starboard side of the ramp. The diver who is standing 
    on the starboard side bottom of the bow ramp near the hinge turns his head 
    twice towards the seabed. On both occasions another diver is visible on the 
    starboard side of the ramp below him, this diver is wearing different equipment 
    from the two divers already detailed and is not explained in any of the other 
    footage.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the divers 
    are in the area of the port bridge there is a large amount of damage on the 
    under side of the port wing of the bridge which was - at least to some extent 
    - already visible on the ROV video from 02.10.94 and the sheeting appears 
    to be torn off the underside of the bridge wing with heavy scoring marks on 
    the inner side of the vertical stanchion supporting the wing.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The lower outer 
    wire strengthened glass window of the backside of the port bridge wing was 
    also found to be broken trapping what appears to be a victim in the strengthening 
    wire still attached to the window. The diver first pulled the mash wire away 
    and then pulled the body out of the window and let it float away.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On tape B40d/number 
    9 the diver says that he is going to the seabed, but there is no tape showing 
    this part of the survey. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In the time and 
    date order of the cassettes, tape B40e/number 10 chronologically comes before 
    tape B40d/number 9.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> On the ROV survey 
    conducted in 1996/number 11 the tape is dated from the official source as 
    19/06/96 but it is cut so badly that it goes back in time by whole days to 
    the 09/06/96, 26/04/96, 17/06/96, 11/06/96 and contains still images from 
    a video pause during duplication.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Disengage reached 
    the following conclusions: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is a disturbing 
    lack of continuity in the cassettes due to the large number of tape cuts. 
    These tape cuts appear to have been made at different times and with different 
    levels of competence. The cuts vary between very clean, single frame cuts 
    with no interference on screen, to long pieces of interference and on several 
    occasions the contents not only change location but go back in time and date. 
    The worst example of this type of cut occurs on the most recent cassette from 
    1996 that jumps back in time nearly two months. Very few of the tape cuts 
    that have been documented in this report occur in locations where victims 
    could be or are located and they are not due to technical issues, leaving 
    no apparent reason for their existence. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The fact that the 
    tape cuts repeatedly occur in the same areas of the vessel on different cassettes 
    from different times and dates does not allow us to generate full documentation 
    of a very serious casualty. This is a particular concern as the areas that 
    lack documentation are very important to the investigation and include the 
    starboard mudline and car deck. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> There is wide range 
    of diver and ROV activity on and around the wreck site that is not detailed 
    in the available footage. The time comparisons detailed in this report illustrate 
    that the activity of some of the ROVs and divers visible on the tapes is not 
    documented in its own right due to lack of tapes or tape cuts. On several 
    occasions this undocumented activity is in areas where there is a lack of 
    overall documentation, including the car deck and bow ramp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Format problems 
    resulting in poor duplication and footage quality hamper independent investigation 
    of the official cassettes. The lack of format conversion during duplication 
    has resulted in a large drop in quality, combined with the tape cuts it has 
    meant that reaching conclusions from the tapes and still images has been far 
    more difficult, sometimes impossible. </font></li>
