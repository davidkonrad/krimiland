<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.3 Propulsion system and 
  control</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The propulsion system consisted 
  of four medium-speed diesel engines, connected in pairs to two propeller shafts 
  via gear boxes. The engines were four-stroke turbo-charged engines with eight 
  cylinders and a maximum continuous output of 4 400 kW each. They were designed 
  to operate on heavy fuel oil. Maximum continuous operating revolutions of the 
  engines were 600 rpm which corresponded to 188 rpm of the propellers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Each propeller shaft carried 
  one controllable-pitch propeller with a diameter of 4.0 m. The port-side propeller 
  rotated clockwise and the starboard side one counter-clockwise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The pitch control of the propellers 
  was hydraulic, separate for each propeller. The control was effected electrically 
  be power selector levers on the main control console on the bridge, on the bridge 
  wings and in the engine control room. The control signal from the power selector 
  affected the engine revolutions as well as the propeller pitch via an electro-hydraulic 
  "combinator". Revolutions and pitch both increased at increasing power settings 
  up to about 70% output, when the maximum continuous engine revolutions, i.e. 
  800 rpm were reached. After that, the output could be further increased to 90% 
  by increasing the propeller pitch only while the revolutions of the engines 
  remained at 600 rpm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">All the normal indicators, alarms 
  and control devices were on the bridge and in the engine control room. The installation 
  qualified for unmanned machinery space at sea in accordance with the classification 
  requirements, but actual operation was at all times conducted with the engine 
  control room manned by one engineer and one motorman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The total fuel oil tank capacity 
  was 940 m³ of heavy fuel oil and 291 m³ of marine diesel oil. Bunkering for 
  a complete round trip was always done in Stockholm. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.4 Electrical system</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The three-phase, 380 V, 50 
  Hz electrical system was fed by four main electrical generator sets. They had 
  an output of 1065 kVA each and were capable of parallel operation. The generators 
  were driven by four diesel engines, each supplying 1104 kW at 750 rpm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">Transformers provided 220 V 
  single-phase power for lighting and utility functions. The main electrical switchboard 
  was in the engine control room. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">An emergency generator set in 
  compliance with the SOLAS requirements was installed in a separate room on deck 
  8 near the engine casing. The generator was powered by a diesel engine with 
  an output of 312 kW at 1500 rpm. It supplied the emergency lighting system and 
  also essential bridge equipment, including engine control, steering system, 
  radars, gyro-compass, logs, echo-sounder, navigation lights, search lights, 
  radio station, telephone system and public address system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The emergency generator unit 
  was designed to start automatically in case of loss of electrical power in the 
  main network. The total starting and switch-in time was about 15 seconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Accumulators for emergency 
  power in case of loss of all other electrical supply were installed in compliance 
  with the SOLAS requirements. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.5 Ballast 
  system</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Two centrifugal 
  ballast pumps were installed, each with a capacity of 300 m³/h. The pumps served 
  ballast tanks which were the forepeak tank, the forward trim tank, two double-bottom 
  tanks, one pair of heeling tanks and the aft peak tank, giving a total capacity 
  of 1212 m³.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The heeling tanks 
  were side tanks with a capacity of 183 m³ each and intended for adjusting a 
  list of the vessel when needed. The list that could be compensated with one 
  heeling tank full and the other empty was about eight degrees. A separate heeling 
  tank pump could be operated from the deck office at the stern ramp and from 
  the engine control room. The connection valve between the heeling tanks (cross-flooding 
  valve) was designed to close in case of failure of electrical power. The open/close 
  condition of this valve was indicated by red/green lights on the control panel 
  for the watertight doors on the bridge. - See photo below. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.6 Car deck 
  arrangement</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The vessel had 
  a deck for loading trucks, cars and other wheeled cargo. The car deck was the 
  vessel's freeboard deck and identified as deck number 2. It extended from side 
  to side and from bow to stern, with a centre casing immediately starboard of 
  the centre line. The available deck space was divided into four lanes on the 
  port side and three on the starboard side. Lashing fittings were mounted along 
  the lanes on the car deck.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Personnel access 
  to the car deck was via stairs and lifts in the centre casing. Four of the lifts 
  had doors leading to the starboard side of the car deck and one had doors to 
  the port side. A total of eleven doors, six starboard and five port, led from 
  the car deck to the stairs inside the casing. The doors were sliding-type steel 
  doors, meeting the SOLAS fire resistance requirements. The locks of the doors 
  were remotely operated from the Information desk on deck 5. The doors were not 
  locked at sea. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The car deck space 
  was ventilated by electrically driven fans, located on both sides at the forward 
  and aft ends of the deck area. The air channels ended at the open deck 4, on 
  the forecastle deck level in the front bulkhead of the superstructure.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Twelve closable 
  4" scuppers were installed along each side of the deck. The scuppers were normally 
  left open.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Four TV cameras 
  for monitoring the car deck area were mounted. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"><b>2.5.7 Bridge 
  layout</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The navigation 
  bridge was on the uppermost deck (deck 9), 9.2 m aft of the forward end of the 
  superstructure. The bridge wings extended over the ship's sides by about 1.5 
  m and were fully enclosed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The central part 
  of the bridge extended forward of the wings by about 2 m. In the original design 
  there was a console containing all major navigation and control equipment at 
  the front bulkhead, just below the windows. The steering console was located 
  on the centre line, just behind the front windows. The bridge was rebuilt in 
  January 1994 and some of the navigation equipment was renewed. The navigation 
  console at the front bulkhead was partly removed, and a new conning station 
  was installed to port of the centre-line. The design of the conning station 
  was of the Pilot-Copilot type, commonly used in Baltic ferries.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> The new console 
  contained two ARPA radars, DGP's (Differential Global Positioning System) receivers, 
  the main auto-pilot, propulsion control levers, VHF telephones, mobile telephones 
  and equipment for internal communications. From the two navigators' seats, and 
  the captain's seat, normally placed to the port of the conning console, the 
  panel with indicator lamps for visor and ramp was within sight.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The fin stabilisers 
  and associated controls were also installed in 1994. The original "Roll-Nix" 
  stabilisation system had been found inadequate. It was, however, not removed 
  and had sometimes been used in strong following wind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> A separate chartroom 
  was located on the starboard side, in the aft part of the bridge. The corresponding 
  space on the port side was an open area containing the fire alarm centre and 
  various cabinets for storage, etc. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman">The main entrance 
  to the bridge, from the accommodation, was on the centre line at the aft end 
  of the bridge, where a door to the staircase connected the bridge with the officer 
  and crew accommodation on decks 8 and 7. On the port side at the aft end of 
  the bridge there was a door to the open deck.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> Because of the 
  retracted position of the navigation bridge, only the flag pole on the bow of 
  the vessel was visible from the conning station - see drawing below - whilst 
  the most forward part of the visor could be seen through the two windows on 
  deck level at both sides of the extended central part of the bridge, as can 
  be seen on the drawing below. A monitor, showing among other things, the transmissions 
  from the four car-deck cameras, was placed at the chartroom entrance and could 
  not be seen from the conning station. </font></p>
