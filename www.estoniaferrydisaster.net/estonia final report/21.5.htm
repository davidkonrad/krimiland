  Summary of Observations and Noises Heard Before the Abrupt Heel</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b>1st Deck 
    </b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Silver Linde :</b> 
    He heard and felt only one crash when he was on the car deck, i.e. about 15 
    minutes before the heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Margus Treu : 
    </b>He heard and felt two or three impacts which were not caused by waves 
    and then the heel came.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Henrik Sillaste 
    :</b> He felt three impacts not caused by waves when he was working and then 
    the heel followed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Jaan Stern : </b>Immediately 
    before the heavy heel, what he thought were waves beating very hard against 
    the vessel, then silence and then the vessel fell on the side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Neemi Künno Kalk 
    :</b> Woke up from a loud rushing sound.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Ulla Marianne 
    Tenman :</b> Some time before the casualty heard several hard bangs and something 
    beating against something. Later (when she was up on the 7th deck) she heard 
    a heavy bang and the vessel heeled to starboard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Carl-Erik Reintamm 
    :</b> He suddenly heard two strong, strange noises, some-thing like scraping 
    noises which came from below (like ice scraping along the vessel's bottom), 
    shortly later the vessel fell on the side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Carl Övberg : 
    </b>He woke up suddenly from the strong noise of rushing water which he could 
    hear from both sides, but loudest from starboard side; these noises alarmed 
    him;</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - in addition 
      he heard quite strong metallic banging noises which definitely had not been 
      there before; he sat up in bed and put his feet on the floor, since the 
      bed was athwartships he was facing the door looking aft;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he lit a cigarette 
      and listened attentively to the strange and frightening noise scenario;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after a little 
      while he suddenly heard the starting up noise of an hydraulic pump or pumps 
      followed by the clicking of valves and then the typical noise created by 
      an hydraulic system under load;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - simultaneously 
      he heard the banging of sledge hammers or something like that;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- the noises came 
      probably from forward;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the hydraulic 
      under load noise faded away and came back again whilst the sledge-hammer 
      banging noise more or less continued. Both the hydraulic noise and the sledge-hammer 
      banging noise continued for ca. 10-15 minutes whilst the other banging noises, 
      then heard already for some 20-25 minutes, also continued;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the hydraulic 
      noise and the sledge-hammer noise stopped with a short, sharp metallic crash 
      which gave him the impression that something heavy, metallic had broken:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - after a 'silence' 
      of 30-40 seconds the next really extreme crash followed in connection with 
      an abrupt stopping of the ferry which was so 'sudden' that he was thrown 
      against the front wall of his bed; it was a short, sharp intense crash as 
      if the ship had struck against something or was struck by something;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he jumped out 
      of his bed and put his clothes on very quickly when he realised that all 
      the engine noises had stopped and that the ferry was now making much softer 
      pitch movements; </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">this 
      must have been at about 01.00 hours, ca. 1-2 minutes later the vessel heeled 
      very wide to starboard.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Holger Wachtmeister 
    :</b> Woke up by a scraping noise and a hard bang - the scraping noise continued 
    - left cabin and heel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Ain-Alar Juhanson 
    :</b> Woke up from heavy metallic bangs. Thereafter the vessel heeled to starboard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Martin Nilsson 
    :</b> Something was frequently heavily beating against the vessel; 10-15 minutes 
    before the big heel he heard scraping noises, i.e. cracking and scraping; 
    the strong scraping noise was continuously heard also while the big heel occurred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Jan Gustavsson 
    :<i> </i></b><i>"Now we have run aground."</i> So clear and distinct was the 
    noise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Daniel Svensson 
    : </b>At each pitch movement something was beating against the hull<i> "as 
    if somebody was hammering with a big stone".</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Jasmina Waidinger 
    :</b> Heard banging noises which were abnormal, then she heard a rushing sound 
    (water), then heard strong noise above her like something big and strong moving 
    from one place to another; next came the heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Bengt Nilsson 
    : </b>Could not sleep because of something frequently beat-ing very heavily 
    against the hull. Later heard roaring squeaking, shrieking and scraping followed 
    by a metallic breaking noise from starboard aft. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Ants Nadar : </b>Woke 
    up due to hard banging noises. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Andrus Maidre 
    : </b>Just before the heel metallic scraping noises and the moving/falling 
    of a heavy object; - just before the heel he heard crashing and banging noises, 
    something like a truck toppling over. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Tambet Herbert 
    Lausma : </b>Woke up from loud rumbling noises.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Ints Klavins 
    : </b>Woke up from a dangerous (evil) noise, such as metal scraping against 
    the bottom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Gennadi M. Pärson 
    :</b> Heard an unusual, strange noise - had the impression that something 
    like a barrel was rolling against something.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Dainis Sleiners 
    : </b>Heard low indefinable, strange noises before the heavy bang which woke 
    him up completely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>N. Andrejev :</b> 
    Felt extremely hard bang and was thrown against the cabin wall before he was 
    thrown out of his bed due to the big heel; he was unable to identify from 
    where the bang had come, but it felt as if the vessel had collided with something 
    and at the same time came the excessive heel. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Deck 4</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Anders Ericson 
    :</b> Ca. 01.00 hours suddenly heard two heavy bangs, one straight after the 
    other which came from nearby his cabin.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Einar Kukk :</b> 
    Heard a strange noise which was very unusual and alarming to him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Mikael Öun : 
    </b>- Heard continuous banging noises for a long time;</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - heard 2-3 severe 
      scraping noises;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - heard a particularly 
      loud bang;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - heard 3 heavy 
      scraping noises from forward, one after the other and the heel followed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Eckard Klug : 
    </b>Heard many bangs which he had never heard before; then heard one extremely 
    heavy bang, so heavy like breaking of a thick steel plate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Tony Spuhl :</b> 
    Heard an enormous crash and the whole vessel was shaking/vibrating;</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> then 2 metallic 
      noises - klonk - klonk - directly after the bow was setting into the waves; 
      then the same noise 3 times, then a rushing noise below his cabin which 
      came from the car deck;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> heard the rushing 
      sound once more and big heel. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Morten Boje Jensen 
    : </b>Heard continuous "small banging noises", then 3 bangs, one after the 
    other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Anneli Konrad 
    :</b> Woke up from a crash and the vessel's shaking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Wanda Wachtmeister:</b> 
    Could not sleep and suddenly heard one crash or loud bang, a heavy loud noise 
    of the type that made you realise that something is wrong. It came from the 
    bottom of the vessel - a clear distinct "boom" - not rattle. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Marek Kaasik :</b> 
    Heard metallic noises from the upper decks, then the vessel's whole construction 
    was shaking and then the heeling occurred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Magnus Lindström 
    :</b> At midnight he heard strange noises which came from the car deck, something 
    was rolling over the car deck; then he heard one heavy bang and the vessel 
    heeled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Kerim Nisancioglu 
    :</b> The vessel began to roll equally in the waves from side to side and 
    he assumed that the seas did not come anymore from ahead, he did not feel 
    the engine, in connection with the rolling the vessel heeled to starboard 
    and he heard something sliding over to starboard below them - some large object 
    - then came the heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Hannu Seppänen 
    :</b> Sometime just after midnight he felt an unusual shaking/vibrating in 
    the vessel's hull and a little later came the heel.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Deck 5: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Birgit Eriksson 
    :</b> Woke up by noises indicating that steel was knocking against steel almost 
    immediately followed by the heavy heel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Leif Bogren :</b> 
    Heard at about 00.40/45 hours for the first time the unusual bom-bom noises, 
    which repeated, next came an enormous VROM-BOOM followed by a CRASH and the 
    engines stopped - ca. 1 minute later starboard heel; subsequently Bogren gave 
    an additional explanation: - the sound was like somebody beating with a sledge 
    hammer against vessel's hull; - he noticed the noise three times within 2 
    minutes, - the noises came from forward port side and below.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Pierre Thiger 
    :</b> 15 minutes before midnight (Swedish time) when he heard 3 bangs with 
    15-20 seconds in between, metal to metal and thought it was a collision, the 
    ship was shaking and vibrating differently than before, shortly afterwards 
    he noted that she was pitching more, but made much slower and deeper movements, 
    there were no more bangs but suddenly he felt vibrations in the aft ship which 
    made him think that they had turned the stern into the sea and the pitch was 
    on astern, he could not see anything out of the window, he felt the vibrations 
    from the propeller (glasses were clinking) and then he heard the strange noise: 
    A very low noise and simultaneously the pitch movements stopped as if a wave 
    had struck under the stern, then all vibrations stopped and in the same second 
    she continued to pitch again, however, without any noise (i.e. with 0-pitch 
    or stopped engine), for about one minute she was only pitching, then pitching 
    and rolling, and then only rolling - she made two full swings - more to starboard, 
    less to port, and the third time she heeled over deep to starboard, did not 
    right up again and then fell abruptly to about 40°/45°, this was just before 
    midnight (Swedish time) and came almost back to upright position. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Deck 6: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Per-Erik Ehrnsten 
    </b>: - Tried to sleep, but was kept awake by hard noises created by the ferry 
    slamming into high seas, however what kept him awake, in particular, were 
    the indefinable shocks, which deviated from the normal noises of the ferry,</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the shocks and 
      the noises repeated themselves indefinably, regularly 4-5 times. "Tong-tong, 
      tong, tong"; noise, short pause and the same again,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - he got up and 
      started to dress when the ferry suddenly heeled to starboard and the furniture 
      was sliding against the door,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the mentioned 
      noise came from below and from forward,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - the noise was 
      not caused by the sea and also was not a sudden sound like an explosion 
      but it was regular, each unit - tong, tong, was equally strong, a little 
      pause and the same regularity,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - it was no impact 
      noise (collision, grounding).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Marianne Ehn 
    :</b> Lots of noises in the vessel woke her up, she asked her husband for 
    the time and it was 00.00 hours (Swedish time);</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> - something was 
      beating heavily against the vessel; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">- shortly afterwards 
      the vessel was diving into a deep wave trough, there was a heavy bang - 
      the vessel heeled severely and the engines stopped.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Mihai Turdeau 
    :</b> In the casino he suddenly heard a strong metallic noise followed by 
    3-4 bangs one after the other which appeared to come from down below - heel.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Deck 7:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Peeter Tüür (2nd 
    engineer)</b> : Heard metallic bangs apparently caused by objects hitting 
    against each other. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Andres Verro (reefer 
    engineer)</b> : Heard strange metallic noises. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Aarne Koppel (car 
    deck worker)</b> : Heard a low breaking sound. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Elmar Siegel (motorman)</b> 
    : 3-5 minutes before the heel he heard noises like someone beating against 
    the vessel's hull with a large hammer - it sounded as if the vessel had hit 
    something with the bow. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Andres Vihmar 
    (purser)</b> : Heard - what he believed were heavy seas - beating against 
    the vessel's bow.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><b>In summary of 
    the above it can be concluded, that </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(a) the noises heard 
    and observations made by the survivors depend on the deck they were on and 
    whether they were forward or more aft on that deck; the survivors from decks 
    1 and 4 (forward part) having been closest to the action heard more and more 
    detailed noise scenarios than those from decks 5 and 6; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">(b) there had been 
    heard low banging noises from the foreship area already during the evening 
    hours which had continued all the time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (c) some survivors 
    have noted that the vessel behaved differently at about midnight;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (d) all survivors 
    having testified in this respect had heard and felt either one - two - or 
    three major bangs, crashes combined with shaking/vibrating of the vessel shortly 
    before the big heel - even Ulla Marianne Tenman on the 7th deck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (e) since 10-15 
    minutes before the big heel some survivors from the 4th deck, but in particular 
    those from the 1st deck, heard very clear and distinct "scraping sounds" from 
    below, a noise which is heard when a vessel runs aground or proceeds through 
    ice. The noises continued even after the heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (f) about 15 minutes 
    before the heel, 3 sharp metallic bangs were heard with 15-20 seconds in between 
    and thereafter steel knocking against steel noises respectively metal against 
    metal noises or sledge-hammer noises or stone against the hull noises were 
    heard which ended in the 2 or 3 big crashes shortly before the heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (g) hydraulic noises 
    were heard by one possibly two passengers on the 1st deck, which were clearly 
    identified by one passenger and explained by the other to sound like roaring, 
    squeaking and shrieking and which were combined with the sledge-hammer noises 
    and ended together with them in the first of the two major crashes shortly 
    before the big heel;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (h) some survivors 
    from the 1st deck had heard rushing water sounds about 30 minutes before the 
    heel and later again, and then shortly before the heel also survivors from 
    the 4th deck heard sounds of rushing water from the car deck;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> (i) some survivors 
    from the 1st deck and 4th deck had heard something heavy and large "rolling 
    - moving" on the car deck to starboard before the big heel; </font></p>
