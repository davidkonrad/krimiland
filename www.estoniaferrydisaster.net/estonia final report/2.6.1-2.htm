<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2">The visor 
    and ramp installations of the ESTONIA were of a configuration common on ferries 
    in traffic between Finland and Sweden at the time of her construction. The 
    installations comprised an upward-opening bow visor and a loading ramp at 
    the bow and two loading ramps at the stern, which were hinged at car deck 
    level and closed when raised.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position, 
    the upper end of the bow ramp extended into a box-like housing on the deck 
    of the visor, the ramp house. The complete bow ramp and the operating and 
    locking devices for the visor as well as the stern ramps and the hanging decks 
    were designed and delivered by an independent company, von Tell Trading & 
    Co. AB, Gothenburg (hereafter called von Tell AB), an established supplier 
    of hydraulically operated ship's installations. The design was based on a 
    detailed specification by the shipyard. Von Tell AB used a subcontractor, 
    Grimmereds Verkstads AB, Gothenburg for manufacturing complete sets of components 
    for the ramps, the hanging decks and the locking devices, including those 
    for the visor. The routine contacts between the Yard and the supplier were 
    via von Tell GmbH, Hamburg, a subsidiary of von Tell AB. Incorporation of 
    the system into the ship and manufacture of the attachment structure were 
    shipyard work, although under the supervision of a von Tell representative. 
    See Subchapter 2.4.2. The equipment delivered by von Tell was identical to 
    that built for the preceding newbuilding, DIANA II, except for the slightly 
    increased length of the bow ramp and the changes of the car platforms dictated 
    by the greater length of the vessel. According to available information the 
    visor operating and locking system for DIANA II was designed by von Tell AB 
    staff who had experience with similar installations from their previous employments. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The Bureau Veritas 
    rules valid at the time had no details regarding procedures for calculating 
    sea loads on the bow visor. It was stated in general wording "that doors should 
    be firmly secured and that structural reinforcements should be made to attachment 
    points of cleats, hinges and jacks". The general wording in the rules also 
    specified that the scantlings for the visor structure should be equivalent 
    to that of the hull itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vertical and 
    longitudinal sea loads to which the bow visor could be exposed were calculated 
    separately by the Yard and by von Tell AB. The Bureau Veritas rules gave no 
    detailed guidance for such calculations. The Yard therefore used for this 
    purpose the nominal "pressure heights" given by Bureau Veritas in the Note 
    Documentaire BM2 of 05.04.1976, which was originally issued as a general guidance 
    for determining the loads on the bows of large ships, whilst von Tell AB used 
    nominal pressure heads per unit of projected area specified in the rules of 
    Lloyd's Register Shipping, valid at the time ESTONIA was under construction.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman"> <font size="2"><b>The Visor 
    Construction and Functioning</b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The vessel was a 
    Ro-Ro passenger ferry with visor, bow ramp and stern ramps. The visor was 
    the most forward part of the vessel and pivoted around 2 hinges fitted at 
    the forecastle deck, i.e. C-deck, having its opening and closing move-ments 
    performed by 2 hydraulic lifting cylinders (actuators). The construction of 
    the visor corresponded to the construction of the bow with material dimensioned 
    according to the general requirements of the Classification Society (for details 
    see Subchapter 2.4.3). The lower forward part was ice-strengthened. The visor 
    consisted mainly of shell plating being an extension of the ship's shell plating 
    and contour, the forecastle deck, the bottom part, the 2 aft bulkheads, the 
    3 horizontal stringers with the 5 bow pointers in between respectively on 
    top of the 2 vertical partial bulkheads and transverse stiffeners. The two 
    so-called visor arms (beams) extended about 3 m aft of the visor and ended 
    in the two hinge arrangements by which the visor was connected to the vessel 
    and which were the pivoting parts as well. The design weight of the visor 
    was about 55 mts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Between the two 
    visor arms a box-shaped housing - the so-called ramp house - was fitted into 
    which the upper end of the bow ramp extended in closed position. This was 
    the interlock between visor and bow ramp, a configuration quite common at 
    the time VIKING SALLY was designed and built (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.67.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.6.2.67</a> - photo VIKING SALLY). In closed position the visor 
    was connected to the foreship by three hydraulically operated locking devices. 
    One of these locking devices - the "Atlantic lock" - was mounted on the forepeak 
    deck - A-deck - whilst the other 2 were side locks mounted in the front bulkheads 
    of the vessel with the mating lugs at the lower parts of the aft bulkheads 
    of the visor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In addition, there 
    were 2 mechanical locking devices - the so-called manual side locks - mounted 
    on both sides below the hydraulic side locks. The manual side locks were - 
    according to Bureau Veritas - "Heavy Weather Securings" (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.3.37</a> - letter B.V. to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.75</a> - photo showing mock-up of the manual side lock). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Three strong locating 
    horns - one on the forepeak deck called "pyramid" and one at each front bulkhead 
    of the vessel - engaged recesses in the visor bottom respectively on both 
    aft bulkheads of the visor when in closed position and were intended to absorb 
    lateral loads.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> In closed position 
    the visor bottom rested on the forepeak deck mainly in way of the strong stempost 
    which took about 75% of its weight, whilst two steel pads welded to the forepeak 
    deck at the aft part of the visor bottom took a further ca. 20% and the remaining 
    5% were absorbed by the rubber packings. The visor was kept down by its weight 
    and the 3 (or 5) locking devices which pulled the visor tight against the 
    rubber packings on forepeak deck and both front bulkheads. Thereby any possible 
    play was eliminated and the visor's inside was kept watertight. Forces acting 
    in the forward/aft direction on the visor were transferred by the hinges, 
    the locking devices and the front bulkheads into the structure of the vessel. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">In open position 
    the visor was secured by 2 parking devices consisting of 2 hydraulically operated 
    bolts with mating lugs at the aft end of both visor arms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> For further details 
    of the visor, its maintenance, operation, opening and closing, etc. reference 
    is made to the relevant parts of the von Tell Manual attached as<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.69.htm" target="_blank">

<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Most 
    important was the Atlantic lock or bottom lock. The arrangement is shown in 
    the sketch below. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/report%20pics/folder%201/pg117.jpg" width="426" height="234"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This locking device 
    consisted of a locking bolt (1), movable horizontally in a transverse direction, 
    guided in a bolt housing (2). In extended position the tip of the bolt engaged 
    a support bushing (3). The bolt housing was fixed to the forepeak deck by 
    means of two steel lugs (4) and the bushing was installed in a third similar 
    lug (5), to which a support bracket (6) was fitted. A mating lug (7), attached 
    to the visor itself, was located between the bolt housing and the support 
    bushing when the visor was in the closed position and the extended bolt then 
    engaged the hole in the mating lug.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bolt was moved 
    in the bolt housing between the retracted position and the extended position 
    by means of an hydraulic actuator (8), operated from the control panel located 
    behind the bow and the ramp on the car deck. A spring-loaded mechanical plunger 
    (9), perpendicular to the bolt, engaged grooves in the bolt in the open and 
    closed position, thereby securing the bolt mechanically in its extreme positions, 
    regardless of hydraulic pressure. The bolt was also locked hydraulically at 
    any time because the hydraulic fluid was trapped in the system, regardless 
    of whether the hydraulic system was under pressure or not. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">The mating lug at 
    the aft end of the bottom of the visor consisted of a single steel lug, welded 
    to a transverse beam of the visor bottom structure and supported by a bracket. 
    The lug had a hole for the locking bolt with an original diameter of 85 millimetres 
    (see <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.70.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.70</a> 
    - drawing of Atlantic lock).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> When the bolt was 
    moving from open to closed position or the other way round, a vertical plate 
    (10), fitted to the bolt initially, contacted 2 mechanical limit switches 
    fitted to the sensor plate (11), which activated the indicator lights on the 
    control panel on the car deck to show "red" when the bolt was open and "green" 
    when the bolt was in closed position. In case the bolt would be in an intermittent 
    position there would be no indicator light shining.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The control panel 
    was located at the forepart of the car deck at port side (see<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.71.htm" target="_blank"> 
    Enclosure 2.6.2.71</a> - Photo of ESTONIA with the open visor and control 
    panel and <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.72.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.72</a> - Car deck with closed bow ramp). Details of the control panel 
    can be taken from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.72.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.4.81.</a> The above description as well as the relevant drawing show the 
    condition at the time the vessel was delivered to AB Sally in June 1980.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The Hydraulic 
    Side Locks</b> were installed at about 1/3 of the height of the visor and 
    consisted of two lugs, mounted to the aft bulkheads of the visor and extending, 
    when the visor was closed, into two openings in the front bulkheads of the 
    hull, inside the rubber packings, whereafter hydraulically operated bolts 
    engaged the holes of the visor lugs. The hydraulic bolt installations were 
    similar to that of the Atlantic lock, i.e. a bolt moving in a bolt housing 
    and, when extended, engaging a support bushing. The visor lug inserted between 
    the bolt housing and the support bushing. The bolt was moved by a hydraulic 
    actuator. The position of the bolt, fully retracted and fully extended, was 
    sensed by magnetic type limit switches activating indicator lights.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Additional hydraulic 
    cylinders - so-called ice-cylinders - were installed at each side to push 
    in a forward direction on the visor lugs when the visor was to open. This 
    installation was intended to assist in breaking the visor open in case it 
    had become frozen fast in closed position. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Two vertical stiffeners 
    were installed on the front side of the plating separated by a distance slightly 
    larger than the thickness of the lug itself, to comply with the remark on 
    drawing 49111-330 made by the plan approver of B.V., i.e.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <i>»Local reinforcements 
      of the ship's structure in way of locking devices to surveyor's satisfaction.«</i> 
      (see Subchapter 2.4.3. above). </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Directly below these 
    hydraulic side locks, at each side a further set of locking devices, the "manual 
    side locks", were installed consisting of a strong bolt with nut at vessel's 
    side and a strong hook at each side of the visor's aft bulkheads, which also 
    extended through a similar narrow opening into the ship's side. The arrangements 
    of hydraulic and manual side locks can be seen from a respective photo attached 
    as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.74.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 2.6.2.74. 
    </a>The photo shows the hydraulic lock closed, whilst the manual lock is not 
    engaged. In order to demonstrate the dimensions a photo of the mock-up of 
    the manual side lock is attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.75.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.75.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> After closing of 
    the hydraulic side locks from the control panel on the A-deck the operator 
    or somebody else had to walk into the port side house, up the stairs to B-deck, 
    forward beside the chain locker, then climb through an opening in the deck 
    down into the void space on A-deck from where both the hydraulic and manual 
    side locks were accessible and the bolt of the manual lock could easily be 
    moved between the hooks of the visor. The same procedure had to be repeated 
    at starboard side. The distance to be covered from the control panel to close 
    both port and starboard manual side locks is only about 38 m. The way to walk 
    can be seen from <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.6.2.76.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.6.2.76</a> (2 pages).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The manual side 
    locks are called "reserve" locking devices in the von Tell manual (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.31.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.31</a>), but B.V. calls them in their letter to the JAIC dated 10.01.95 
    »2 manually operated fasteners for heavy weather« (<a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.3.37.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.37</a>). - See also Subchapter 2.4.2 / 2.4.3.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>The Visor Hinges</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The hinges, around 
    which the visor was opening and closing, consisted of a steel/bronze bushing 
    system fitted through holes in the side plates of the visor arms and two steel 
    lugs with a housing in between welded at both ends of the visor arms to the 
    forecastle deck plating. A stainless steel bolt was leading through each of 
    the assemblies at port and starboard side. Securing plates bolted to the outer 
    respectively inner sides of all four steel bushings prevented moving out of 
    the bolt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> The bearings were 
    lubricated through drillings in the bolt and grease nipples at its ends. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">Also the hinge arrangement 
    was von Tell design and the bushings, and subsequently the bolts, were installed 
    under the strict supervision of the von Tell representative Günther Todsen. 
    His statement - attached as <a href="enclosures%20HTM/2.4.2.21.htm" target="_blank">Enclosure 
    2.4.2.21</a> - shall be quoted in connection with the hinge installation as 
    follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> <b>Installation 
      of the Hinges </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"><i>»The bore holes 
      for the bushings were carried out in the shipbuilding hall by means of the 
      a boring machine. I had personally checked and touched the bore holes before 
      the bushings were installed and do confirm that the holes in the visor arms 
      were by no means burnt out. Anyway, I never would have accepted such bungled 
      work as can be on the photos showing the remains of the visor hinge plates 
      of the ESTONIA. In such case that the Yard would not have accepted my objections, 
      I would have the left the vessel and informed my principals.<br>
      </i></font><i><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2">This 
      happened for example on a vessel at Dunkirk. I was instructed to carry out 
      repairs to some hatch covers. When the crew refused to supply me with the 
      spare parts necessary to perform a proper repair (although these spare parts 
      were on board) and a proper repair, based on my professional experience, 
      would not have been possible otherwise, I refused to carry on working and 
      returned to Kiel. <br>
      The steel bushings were welded into the visor arms under my supervision 
      and subsequently milled to such an extent that the bronze bushings did fit. 
      These bore holes were performed very exactly to assure that the port and 
      starboard sides were in exact alignment in order to avoid excessive loads 
      on the hinges during opening and closing of the visor. Thereafter the shafts 
      were inserted, whereby also the distance rings were put in place (2 mm thick). 
      I do remember this work in particular, because it was difficult, time consuming, 
      and required a lot of care. The shafts were made of NIROSTA (stainless) 
      steel and had grease grooves with grease nipples. By means of these grease 
      nipples the hinges had to be greased at least once a week.«</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman" size="2"> Todsen as well as 
    the Meyer Werft managers and employees have time and again confirmed that 
    the bore holes in the visor arms for the steel bushings had been drilled and 
    not burned and, as a matter of fact, the port outer part of the visor hinge 
    plate still shows circumferential drilling marks. The sketch below shows the 
    hinge arrangements in detail. </font></p>
